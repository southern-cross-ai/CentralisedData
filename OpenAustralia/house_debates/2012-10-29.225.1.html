       <p class="italic">
        That the motion be amended to read—That the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges the significant community contribution Meals on Wheels Australia has made to the most vulnerable in our society for nearly 60 years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) values the many Meals on Wheels Australia volunteers that selflessly dedicate their time to ensure that our local communities' most vulnerable members receive warm and nutritious meals;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that Meals on Wheels Australia allows elderly people to maintain their independence and provides them with regular social contact;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges that nearly one-third of frail patients admitted to hospital are malnourished and that a further 60 per cent are at risk of malnutrition; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) consider the Meals on Wheels Australia's initiative to research new ways to improve the nutritional status of elderly Australians; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognise that this initiative to improve nutrition has the potential to change the health, happiness and well-being of elderly Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a well known fact that there are over 80,000 volunteers and workers at over 750 branches of Meals on Wheels across Australia who every year selflessly dedicate their time and effort to ensure that close to 15 million meals are delivered to our aged residents and people with disabilities. Since its inception 55 years ago, providing meals to only eight people, the service has grown to become one of Australia's most vital volunteer institutions. I might add that the Meals on Wheels was actually started by a lady delivering meals on a tricycle.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I would like to focus on tonight is the Meals on Wheels Australia's initiative to research new ways to improve the nutritional status of elderly Australians. They had a very good promotion. A very good program that we are seeking funding for. The total cost over three years was $890,000. The Meals on Wheels had secured $464,000 with $426,000 to be funded over three years. On average, $142,000 per year. It already received funding from the Balnaves Foundation and Nestle, and in-kind support from both the universities and Meals on Wheels South Australia. The potential benefits to Australia are massive.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, unfortunately, the Balnaves funding was subject to federal government funding. Where the Meals on Wheels Association were trying to go is that the statistics that show that 60 per cent of elderly Australians admitted to hospital are either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. Considering that Meals on Wheels were in that space of delivering 50 million per year, they felt that a nutrition study to clearly identify the nutritional status and needs of elderly Australians would be of great benefit to the Australian people. For the Australian government—that is us—and the taxpayers of Australia to have this organisation filling that gap, largely through voluntary contributions is great. Obviously the government does fund a large part of the meals, but they are delivered on a voluntary basis. It is a huge cost that is removed from the Australian taxpayers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that as our population ages and we clearly are heading to the peak in our population bubble with the baby-boomers reaching that need of high care in the year 2030 and beyond, a clear indication of the nutritional needs of elderly Australians is clearly in order.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to finally acknowledge the great work that Meals on Wheels Australia does; the great work that the 80,000 volunteers do and the need that they have—and I would hope that this House would see its way fit to support them in their endeavours in the future.

        <p>
         I rise to echo the sentiments of the member for Parkes and join him in expressing support for the work of Meals on Wheels Australia. Meals on Wheels provide an invaluable service in so many of our communities around the country. In fact, there are over 750 branches operating throughout Australia, delivering meals to around 53,000 people. There is a fantastic level of services, thanks predominately to the dedication and commitment of around 80,000 volunteers. Meals on Wheels is about more than just a meal, as their motto goes. Since its establishment in Australia in 1952, Meals on Wheels has been providing social support and interaction to clients alongside their nutritious, healthy meals. Most of us want to stay in our homes as we age and Meals on Wheels plays an important role in maintaining the independence of our seniors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Services are provided at low price, usually at cost, and are not means-tested, though many clients are pensioners and on limited budgets. Meals on Wheels can also cater for people with disabilities as well as carers who may not have the skills or the time needed to stay healthy at meal times without assistance. In some cases where volunteer support and finances allow, Meals on Wheels can also provide temporary support to others such as new mums immediately after the birth of a baby or to a partner or spouse following the death of a loved one.
        </p>
        <p>
         The services offered by Meals on Wheels can provide comfort to loved ones secure in the knowledge that someone will be checking in on their mum or dad or grandma at home on a regular basis. We also know that for some Meals on Wheels clients the volunteers dropping off their meals are the only visitors they ever have. In these circumstances a friendly word or a smile from a volunteer can make a world of difference in the lives of the people receiving meals. But the service is not just benefiting its clients. We know the rewards of volunteer work are significant for communities and for individual volunteers. Volunteer work is a great way to be part of and give back to your community, to meet new people and to keep active in unemployment or retirement.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am proud to say that, according to the 2011 census data, almost 18,000 people in the Petrie electorate are doing or have done volunteer work at an organisation or community group such as Meals on Wheels. That is an amazing number and I pay tribute to every single one of those volunteers. Thank you for your contribution to our community. Meals on Wheels relies almost solely on the support of volunteers and as a result the community spirit instilled into the service and by it is heart-warming. Meals on Wheels gives volunteers the opportunity to make new friends and learn new skills, all the while helping those in need within our community.

         On 28 August this year I was pleased to attend the Redcliffe Meals on Wheels annual general meeting. Incidentally, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
          AGM
         </a>
         was held the day before national Meals on Wheels Day, celebrated annually on the last Wednesday in August. I would like to acknowledge the work of this branch, which has been servicing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcliffe_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Redcliffe Peninsula
         </a>
         since 1967. I congratulate the new executive, many of whom are long-serving volunteers with the organisation. During its existence Redcliffe Meals on Wheels has delivered over 2½ million meals to local residents. Within my electorate we are fortunate to be serviced by a total of five Meals on wheels branches. As well as Redcliffe, I acknowledge the work of Sandgate,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Deception Bay
         </a>
         , Burpengary and Geebung. The number of clients these services alone deliver meals to provides some perspective on the value they bring to our community and how many seniors and families rely on them. Deception Bay delivers around 30 meals a day, Burpengary delivers between 250 and 300 meals per week and Sandgate delivers over 1,300 meals weekly. Last financial year the Geebung service delivered over 40,000 meals and this financial year Redcliffe is funded to deliver close to 70,000 meals to locals.
        </p>
        <p>
         I take this opportunity behalf of my community to congratulate our local services on the great work they do and sincerely thank the volunteers who give up their time for the benefit and well-being of some of our most vulnerable residents. Meals on Wheels is always looking for new volunteers and with Christmas approaching they need all the help they can get, so I urge people considering volunteer work to contact their local Meals on Wheels services and get involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         In recognition of the value and importance of the Meals on Wheels service, the federal government provides financial support through the Home and Community Care program. This financial year our government is providing $24 million for delivered meal services through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HACC" rel="nofollow">
          HACC
         </a>
         . I am pleased to see that over $6 million of that funding is committed in Queensland to support the delivery of more than two million meals statewide. Furthermore, as the member for Parkes may be aware, on 31 July this year the Commonwealth HACC resource unit partnered with Queensland Meals on Wheels to co-host a workshop 'Making the most of nutrition in Meals on Wheels'. The one-day workshop put together Meals on Wheels services, HACC service providers, dieticians, allied health and other health professionals, working with Meals on Wheels services and frail aged clients. Events like this workshop provides an important opportunity for stakeholders to raise issues such as nutrition with frail aged clients.

          <p>
           I welcome the opportunity to second the amendment to the motion moved by my friend and colleague the member for Parkes. Meals on Wheels is a cause that is very close to my heart. There is no disputing the fact that this organisation has played an absolutely vital role in our community for more than 60 years. I commend Meals on Wheels Australia for not resting on their laurels but continually looking at ways that they can do things even better. Their initiative to research new ways to improve the nutritional status of elderly Australians should not and cannot be sidelined. I was very disappointed to hear that there has been a distinct lack of support by federal, state and territory governments on the proposed nutrition project. This is despite the Balnaves Foundation in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           agreeing to fund $200,000 of the project's costs. Unfortunately, while waiting for any indication of support from the federal and state governments, that funding commitment has now expired. I have to say: what an absolute waste. This is typical of a government that is determined to splurge billions of dollars it does not have on projects with little or no relevance to the average person but yet cannot support an absolutely vital project such as this.
          </p>
          <p>
           In my electorate of Leichhardt, the Cairns, Marlin Coast and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Douglas" rel="nofollow">
            Port Douglas
           </a>
           -Mossman branches of Meals on Wheels together produce more than 1,100 meals per week. Over the year, that is more than 57,000 regular meals. Chris Schreyer, volunteer coordinator at the Cairns branch, told me that Meals on Wheels plays a huge role. Of course we know this. She said that for some people it is just a social visit, while for many others it is the only reason that they can stay in their own homes. Rosemary Klein, from the Marlin Coast branch, said that the service is certainly vital to many people in the region who are 'getting on' a little in years and know they can no longer cook for themselves but do not want—or, in many cases, cannot afford—to move into a retirement home or an aged-care facility. They are really keen on staying in their own homes. Rosemary told me:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The social support element of our service cannot be underestimated. If people have surgery and go into the hospital, our service is vital in order for them to be released into their homes earlier, so they can recover in their own environment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, when older people are on their own, the incentive and ability to cook their own meals is one of the first areas that appears to suffer. This is why nearly one-third of frail patients admitted to hospital are malnourished and a further 60 per cent are at risk of malnutrition.
          </p>
          <p>
           I myself have done volunteer work over a number of years with Cairns Meals on Wheels. Recently I volunteered with Douglas Shire Meals on Wheels and saw firsthand just how these clients appreciated knowing that someone is keeping an eye on them while their families and friends are often away. In my electorate it is no secret that older people, whether self-funded retirees or pensioners, are struggling to make ends meet. Cost of living pressures are a real issue, not only in my electorate but right across Australia. In my area for example, home insurance is going through the roof and food and electricity bills are starting to sky rocket. To get a very generously portioned meal at a subsidised price goes a long way towards helping reduce their financial stress.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would also like to acknowledge the vital role that Meals on Wheels volunteers play in our communities, as without them the service would not be viable or possible. Day in, day out, these volunteers are up at the crack of dawn, preparing, cooking and packaging filling meals that are delivered to the clients in their homes. There are all sorts of onerous requirements now on many of these volunteers. They often say to me, 'We come here to help serve meals, not to fill out applications for police checks and a whole range of other things.' These are people who pay for their own fuel and give willingly of their time. We need to support them and make it easier for them to continue to volunteer.
          </p>
          <p>
           In closing, I strongly urge the government today to support Meals on Wheels Australia's nutrition project. Good nutrition is a vital ingredient for a healthy body, a happy mindset and an active lifestyle, so I call on this government to commit to providing some meaningful assistance to the most vulnerable sectors within our community.

            I too want to speak in support of Meals on Wheels, and I thank the honourable member for Parkes for bringing this motion before the House. My seat of Page has seven branches of Meals of Wheels: Lismore, Ballina, Casino, Kyogle District Care Connections, Meals on Wheels Iluka Association Incorporated, Maclean Lower Clarence Meals on Wheels and Grafton Meals on Wheels. The dedicated Meals on Wheels committees lead about 1,200 hardworking volunteers across Page. As I have said in this House before, I suppose that makes it two battalions of people. They cook and deliver an average of 600 meals a week and they operate on Meals on Wheels
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

            values of compassion, care, respect, teamwork and integrity.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of what I call my Page priorities was to help the Meals on Wheels Iluka Association Incorporated secure a new meals kitchen. I am pleased to say I opened that kitchen in August last year. I was able to help them with a good grant so they were able to build that kitchen. The modern kitchen is named after two local Meals on Wheels stayers: Mrs Ida Johnson, in her early 90s, who had a stroke earlier this year and now lives in aged care in nearby Maclean, and Mrs Dorian Cupitt, in her early 80s, of Iluka. So it is called Ida and Doreen's Kitchen, and it is a great kitchen. Doreen is a foundation member of Iluka Meals on Wheels from when the organisation was first established in 1979 and she is a former treasurer. Ida volunteered with Meals on Wheels for 44 years in Iluka, where she was Meals on Wheels committee president and, before that, in the

            I would like to pay tribute to the Meals on Wheels committee president Kingsley Cornwall, vice president Colin Kempshall, secretary Kaye Becker, Marion Kurz, Olive Pavey and Aileen Cameron for sticking with their six-year mission to secure a new kitchen. They did not only lobby; they got out and did a lot of hard work and raised funds as well. Iluka Meals on Wheels coordinator Eleanor Moor, relief coordinator Desiree Auer, new cook

            and 70 volunteers love their spacious kitchen. They use fresh ingredients and cook hot lunchtime meals for more than 30 elderly residents in Iluka and Woombah.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to praise the Iluka community, including the Iluka Bowls Club, Iluka Golf Club and Sedgers Reef Hotel, for raising a total of $77,000 from raffles, donations, a garage sale and a cent auction sale. A lot of hard work went into raising that $77,000. This was a mammoth effort from a small but strong community and testament to what can be done with a will.

           <p>
            It is the same will that I was able to bring to bear to advocate to get the crucial funding—the extra $240,000—that came by way of a FaHCSIA grant to enable the kitchen to be built. Because the community demonstrated the need, did the hard yards and also raised funds, that always makes the job of lobbying easier. Again, it was not easy, but like the community effort, it was one worth doing and persisting with, and I did, and it paid off with this great community asset.
