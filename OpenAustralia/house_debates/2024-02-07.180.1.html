       <p>
        A strong Medicare and bulk-billing are among the most important and valuable elements of our community services. In Australia, health care is a right, not a privilege. In Australia, people have access to health care based on their need, not just on their ability to pay. Free access to primary health care is not just important because it's a right for all Australians; it makes really good economic sense. People who have strong access to primary care are more likely to have illnesses detected early. They're more likely to engage in preventive activities, improving their overall health and reducing the long-term cost to our healthcare system.
       </p>

        I'm pleased to say that Parramatta is a stronghold of Medicare and a stronghold of bulk-billing. Parramatta has the 10th-highest bulk-billing rates of anywhere in Australia. When the data recently came out for October 2023, it showed that 93 per cent of all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        appointments in Parramatta were bulk-billed. I was pleased to see, when the new data came out in December, that the rate of bulk-billing in Parramatta had gone up. After decades of decline chipping away at bulk-billing, for the first time we had an increase in bulk-billing rates in Parramatta.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pioneer Medical Practice in Stockland Merrylands, since the incentive, have increased the number of bulk-billed consultations offered to their patients, because it's now $14 easier to do this compared to before the incentive was introduced. Pioneer Medical Practice now bulk-bills for all Medicare cardholders.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Myhealth Medical Centre in Parramatta Westfield, they used to only bulk-bill on weekdays for patients 16 years and under. But, since the incentive, they've begun bulk-billing for these patients every day of the week. At Granville Family Medical Centre, they bulk-bill on weekdays for all patients, and, since the incentive, they say their doctors are paid more, and their patients, most of whom are pensioners and concession cardholders, have experienced significant benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to the Albanese government, bulk-billing has now stabilised and begun to rise again, enabling GPs to bulk-bill more patients who need care the most. This is incredibly important right across the country and especially in Parramatta, where bulk-billing means so much to our constituents.
