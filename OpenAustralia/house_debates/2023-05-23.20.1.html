        s ROBERTS () (): There are times in life when one is inspired by the incredible achievements of others who have faced adversity and pushed through to reach and exceed personal goals. Today I rise to speak about one such individualâ€”
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Lee" rel="nofollow">
         Aaron Lee
        </a>
        , a friend and former local government colleague. He competed in the World Transplant Games recently held in my electorate of Pearce. He won a gold medal for Australia in the individual cycling time trial and a bronze in a team trial and road race. These medals were won just two years after Aaron's life-saving heart transplant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aaron has told me that he is so very grateful to his heart donor for giving him a second chance. Aaron wants to encourage more Australians to have the important conversation about organ donation so that more people can benefit from organ transplants. He says discussing organ donation is the best way to let your family know your wishes, and then to register that intention.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the honour of presenting medals to Aaron, his teammates and medal winners from visiting countries at the World Transplant Games and left feeling very inspired by the energy and resolve of all the athletes who competed. I congratulate those remarkable athletes on their achievements and also thank those who chose to donate to give others a life-saving opportunity.
