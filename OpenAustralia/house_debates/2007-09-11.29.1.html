        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Is the minister aware that in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        all horse related community functions have been stopped—all riding in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Garnet" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Garnet
        </a>
        ; the Atherton races; horse sports at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Isa
        </a>
        —yet they are all 2,500 kilometres from the nearest confirmed equine influenza case? The state
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPI" rel="nofollow">
         DPI
        </a>
        s are now clearly applying protocols to Australian horse activities that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
         AQIS
        </a>
        never applied to their operations at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Creek
        </a>
        . Could the minister advise whether therefore state DPIs are acting with an excessive abuse of power or whether AQIS’s protocols were gross and irresponsible breaches of their duty of care? Finally, could the minister assure the House that outbreak areas are being rigidly quarantined and universal vaccination is being initiated throughout these areas? And, most importantly, could he assure the House that AQIS’s continuing appalling record of supinely saying ‘yes’ to all import applications will this time be punished?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I fully appreciate the hardship being caused to the horse industries of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         , and elsewhere in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland, as the indefinite ban on the movement of horses continues. The core of the honourable member’s question will be addressed by former High Court Judge Ian Callinan as he conducts his inquiry into the source of the equine influenza outbreak and makes an assessment of the quarantine system. All going well, tomorrow I will be introducing into the House the powers needed for him to subpoena persons and documents. He has signalled he will conduct public hearings on a needs basis. I will also be releasing the terms of reference which he has agreed upon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The honourable member has asked me a number of questions about state
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPI" rel="nofollow">
          DPI
         </a>
         s. I should simply say that I think they are doing brilliant work on the ground tracing the number of horses and identifying the infected premises in an attempt to contain and eradicate the infection. I cannot say the same for the state governments of New South Wales and Queensland which have done nothing in any way to mitigate the economic loss of thousands of businesses and individuals.

            Mr Speaker, it is fascinating. They always jump to their feet to defend a Labor government that has done nothing to assist the industries or people within their borders. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            and Queensland governments earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year in gaming and waging revenue and not a cent has gone towards the affected people. I will conclude my answer by offering the honourable member a briefing. He has made a number of assumptions regarding vaccination and zoning that, respectfully, are not quite right. I would be very happy to talk to him before much longer.
