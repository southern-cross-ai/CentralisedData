              GP

             superclinics announced by the federal government will all have GPs in them, as our commitments have made clear. The

             n government and the federal government will be working together on a number of sites. A number of those sites are going to be jointly funded by the state government and the Commonwealth.

              The Commonwealth

             will require that the parameters set for our superclinics will be met by any state government.

             I think that it has been quite mischievous of the member to be raising this issue when he knows full well that the

             </a>
             strategy, although complementary to that being supported by the Rudd Labor government, is not the same as that being initiated by the Rudd Labor government. These superclinics we are very proud of. They are an opportunity for the federal government to use their substantial contribution to ensure that we do get doctors, nurses and allied health professionals working together for the benefit of the community, providing better chronic disease care management—making sure that parents of young children can go to the one place to get the assistance of a doctor, a dietitian, a physio and others. These are an opportunity for us to make a real difference to the services that are provided in these regions.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know members on this side of the House—including, I am sure, the member for Makin, where the Modbury superclinic will be established—are very pleased that there is a Commonwealth government prepared to invest in health services across this country, prepared to put money into health services in communities where they are needed, and make sure that the Commonwealth investment is used to make sure that we can attract, in particular, doctors to a number of places where there are shortages and where we can work with state governments to complement the money that they are going to put into these sectors as well. In the member for Makin’s electorate, there is going to be a superclinic in Modbury. There are going to be 31 other superclinics, and they will be designed—
