        This Friday is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Teachers'_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Teachers' Day
        </a>
        , a day for us to say thank you to teachers and acknowledge the incredible work that teachers are doing to shape our next generation of leaders. Education underpins our society, and without it we wouldn't have the country we have today. No matter what profession you choose, we all have to start somewhere. Although the foundations of education start with our parents, they are nurtured and strengthened by teachers as we navigate our way through kindergarten, primary school, high school and then tertiary education. During the school years, we learn not only to read and write but also to navigate personal growth and problem-solving. We learn how to make friends and how to work as a team. We learn that as individuals we each have our own voice and our own opportunity to make a difference in the world. Our teachers are constantly empowering our children to become the next leaders, influencers, and innovators of our nation. As the husband of a former teacher I understand the extra voluntary hours they do, and as the father of three school-age boys I understand the personal contribution their teachers make to their education. I want to thank all the teachers in my electorate, especially on this Friday, World Teachers' Day.
