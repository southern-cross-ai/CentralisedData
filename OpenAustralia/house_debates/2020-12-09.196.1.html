        I'm proud to represent over 12,000 businesses in the Oxley electorate, and during what has been a difficult time for small business during the COVID-19 pandemic it's been wonderful to work with my local chambers of commerce in their efforts to connect and support business owners. Businesses in the Oxley electorate are strong and resilient and have adapted to the current changing times. The chambers and their members aim to support and facilitate the continued growth of our business community while advocating a spirit of collaboration amongst all members.

        I was delighted to attend this important event with my local state member, Mrs Charis Mullen, who was also recently appointed as the assistant minister to the Treasurer in Queensland. She represents the state seat of Jordan, which is the electorate that encompasses the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce. I was also delighted to attend with Councillor Nicole Jonic and the mayor of Ipswich, Mayor Teresa Harding. I want to give a special shout-out to the organisers of the evening, particularly Leila Stewart, the hardest working secretary of any chamber of commerce in Australia, I believe, and the president, Mr Neil Coupland, for his attention to detail to make sure the awards went so smoothly. COVID-19 has shown the resilience and support for many of our businesses—and they've demonstrated that they're up to the challenge.

        On Friday evening I was back at the Brookwater Golf &amp;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Country Club
        </a>
        to launch a new business, Boulevard at Brookwater, by Mark and Cilla, who are a fantastic local business couple, who have provided a new, fresh business that I know will be supported by many, many in the community. I was joined by the Brisbane Lady Mayoress Nina Schrinner and Councillor Nicole Jonic as we congratulated them on the opening of this new enterprise—a fitting and iconic way as we see our community build back jobs, tourism, retail and in turn the economy for a strong brighter future.
