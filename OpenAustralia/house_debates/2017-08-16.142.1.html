        , for recently visiting my electorate and briefing local employers, industry groups and training providers on opportunities for workforce development available under the federal government's vocational education and training programs, and in particular the new Skilling Australians Fund. The Skilling Australians Fund is designed to support apprenticeships and traineeships in

        as our state transitions away from the mining and construction boom to new and emerging industries. It will provide practical opportunities for those seeking to change their career in related industries. The government has committed to ongoing engagement with industry, closely collaborating with employers to ensure that training projects supported by the fund are able to deliver real employment outcomes.

        The Skilling Australians Fund will target growing and emerging industries and occupations, such as those in technology and tourism, to ensure that our nation has the skilled workforce which employers need. Local stakeholders in vocational education and apprenticeships met with Assistant Minister Karen Andrews around the boardroom table to discuss the government's strategy to promote renewed interest in apprenticeships and traineeships. Vocational education and training organisations based in Joondalup will benefit from this initiative, including both campuses of the North Metropolitan

        will commit an estimated $1.5 billion over the next four years under the Skilling Australians Fund, which will be matched by state and territory governments, to support 300,000 apprenticeships, traineeships, pre-apprenticeships and higher-level apprenticeships. Western Australia will be eligible for an estimated $38 million in 2017-18 through the fund. The Skilling Australians Fund represents a great opportunity for our state and for the electorate of Moore, providing a much-needed boost to the local economy and delivering valuable opportunities for those looking to start a new career. The fund will be complemented by the new $60 million Industry Specialist Mentoring program, which will provide 45,000 mentoring places for Australian apprentices and support the supply of skilled workers in industries undergoing structural change. This fund will prioritise projects in Western Australia that support apprenticeships and traineeships in high-demand areas, with a strong emphasis on accountability, transparency and the delivery of clear outcomes.
