        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities. Will the minister update the House on how the government is delivering on its record $75 billion investment into transport infrastructure in Queensland, including in my electorate of Fisher? How is the government's investment in the

         I thank the member for Fisher, who's a very strong advocate for the infrastructure needs of his electorate as part of the fast-growing

         . And of course he's part of 'team Queensland', the Liberal-Nationals team delivering outcomes for their state and their community. The member for Fisher, together with the member for Fairfax, recently had a huge win for his community, securing a $390 million commitment for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail project, just one of the many wins that have been secured by the

         and Griffith—the member for Dickson and the member for Petrie. There was $390 million for Beerburrum to Nambour—an extremely important achievement for the members for Fisher and Fairfax.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, so important is it that it was recently described in the
         <i>
          Caboolture Shire Herald
         </i>
         as both 'welcome' and 'important'. Now, the person who gave that quote was a little bit forgetful: she forgot to mention that so far Queensland Labor has not yet put any money on the table for Beerburrum to Nambour. We certainly hope they do so soon. But it's not surprising that she was a bit forgetful about that, because we know that she's forgetful about a few other things as well—she forgot she was a British citizen! So now the person who gave that quote is the ex-member for Longman. But it was good of her to recognise the extraordinary achievement of the member for Fisher and the member for Fairfax. The fact is that if you want infrastructure delivered in Queensland you need to go to team LNP. So I say to the people of Longman, you've got a great opportunity now. You can put somebody else into the LNP team Queensland and deliver even more infrastructure for Queensland, just as team LNP is doing such a terrific job of.
