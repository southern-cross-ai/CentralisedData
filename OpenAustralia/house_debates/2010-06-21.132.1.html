        Chief Electrical Artificer and acting Chief Petty Officer Allen Leslie Smith was somebody I would have called uncle if he had lived. He was onboard

        when it was attacked by the
        <i>
         Kormoran,
        </i>
        which had been masquerading as a Dutch merchant ship. The battle that ensued meant that every single solitary Australian member of the ship’s company—all 645—was lost. Of the
        <i>
         Kormoran
        </i>
        , the ship that had acted with deception and lured the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        so that it lost its firepower advantage, had 317 survivors and lost 80.
       </p>
       <p>
        The stories that have surrounded the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        and its wonderful and luminous history prior to it being lost are of the legend variety. The
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        in 1941 had taken part in battles in the Mediterranean as part of the 7th Cruiser Mediterranean fleet. The
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        had in battle torpedoed and fired upon Italian ships and had been responsible for sinking the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeo_Colleoni" rel="nofollow">
          Bartolomeo Colleoni
         </a>
        </i>
        . As Captain Collins—after whom we named our Collins class submarines—ordered the finishing of that ship, cruiser
        <i>
         Havock
        </i>
        , which was acting in this battle with the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        , was standing by to take survivors from the ship.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Sydney_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Finding Sydney Foundation
        </a>
        was formed everyone was delighted that finally a proper search would be made for the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        and some of the mystery could be solved. When the ship and the
        <i>
         Kormoran
        </i>
        were found and we heard again the story of the last half-hour of the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        the only version being the German version—we commemorated the ship and all of her company with a very fine service at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew" rel="nofollow">
         St Andrew
        </a>
        ’s Cathedral. The stories of the ship, her courage and her company were celebrated as well as commemorated.

        In recent times I have had discussions with Allen Leslie Smith’s son, my cousin. As I said, Allen died before I was born, but obviously my cousin lost his dad.

         He and I

        together are very incensed, as are others in my electorate, about the plaque that is being sent to Germany. It has been negotiated by the Finding Sydney Foundation, after completing arrangements with the German Naval Association and accepting words for the plaque to be sent to Germany to a war museum. The plaque says:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS Sydney
        </a>
        on 19 November 1941, 80 Kormoran men and 645 Sydney men were killed. Both ships sank due to the damage they had suffered in battle. In March 2008 the wrecks of Kormoran and Sydney were located by the Finding Sydney Foundation. Today we reach out our hands in friendship, to commemorate those who died at sea together.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In memory of those who died in battle, and to remind the living.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        May the men from both ships rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not an honourable battle.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_German" rel="nofollow">
         The German
        </a>
        ship behaved dishonourably. To whitewash the fact that all Australians were lost and 317 Germans were rescued is to whitewash the greatest loss of naval personnel in the history of Australia. As someone who does have a personal connection and acknowledges it, it is wrong that this plaque be sent.
