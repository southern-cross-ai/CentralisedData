       <p>
        Four years ago, on 23 September 2014, my staff and I were leaving this building. It had been a long day. It was cold and dark, and the conditions matched my mood. Part of this mood was because of my conviction that this country would experience a terrorist attack. In fact, earlier in the year, on 14 July, I stated in this House that eventually and inevitably an event would occur in this country, on this soil, of the magnitude of the Bali event, or just a terrorism event—just.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that fateful evening, I knew the security level had just been raised to 'high' by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        and the government. I knew that our agencies were gravely concerned about ISIL and the number of those in Australian influenced by this insidious group. I also knew that ISIL had just issued a fatwa which called for the death of soldiers and civilians in countries including Australia, and that Western intelligence agencies were attempting to assess the impact of this fatwa. They wouldn't have to wait long.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also knew that our intelligence and security authorities had just conducted raids in Sydney and Melbourne which sought to disrupt an ISIL plot to abduct and kill random members of the public. On that night, as we were leaving, a highly regarded journalist rang my staff member on his mobile phone to advise him of an incident at the Endeavour Hills Police Station. It involved the serious wounding of two police officers in what appeared to be a terrorist attack. Given that the police station was some 300 metres from where I had previously lived for many years, this literally struck particularly close to home. I went back upstairs to my office, and as the evening unfolded we learnt the true horror of the event that had taken place—that a young man aged 18 had attempted to attack and kill two counterterrorism officers. Both officers were seriously wounded. One officer suffered life-threatening injuries and the other officer, though seriously injured himself, had shot and killed the young man—a young radicalised man who was carrying out an ISIL-inspired terrorist attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        After that dark night, we learned that this was one of the first ISIL-inspired attacks outside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        —in fact, the first of its type in the Western world. As a consequence of that attack and its aftermath, as well as the Anzac Day plots, the Lindt Cafe siege and other events, the security landscape of our country has changed forever. Australia had on that night its first bitter taste of ISIL-inspired attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        ISIL attacks continued not just in this country. There were the Paris attacks in 2015, the Brussels bombing in March 2016, the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017 and, even recently, the 13 July Pakistan bombings that killed 149 people. But this first attack, the Endeavour Hills Police Station attack, was thwarted by the bravery of the two officers, particularly Officer A. The shot fired by officer A literally ricocheted throughout the world. It demonstrated the deadly intent and reach of ISIL and their resolve to kill and terrorise police officers, even in countries like Australia. It also indicated that deadly force would be used to protect our country's interest, and it was used by Officer A.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, after these four years in which our world has changed I contacted those who are, I'm proud to say, my friends, Officers A and B, and asked them if there is anything they would like to say this to House and to the Australian people four years on. Officer A sent me the following message:
       </p>
       <p>
        'I am proud of my service to my country and equally proud of the continued dedication of my former colleagues within the national joint counterterrorism teams who continue to thwart terrorism attacks here, to keep Australia as safe as possible, and acknowledge the contribution of the community in working alongside police and the intelligence sector to keep thwarting those who wish to do our great country and our interests harm.'
       </p>
       <p>
        'When I reflect on it, if I was asked would I give my blood sweat and tears again to keep this nation safe, then the answer is a resounding, "Absolutely". Our soldiers, sailors and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        have performed with distinction on operations abroad and peacekeeping missions. When it comes to keeping the public safe from harm, then my small part was to hold the thin blue line and I am happy to have done that.'
       </p>
       <p>
        'On the cusp of National Police Remembrance Day, I pay tribute to all Australian policing colleagues who paid the ultimate price, whether feloniously slain or killed on duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Policing will always endure the challenges thrown at them by criminals and terrorists because that is why we are the police—to protect good from evil.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer A received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">

        Valour Award and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        Bravery Medal, the highest honours both organisations have for bravery. Officer B received an AFP Bravery Medal and the Medal for Courage from Victoria Police. As long as I remain in this place, I resolve to remind the public each September of the bravery of Officers A and B and to ensure we never forget their sacrifice, and that of our police and security agencies, in keeping us safe, particularly on that dark, dark September night.
