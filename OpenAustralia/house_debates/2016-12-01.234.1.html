        I rise today to recognise the contribution that people with disability make to communities right across Australia. This Saturday 3 December is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People With Disability. It is a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        sanctioned day and it seeks to raise public awareness, understanding and acceptance of people with disability and celebrate their achievements and their contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Assistant Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        and Disability Services, I encourage communities to come together to participate and to celebrate. This day gives all of us the opportunity to reflect on and acknowledge the positive impact people with disability have in our community. We should all consider what we can do to make sure people with disability have the same opportunities to pursue their dreams and reach their full potential. In my local area, I will be joining with international disability ambassador Karni Liddell and will be at the McIntyre Centre for riding for the disabled to recognise the wonderful work that they do in supporting young people with disability.

        Previously, on 7 November, I had the pleasure of attending the 2016 National Disability Awards dinner. There were many deserving recipients of awards this year and this special event highlighted the spirit amongst individuals, organisations, services and associated initiatives. All the winners and finalists were very deserving. I particularly recognise my own
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        for being awarded employer of the year. The Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , attended and presented Dr Peter Abolfathi with the excellence in technology award.
       </p>
       <p>
        This morning I hosted a morning tea for members and senators and peak disability organisations as well as members of the National Disability and Carers Advisory Council to recognise International Day of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_with_Disability" rel="nofollow">
         People with Disability
        </a>
        . I was delighted that Tony Dee, who was the voice behind the 2016 Rio Paralympics 'we are the superhumans' campaign was also able to attend, as he entertained everyone so well at the disability awards in November. A very special gift to everyone were some not melting moments but 'helping moments'. An
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE" rel="nofollow">
         ADE
        </a>
        by the name of Help Enterprises in Brisbane made some very special little 'helping moments' to give to everyone who was able to attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also delighted that the Minister for Social Services, the Honourable Christian Porter, could attend. He launched the second implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy. As he said, 2017 is going to be very important year for us all to work together to ensure that we support those with disability in our community. And we need to consider that there are 4.6 million people in Australia living with disability. The National Disability Insurance Scheme, while being absolutely wonderful and life changing for people with severe and significant disabilities, will only support 460,000, so there will be 4.2 million people with disability who we must continue to support and their carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        International Day of People with Disability will see many local events including morning teas, community exhibitions, sporting festivals and speaking events. I encourage everyone to join in and celebrate the day. Also, if you want to learn more about the day, of course we have a website—all good events have a website—idpwd.com.au. This Saturday, as I said, I will be joining Paralympian Karni Liddell. We are looking forward to hearing about celebrations being held across the rest of Australia and in other electorates.
       </p>
       <p>
        International Day of People with Disability is not only a day to celebrate the achievements and contributions of people with disability; it is also about highlighting the need to ensure that those with disability are afforded the same opportunities to reach their full potential and pursue their dreams. Whether those dreams are competing at the Paralympics like Karni Liddell has or riding a horse of the McIntyre Centre, we can all assist in making them a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all the people in the disability sector who are so devoted and dedicated to make sure that people with disability lead the lives that they want and achieve the goals that they aspire to.
