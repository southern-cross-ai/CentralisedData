        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_League" rel="nofollow">
         Lego League
        </a>
        , in Sydney on Tuesday 1 December. The Lego League is a worldwide event with 250,000 students from 90 countries competing in the event. The Grafton students were successful, and received a $5,000 robotic kit for the league event.
       </p>
       <p>
        The competition this year had a theme of waste and recycling, and the children had to come up with real-world solutions. The students identified disposal of everyday household batteries as a major concern. There research showed that 97 per cent of normal batteries—like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA" rel="nofollow">
         AA
        </a>
        and C batteries—are put into general waste. This puts massive amounts of heavy metals and toxins into our landfill sights. The competition has three aspects. Firstly, the team has to identify a waste or recycling issue in the real world, research the problem and then devise a solution. Secondly, they have to work as a team and show a professional attitude to devise real outcomes. Lastly, they have to build a robot that can complete 12 missions in 2½ minutes. The missions are based on the theme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirty-two teams competed in Sydney. Every school was faced with the same set of parameters. The children then have to code the robots and commence the challenge.

        , as they named themselves, performed exceptionally well, finishing in 10th place—an outstanding result, given that the age group they entered was the nine-to-16 year division, and these students are all 10 and 11 year-olds.

        The Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service is an icon of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community. In the lead-up to the Christmas break, they have launched a special new fundraising campaign called Rip it for Rescue. This campaign was created by Casino local Samuel Ivers, a young upcoming rugby player. On 1 August this year, Sam was involved in a serious tackle during a rugby match which left him with possible spinal injuries. He was assisted by the Westpac life saver rescue helicopter and now wants to give back to this vital service that helped him when he was in need. With this in mind, Sam and community leaders, including Mark Sewell, Kris Beavis,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gordon" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Gordon
        </a>
        and Tom Hulse, have offered to 'rip it for rescue', and are calling on their families, friends and the community to donate to this worthy cause. If the rescue service reaches their target of $10,000 by 18 December, Sam and the leaders in the Lismore community will wax or shave their chests. I encourage everyone to get behind this most worthy cause.
