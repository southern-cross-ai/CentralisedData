        must clarify position on #copayment now. Confusion reigns.

        And it does. Our suburban GPs are very much small businesses and they face considerable uncertainty at this time because of the government's incompetence and dissembling. Consider the decisions they have to make. The 24-hour clinics and after-hours clinics that currently do not handle cash. If they have to have cash on premises, will they need new security? Will they have to rethink their entrance? Will they have to rethink their entrance? Will they have to renovate? Will they have to add more physical barriers? What about the safety of their staff? Who takes the cash to the bank? What about the

        &amp;S issues related to that? Will it even be viable to continue to open extended hours? Will they need to take on more staff to take on the role of tax collector? If they suddenly need to take credit cards—and they currently do not—will they need new telecommunications or set up as a credit card merchant? What about the staffing and the training requirements for that? Will they or won't they need to consider these matters? How will the holding of the money on premises affect their insurance premiums? Will they have fewer patients because of a GP tax? Will they need to consider cutting costs elsewhere—yes or no? At this point they just don't know.

        promised no cuts to health. He also promised certainty and to be a government of no surprises. Well, surprise, there is no certainty. The GP tax is reigning confusion on the sector. The government should show the guts of a government and clearly state their position. If they intend to keep pushing, they should say so. They should bring certainty to the sector.
