        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that for many Australian families if the second income earner goes to work for the fourth or fifth day in the week they lose money because of the childcare scheme he designed? How did the Prime Minister rack up $1 trillion of Liberal debt and still not fix his childcare scheme, which holds Australian parents back from working extra days?

        <p>
         The childcare support that we put in place is some $9.2 billion a year. From the time we redesigned the scheme the cost of childcare, according to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Bureau of Statistics
         </a>
         , fell by just over three per cent. The level of labour force participation rose to record levels, and, in particular, labour force participation amongst women was raised to record levels. The gender pay gap fell to record lows. That was the impact of the childcare changes that we put in place. The member asks questions about what it means for Australians who want to go to work for that extra day and earn a bit more money. I'll tell you that the tax plan that we brought into this parliament, that we took to the last election, said to Australians—in particular earning just as much as $45,000 a year—that they would never have to see bracket creep in their lives ever again and that they would pay a rate of tax of no more than 30 cents in every extra dollar they earn. That's what we went to the last election on. That's what was supported by the Australian people.

          <p>
           The point of order is on direct relevance. The question asks about the impact of working a fourth or fifth day on a childcare centre. Both parts of the question refer specifically to that and I ask the Prime Minister be relevant to it.

            Yes, but there was more to the question than just that. I think the Manager of Opposition Business would have a point if it didn't have the political commentary—

            I'm not going to repeat it. Even withstanding that, I think the Prime Minister's in order when he's talking about affordability. But when questions have those taglines on it does open it up. The Prime Minister.

            <p>
             Thank you, Mr Speaker. Under the tax plan that was supported by the Australian people at the last election, which was legislated in this parliament—with much back and forth from the opposition, who were for it and against it and for it and against it—Australians know they can trust the government when it comes to managing the economy. They know they can trust the government. They know that, when we say we want to ensure people keep more of what they earn, we will follow through on that. We legislated that here in this parliament, and Australians know that for every extra dollar they earn they'll get taxed less on it by our government than they would by the Labor Party. That's what they can have confidence about—the more effort they put in the more they'll be able to succeed.
