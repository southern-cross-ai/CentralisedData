        Earlier this month I was honoured to be invited to attend the Good Morning Bangladesh event along with the members for Greenway and Parramatta, the Mayor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blacktown City Council

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Robinson" rel="nofollow">

        , and the state member for Blacktown,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robertson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This year was the 13th year this fundraising morning tea has been held at the Blacktown Village Green. Good Morning Bangladesh has become an important social event for the Sydney Bangladeshi community but it also has a more serious focus. Joining forces with Australia's Biggest Morning Tea, Good Morning Bangladesh raises much needed funds for the Cancer Council's vital research, prevention programs and support services.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were delighted to sample the spread of Bangladeshi food and enjoyed their hospitality, but we also congratulate them on the fact that since 2001 they have raised over $65,000, all directed to assist the Cancer Council. Not only this, they do tremendous work raising money for health care projects back in Bangladesh and are currently raising money to support the construction of a new hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event is organised by the Bangladesh Forum for Community Engagement under the leadership of Dr Abdul Haq. The forum aims to promote understanding amongst the Bangladeshi community members, foster the development of social capital and strong community networking and show their community's commitment to Australia. I would like to congratulate the organisers of the Good Morning Bangladesh event—Dr Abdul Haq, Rafiq Hasan, Ibrahim Mollah, Dr Ayaz Chowdhury, Minie Chowdhury and Shahana Akter—for their drive and commitment to their new home.
