        I rise today to congratulate the Central Coast

        ’s Association on 15 years of service to the community, camaraderie and setting a really wonderful example for the community. Last Sunday I attended their 15-year anniversary. At that anniversary there were 15 foundation members in attendance. The current president is

        is the treasurer.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the 15 years that the Central Coast National Servicemen’s Association has been operating they have raised $55,000, which they have put into the community. It is an organisation that is built on the time that as young men they were forced to leave their jobs and come together to do national service. They had their lives interrupted, but out of that was built this strong bond which developed amongst them. I think it was the strong bond developed at that time that has led to them combining to raise funds for their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first president of the association was Barry Martin. He was president for only a very short period. Then John Carruthers, the current president, took over and was president for 4½ years. Milton Petit followed him. Unfortunately Milton is no longer with us, but he was a great worker in the community. Ron Marlins, who was president for about four years, made an enormous contribution.

        and Laurie Bartlett have also served as president. They have all contributed enormously. They gave money to Wyong Hospital and they regularly give money to the girls and boys of the

       <p>
        I would like to put on record my particular thanks to the National Servicemen’s Association for allowing me to work with them and I thank them very much for the great honour they bestowed on me on Sunday in awarding me life membership of their association. Thank you very much. It gives me great pleasure to share with the House the great work that this group does within the community.
