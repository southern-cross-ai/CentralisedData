        Today I pay tribute to much-loved
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        local sports personality and one of the nicest blokes you could ever meet, Robert Charles Pooley, who passed away unexpectedly last month. He was a dedicated sports fan and coach, and he was highly regarded across Tasmania's cricket and soccer circles.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        from Bob's beloved George Town Cricket Club described him well: 'Bob Pooley will forever be synonymous with the George Town Cricket Club, having led the club for many years with his trademark optimism, drive, commitment and enthusiasm. Bob had a passion for helping others and was always generous with his time and wisdom. His love of cricket and his passion for people made him a valued and respected administrator.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was involved with the NTCA, where he sat on the board for a decade; was committed to the Northern Rangers Football Club; and worked tirelessly in the community across a range of interests. But above all Bob was a family man, and I send my love and condolences to his wonderful wife, Jenny; sons, Rohan and Marshall; and grandchildren, Toby, Harry, Olivia and Mason.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Bob's funeral he was remembered with the Linda Ellis poem
        <i>
         The Dash
        </i>
        , which speaks of the dash between our date of birth and that of our death, saying what matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash. Bob packed so much into the dash between those years. He lived and loved well and will be deeply missed. Vale, Bob Pooley.
