        The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 3 December 2016. It also lists reports for which the House has not received a government response.

       <p class="italic">
        The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response.

        Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are usually reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responses" rel="nofollow">
         Responses
        </a>
        to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within six months of the tabling of a report.

        The attached schedule now includes a table which provides a summary of responses received and responses outstanding for the last four parliaments.

        1 The date of tabling is the date the report was presented to the House of Representatives or to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker
        </a>
        , whichever is earlier. In the case of joint committees, the date shown is the date of first presentation to either the House or the Senate or to the President or Speaker (if presented earlier out of session). Reports published when the House (or Houses) are not sitting are tabled at a later date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2 If the source for the government response date is not the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or the Journals of the Senate, the source is shown in an endnote.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3 For reports up to the end of 42nd Parliament, the time specified is three months from the date of tabling. While the Government has undertaken to continue to respond to reports within three months, from the 43rd Parliament (28 September 2010 onwards) the period within which the House requires a response is six months—see resolution of the House of Representatives of 29 September 2010. This resolution also puts in place additional steps for reports not responded to within that six month period. The period from when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013 and the commencement of the 44th Parliament on 12 November 2013 is not included in the response period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4 A response to this report is no longer expected, as the issues covered in the report are no longer current. This listing will be removed from the next schedule.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5 The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6 Since December 2014 the Government has advised that the need for a response was overtaken by legislation introduced by the previous Government and passed by the previous Parliament. The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        7 On 7 February 2012 the Government provided a statement regarding the reasons for the delay in presenting the response, in accordance with the House resolution of 29 September 2010 on government responses to committee reports. The Government advised that the 37 recommendations required detailed consideration and analysis, and that as an interim response to the report, and to progress the priority measures, the Government intended to introduce legislation in the 2012 Autumn sittings. Since December 2014 the Government has advised that given the passage of time and the change of government, the Government does not intend to respond to the report. The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        8 Since December 2014 the Government has advised that given the passage of time and the change of government, the Government does not intend to respond to the report. The committee still awaits a response to this report.

        9 Since December 2014 the Government has advised that given the passage of time and the change of government, the Government does not intend to respond to the report. The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10 In June 2009 the Government advised that it did not intend to respond formally to this report. In November 2009 the Government indicated a response was being considered and would be tabled in due course. In November 2011 and December 2013 the Government indicated it was in discussion with the committee on this matter. In July 2014 the Government advised that the Independent Contractors Act 2006 was assented to on 1 December 2006 and that the Government's response was covered during debate on the Bill. The committee has not agreed to the removal of this report from the schedule.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        11 On 22 June 2015, during debate on the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015, the Senate noted that the Government has not responded to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications report on its inquiry into information technology pricing. The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        12 On 4 December 2014 the Government provided an interim response to the report, advising that the committee's report is informing the Government's White Paper, which is being prepared.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
         The White Paper
        </a>
        will set out a clear and well defined policy platform for unlocking the full potential of the north, including actions through to 2030. The Government indicated that it will respond to the committee's specific recommendations through the White Paper. On 18 June 2015 the Government released the White Paper on Developing Northern Australia: Our North, Our Future. The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        13 This Report contained a series of recommendations directed at multiple Agencies.

        14 On 14 July 2014 the Government advised the committee that on 25 June 2014 it announced funding for the National
