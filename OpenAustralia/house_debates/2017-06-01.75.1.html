        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister, you and former Treasurer Swan committed $6 million to moving forward the greatest nation building proposal in 50 years:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Gate" rel="nofollow">
         Hell's Gate
        </a>
        . This was destroyed by Shorten Burdekin Hydro, generating a pinprick three hours a day 50 megawatts and a meagre 80 million. Hell's Gate would generate 605 megawatts for 24 hours, 2,400 million in power, ethanol,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
         CO2
        </a>
        -fed algae, beef and sugar. Can the House be assured that the hydro will be overridden and Joyce-Swan will prevail, with CO2 emissions reduced by six million tonne a year—20 times the hydro—a reduction in morbidity of 15 per cent, petrol prices—

         I did not hear it to its conclusion, but I got the general gist of the question. I would like to commend the work of the member for Kennedy, who has been here for nearly a quarter of a century. I know he is a man of great vision. He was also the Minister for Northern Development in the Bjelke-Petersen government—a position he held for quite some time. I remember talking to the member for Kennedy right back in 2000, in the National Party days, and I know the vision and the passion he has for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         . Well may you have that vision, because those in the Labor Party do not and will not stand up for Northern Australia. Member for Kennedy, we have put $2.2 million on the table to fund the feasibility study for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Gate" rel="nofollow">
          Hell's Gate
         </a>
         because of the intrepid work and detail that was put into that by you and the former member for Herbert Ewen Jones.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the current member for Herbert is not really interested in dams in Northern Australia. She is not really interested in dams anywhere. The current member for Herbert is not very interested in the Carmichael mine. But of course what we want to do is pursue—in fact, Member for Kennedy, you would be interested to know that this year we have been accepting applications from state governments for further construction funding. How many dam projects has the Queensland Labor government come through with? None. Zero. Not one.

           In fact, the Labor government wants to gut our dams policy. They want to take money out. They want to remove $232.5 million. They have no vision for this nation. They have no vision for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
            North Queensland
           </a>
           . You know that and I know that—that is why we have to try and move this project along. I am looking for the Labor government to stand up for North Queensland, I really am.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the problem is that when we want to try to deal with these issues we have the member for Grayndler, the shadow minister for infrastructure—but he is not so much a shadow: it's pitch black, it's radio silence; he is like a Cistercian monk, who has come in here with a vow of silence and cannot say boo unless it is an interjection—

           I will take the interjection from the member for Watson, because the member for Watson, the Leader of Opposition Business, should give the member for Grayndler a question. You really should. You should look after your workmates. You should treat him fairly. Be fair at work and give that gentleman a question. You should let that man go to that box and ask a question—but you will not.

           We are going to fight for this dam. I understand how important it is. I have an absolute passion for dams. I have a passion for Rookwood, in the seat of Capricornia; a passion for developing the north; a passion for dealing with water infrastructure; and a passion for

           2. You cannot get much better than that. That is real vision. Inland rail is also our vision. We have vision; they have none. That is the story.
