        Fifty years ago the world watched with bated breath as the

        put three men on the moon. I was just a schoolgirl at the time and I recall, like many others, watching a black-and-white television in a crowded classroom. What we witnessed on that day was the impossible become reality. I was so captivated by the images and the sheer scale of the achievement that I too wanted to be an astronaut. Even then, I thought that women could do anything.

        While I've yet to experience the lofty heights of space that I dreamed of as a young child, I did get to relive some of that magic this past weekend. On Saturday, the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, in my electorate, launched

        , a multi-arts program featuring art exhibitions, discussion panels, film screenings, astronomy nights and workshops on all things lunar. The exhibitions are a collaboration with not only the artists but also the US Consulate. The exhibitions don't just focus on the moon landing but also explore humankind's relationship with the moon. One such exhibition, '

        s. Another exhibition, 'Future', looks at the artworks from the fifties and the sixties and how they imagined the futureâ€”and, no, we don't have jet packs yet. A number of these works remind me of the cover art of the old science fiction novels that I spent most of my childhood lost in.

        It was great to see several generations in attendance for Saturday's launch, including many young faces showing the same fascination and wonder that was shown back on that momentous day in human history in 1969. My congratulations to Craig and the team at

        and everyone involved in putting this program together. For everyone looking for a great afternoon, it's on until 11 September. I encourage everyone to get along and also sample the fare at the Bellbird Cafe, which is sublime to say the least. The powerhouse is a great part of my electorate and it has some absolutely fantastic displays and theatre productions which showcase the multicultural nature of our part of the world. I commend the powerhouse to everyone.
