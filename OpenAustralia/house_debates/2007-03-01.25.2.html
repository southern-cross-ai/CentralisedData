         Committee Act 1969
        </i>
        , the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Lavarack Barracks
        </a>
        redevelopment stage 4, Townsville, Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The facilities at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville have been progressively updated over three development stages. These works are stage 4 of that redevelopment. The principal objectives of this proposal are to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the infrastructure in support of defence capability, to reduce facilities maintenance expenditure on buildings and infrastructure and to address functional and occupational health and safety deficiencies within the existing facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The majority of the facilities to be addressed by this proposal were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s to support training for deployment to Vietnam. These facilities are now substandard and no longer provide the functionality for a modern army. I know the member for Herbert and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence would be strongly in support of this work being carried out, particularly so that the men and women of the Army in that area have the best possible facilities to carry on with their work. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $207.2 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence in late 2007, with completion in mid-2011. I commend the motion to the House.
