       <p>
        I welcome the opportunity to talk today about an outstanding organisation, Probus. In 1976 the first Probus club in Australia was established—the Probus club of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Hunters Hill
        </a>
        . This year marks the 40th anniversary of Probus in Australia. Australian Probus is a part of Probus South Pacific Limited, which has now grown to over 1,900 clubs and 146,000 members. Probus is an association of active members and communities who are predominantly lively retirees. Members share intellectual and cultural interests and participate in social and active lifestyle programs. Probus is an opportunity for people to share great friendships and enjoy fellowship with others within their local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dobell has a large number of retirees. We are very, very lucky because we have a number of outstanding and very active local Probus clubs. We have many retirees who take part in Probus on the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As people retire and their children are busy with their own children and life in general, it can be easy to become disconnected and, sadly, in some cases, lonely, but joining a Probus club makes it possible to be socially connected with a community of like-minded people sharing the same interests at similar stages of their life. As I mentioned, Dobell is lucky to be home to an active and resourceful Probus community, including clubs in

        , Wyong, Tuggerah,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toowoon_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        and

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Wyong's Probus club could very well hold the title for the oldest Probus club on the Central Coast, with their 34-year anniversary celebration coming up. The Wyong Probus club currently has 60 members and is looking to increase its membership by 100 per cent over the coming year. This year, Bateau Bay combined Probus club is celebrating its 10th anniversary, which is really exciting for all of the members. I am looking forward to attending their celebrations in early March and meeting all of the members. Last year I was privileged to address the Forresters Beach Probus Club, giving them an insight into life at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . I am looking forward to addressing the Toowoon Bay Probus Club in April to also talk about federal parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        These clubs have so many activities for their members. Members could easily fill up their social calendars with more than one activity a week, including regular travel, often domestic and international, and activities including monthly dinners, theatre productions, concerts at the
