       <p>
        Today, I call out 'Big Plastic'. I am sure many here have seen the alarming stories of plastic pollution around the globe. Degrading plastic has so extensively polluted oceans around the world that it is now not only killing fish but has entered the human food chain. The most graphic display of this is the Great Pacific garbage patch, which covers, conservatively, 700,000 square kilometres.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my earlier roles in local government I have championed state-wide legislation for container deposit schemes in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , including running locally based trials so we could build the case for state and federal action. It is not rocket science to support a container deposit scheme.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        introduced their legislation 30 years ago, and now the scheme covers cans, plastics, glass bottles and coloured cartons. It has created a major cultural shift in that state, which is now the nation's best recycler.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        scheme supports charities and community groups, with the South Australian scouts earning $9 million per annum through their activities. You never see bottles or cans on the streets of Adelaide. West Australians often notice the difference with the garbage on either side of the border as they drive across the Nullarbor, leaving South Australia and entering Western Australia. South Australians now divert 70 per cent of waste from landfill to recycling, which is much better than the 50 per cent Australian average, and certainly much better than WA's poor 32 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Australians throwing away an estimated seven billion cans and bottles each year, what is stopping us from achieving a better outcome? The answer is 'Big Plastic'. Big plastic is the vested interest of companies like Lion and Coca-Cola Amatil, which actively oppose container deposit schemes by whatever means necessary. One of my staff told me this week that during a trip last year they visited the Washington executives at Coca-Cola Amatil and they asked about the fledgling
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        scheme. She was told by Coke that they would always use any means and any grounds in any court to fight container deposit schemes. So I suggest that we give naming rights to the Great Pacific garbage patch to Coca-Cola.
       </p>
       <p>
        While big plastic oppose container deposit schemes they have found an unlikely ally in Australia in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Australia_Beautiful" rel="nofollow">
         Keep Australia Beautiful
        </a>
        National Association. Keep Australia Beautiful's mission is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A litter free and sustainable Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their objectives are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Given that returning beverage containers for a refund reduces rubbish going to landfill or ending up in the environment, increases recycling rates, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, reduces water use, creates jobs and generates cash for our hip pocket, it is astonishing that Keep Australia Beautiful does not support container deposit schemes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is this so? It is all about the money. In their annual report for 2012-13, Keep Australia Beautiful lists their supporters, and they include the Food and Grocery Council's Packaging Stewardship Forum, Coca-Cola South Pacific and the Coca-Cola Foundation. The same report gives thanks to the generous sponsorship of Coca-Cola for making their beverage container recycling grants possible. Keep Australia Beautiful have been bought out. This is no different to big tobacco propping up their captured agencies, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Public_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Institute of Public Affairs
        </a>
        , or big pharmacy's support for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
         ADHD
        </a>
        drug lobby. In contrast,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia
        </a>
        is actively advocating the introduction of a container deposit scheme, as they understand it will assist in reducing litter and keeping it out of the environment. Keep Australia Beautiful have allowed themselves to be put into a position where they have accepted money to run a grants program that serves the big plastic industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say that Keep Australia Beautiful's WA branch supports a container deposit scheme in Western Australia and across Australia. Under the stewardship of Mel Hayward, Keep Australia Beautiful continues to support the endeavours of all individuals and organisations who are lobbying for this support.
