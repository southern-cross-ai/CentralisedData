        ( This Saturday I have the privilege of attending the 40th anniversary of the Casino Baptist Church Christian Community Preschool. It's a wonderful community-owned and operated preschool that has deep roots within the local community and, in particular, the local Indigenous community. I was recently happy to present the preschool with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Aboriginal
        </a>
        flag, and the school has also recently installed artwork by local Indigenous artist Noel Caldwell. The preschool's director, Anne-Maree Jackson, says it's all about connecting with the Casino community and instilling in the 59 children under their care that sense of community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One remarkable thing about this close-knit preschool is the very low turnover of teachers. They simply don't want to leave. One staff member, Jane Cowan, has been with the school for 30 years. I thank the other teachers: Robyn, Sylvia, Mikala, Sonya, Kirsten, Teressa, Lauren, Judi and Lance. I would also like to acknowledge and thank Anne-Maree and Jane as well as the management committee that is led by chairperson Louise James.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Lady Help of Christians Parish School in South Lismore more is turning 100. The school was inundated by the Lismore flood. The close-knit school community rallied to reopen the school as soon as possible and, at the same time, rescheduled the school's planned 100-year anniversary. The celebrations are now to be held on the first of next month, and I am very much looking forward to attending.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the school was looking forward to marking this milestone, many former students and their families contacted the school to donate memorabilia. The family of former student Mrs Barbara Thacker donated a set of rosary beads worn by her teacher, Sister Clare Noonan. Graham Ahearn kindly made and donated a model of the original church school building, which was built in 1916-17, to show current students what their school originally looked like.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school is constructing a centenary rosary garden to honour the contributions of the Sisters of St Joseph of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart
        </a>
        and parish priests who founded the school. Many members of the community as well as families of former students and teachers have contributed by purchasing a paver to create a path around the garden. The rosary will be inscribed with the names of past parish priests, principals and sisters who were involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the great work the centenary team has done in organising next month's celebration. I thank the parish priest, Father Peter Karam; Principal Brendan Malone; Assistant Principal Katie Rose; and the team of teachers, past teachers, students and parents who generously gave their time. This school has provided faith based education in our community for over 30 years, and I thank all past and present people who have been involved in that.
