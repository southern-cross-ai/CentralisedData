        Health and wellbeing is not something that should be determined by your postcode. The people in Mallee, justifiably, want reliable access to healthcare services but they continue to find it a challenge. Many travel hours to see doctors as many clinics have none, and many must travel to Melbourne or Adelaide for further investigations. The current regional healthcare system in Mallee is broken and many needs are not being met.

        s, nurses and other allied health workers. These wonderful primary healthcare professionals understand the needs of their communities and know the gaps in service. They told me of their frustration with urban-centric policies, which fail to understand the specific needs of rural and regional communities and do not work in the bush. I was impressed by the knowledge, passion and drive exhibited by all who attended.

        We need a responsive and sustainable healthcare delivery which focuses on the unique needs of small populations and large distances. I'm meeting with Mr Hunt this week to discuss the need for structural and systemic change and to advocate for an integrated healthcare model that supports our communities' needs. I will continue later.
