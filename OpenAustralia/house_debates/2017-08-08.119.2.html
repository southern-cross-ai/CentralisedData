        There is an absurdity that lies at the heart of the Turnbull government's

        rollout plan, which means that so far, six years after the start of the National Broadband Network Companies Act, my federal electorate of Perth has only recently undertaken its rollout plan in order to be connected. Well, when I say 'my electorate', in truth only a very, very small parcel has recently received that magical purple shading on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        Co's rollout map, and purple is the golden colour, for want of a better term, in relation to achieving NBN connectivity. Only a very, very small sliver of purple adorns the federal electorate of Perth: a very, very small corner of Bassendean and a small sliver of

        The obscenity is this: I am contacted, as I'm sure all members of this place are, every week—day in, day out—by constituents complaining, quite rightly, about appallingly slow internet speeds. However, what's really interesting in relation to my electorate is that almost none of those complaints really come from Mount Lawley or Bassendean; the complaints come from those hard-working people in Noranda and Bayswater and Morley and Maylands and even
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Perth" rel="nofollow">

        I recently met with Jill Hansen, who is running a wonderful pearl jewellery business in East Perth. The business is going well, but its potential is thwarted; it could be going so much better if she had a meaningful and reliable NBN connection. So much of her business relies on connectivity to manage stock in Australia and overseas, to manage and train staff, to communicate with traders around the world, and yet she cannot get her own phone line. She has to share a line with her neighbour. The only internet connectivity she has is with mobile broadband. Reliability suffers and she is regularly disconnected in the middle of transactions—simple web-based tasks take hours longer than they should, costing Jill's small business valuable time and valuable money. This Prime Minister's 'fraud band', not broadband, is single-handedly holding back this small business from growing and achieving its true potential.

        Take Trent, for example, who recently bought a newly-built apartment in Maylands. He and other owners in his building cannot even get the internet. Telstra has told them that the copper cabling up the street is so degraded it won't even support

        . Telstra won't upgrade it because—wait for it!—'NBN is coming'. Winter is coming,

        is coming, but one thing that is not coming to Maylands is the NBN. The NBN is not coming any time soon, and it's happening on this Prime Minister's watch.

         Well it would be funny, if it wasn't so tragic. We are seeing education outcomes suffering. We are seeing small businesses suffering. We are seeing health outcomes suffering. They are suffering at the hands of this government, this Luddite government that is so slow to catch up to the real world it is leaving us behind at a rate of knots.

         Timothy from Embleton, whose internet speed is a mere 270 kilobytes per second, cannot stream videos and struggles to connect to his network to work from home—that's businesses suffering. He won't get the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         for another 2½ years, if he's lucky. Peter in Maylands hates the idea, quite rightly, of fibre to the node; it is a wasted opportunity. Alan from Bayswater gets one megabit per second. Many of the streets around Alan have been promised fibre to the curb; his address will only get fibre to the node. And Michael lives in a shared house in Morley where things are so grim that he and his housemates have to roster internet usage, otherwise speeds drop to dial-up. This situation is nothing short of absurd. When the Prime Minister was communications minister, his plan was for NBN co to prioritise speed over quality with the greatest need. He has let us down on NBN. He has let us down in marriage equality. He has let everyone down in relation to his government. He is nothing more than a failure.
