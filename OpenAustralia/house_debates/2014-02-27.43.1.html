       <p>
        The outrageous slur by Senator Conroy against Lieutenant General
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
         Angus Campbell
        </a>
        marks a new low in senatorial hearings. General Campbell represents the very best of our military, which he has served loyally and apolitically for 34 years. In a former life, I worked closely with General Campbell, and I have personal knowledge of his great ability, quality and character. I am fortunate to call him my friend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like all of us, Senator Conroy is entitled to his personal views and ambitions, but he is not entitled to use parliamentary privilege to besmirch the reputation of a military officer who has served Australia with such distinction. General Campbell is undertaking a difficult job that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Chief of the Defence Force
        </a>
        selected him to do. He is doing that job with professionalism and diligence. The boats have stopped for 10 weeks now, and General Campbell has made a significant contribution to that most encouraging outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Angus Campbell is in his fourth decade of unbroken service to our nation. He has earned the right to a modicum of respect, particularly from this parliament, in which decency and respect is the anticipated norm. The general would never ask for it, but he does deserve a full and public apology from Mr Conroy. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to stiffen Mr Conroy's spine and to compel or support him to do the right thing: to apologise in full and in a manner that is appropriately contrite and respectful.
