       <p>
        I continue to receive correspondence from people in my electorate and from all around Australia who are appalled at the government's $254-million cut to the ABC. In shattering news for ABC staff and Australian communities, it has been announced today that the cuts will lead to the loss of more than 400 jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Goldstein has welcomed the cuts to the ABC on the basis that the national broadcaster has been a 'protected species' for a long time. He and his colleagues, including—quite hilariously—the member for Sturt, have on the one hand welcomed the cuts and on the other hand are demanding that programs and production facilities and jobs in their states go unaffected—what hypocrisy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all ABC staff for their high-quality work and their passion. I also thank the community and public sector union, including WA regional secretary, Sue Bowers, and her team for their work in galvanising support right around the country. I am glad they are bringing their banners to

         The ABC
        </a>
        should be a protected species because it is an endangered species—especially where this government is concerned. The ABC is a unique provider of the highest quality news and current affairs. It is far and away the most respected news organisation in the country. The Prime Minister said, as plain as day, on the very eve of the election that there would be no cuts to the ABC, yet he has now delivered $254 million in cuts. Children who watch ABC4Kids know that there is a word we use to describe a person who makes a promise and then breaks that promise. The Prime Minister's pants are well and truly on fire.
