       <p>
        I rise in the House today to bring to the attention of the House the poor and failing record of this government when it comes to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        in the southwest of Brisbane. Time and time again we have heard horror stories from local residents across Australia who are suffering at the hands of this Prime Minister and this government. Local residents in Springfield and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_Lakes" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        have had a gutful. I hear it every single day when I am out in the community. The front page of this week's
        <i>
         Springfield News
        </i>
        says it all. People are being stranded and left behind as a result of this Prime Minister's failure to deliver the modern 21st century infrastructure that our community deserves. Time and time again people in business and the education sector have raised with me that they are fed up with this government when it comes to their NBN rollout.

        they were "beyond excited" to get connected, but less than a month later they want their old service back.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since switching to the NBN, their internet is averaging a download speed of four megabytes per second, and is without any connection for about an hour a day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For five days last month they had no internet or phone line at all and were forced to increase their mobile phone data plans just to get by.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not good enough, and this Prime Minister needs to fix this mess.
