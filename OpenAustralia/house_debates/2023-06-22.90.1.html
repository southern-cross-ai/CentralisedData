        My question is to the Prime Minister. As the end of the budget parliamentary sittings approaches, what actions has the Albanese Labor government taken to build stronger foundations for a better future?

         , which is part of the reason why we were able to form government and have a vote for a better future. We've worked every day since May last year to deliver for them. Six weeks ago our Treasurer handed down our second budget, our second budget within the first year of us being in a position to form government. That budget builds a stronger foundation for the better future that we committed to. It was about taking pressure off families while not putting pressure on inflation. It was about helping Australians with real relief right now when they need it, whilst building for the long term. The budget built on the achievements of our first year in office, turning a $78 billion deficit into a $4.2 billion surplus; boosting bulk-billing, with a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive, helping 11 million Australians see a doctor for free; halving medicine costs for more than six million Australians; funding an extra eight Medicare urgent care clinics; investing in a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers; providing $3 billion between us and states and territories on energy-bill relief; increasing JobSeeker; increasing rent assistance; increasing the single-parent payment.

         During all of that, those opposite have said no to absolutely everything. They're defined by what they're against, defined by their negativity, and we see it in the way that they approach question time, where last week they spent it going up a dry gully, and this week they've done the same thing. In less than 10 days, on 1 July, another one of our commitments will become a reality, cheaper child care. Medicare urgent care clinics will start opening. The National Anti-Corruption Commission will start. Our reformed Safeguard Mechanism will come into force. The energy incentive for small business will take effect, and the extra $2 billion for social housing will start running as well. We'll keep on with the job, while those opposite just keep saying no to everything.
