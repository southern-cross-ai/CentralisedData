        On Saturday 4 February I went down to the gurdwara in Revesby, and it was great see everyone in the Sikh community in the temple. One of the really good things about the event on Saturday was we learned about the founding of the gurdwara back in 1976. It was actually the first Sikh gurdwara in Sydney. We met many of the trustees who established the gurdwara who were incredibly visionary in what they did. It was a terrific day. It was also great to be able to present awards to the kids from the Punjabi school which is affiliated with the gurdwara. I want to thank

        , Terry Sidhu and all the teachers and in particular the trustees who had the vision back in the 1970s to establish what has become such a central part of the Sydney community.

        Carlton South Public School celebrated its centenary last year. It's a fantastic school, and it was good to catch up recently with Jade Toofohe, the president of the P&amp;C. The P&amp;C has a lot of plans for this year coming off the strength of that great centenary year. There are a number of proposals for various building works and other activities. It was also good to hear about the P&amp;C's strong focus on mental health and on supporting families with kids who are going through mental health issues. It's a terrific school, very well-led by Principal Darren Galea, and it was terrific to catch up with Jade at Carlton South Public School recently.
