         I thank the member for his question. Members of the House may be interested to know that there's an important pattern of evidence emerging from the royal commission into robodebt, in that the previous government and its various ministers were frequently, repeatedly and numerously warned over an extended period of years of problems with the robodebt scheme, yet the unlawful, illegal scheme continued.

           Mr Speaker, I've raised with you, on a number of occasions, the danger that the conduct of the Minister for Government Services, in repeatedly reporting on the proceedings of the royal commission, is doing in terms of the overall status of the royal commission. I've referred particularly to Speaker Snedden's ruling that it raises the real threat of influencing the commission, and I make this further point, which is that the damage is greater with each successive time that this minister offends against the well-established protocols of this House.

               The member for Moreton is warned. When I'm about to give a ruling is definitely not the time to interject. In relation to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                Royal Commission
               </a>
               into the Robodebt Scheme, my approach has been to allow evidence to the commission which has been publicly reported to be referred to in the House. But what I am less comfortable with is putting a construction on the evidence or the drawing of conclusions about the conduct of individuals who are parties to the proceedings. I therefore ask all members, including the minister, to refrain from doing this when speaking about this royal commission in the House.

                There were protests from robodebt victims directly to the member for Aston's office. In addition, a literature search reveals literally tens of thousands of articles in the media. It's been revealed in the commission that the minister investigated the personal files of 52 complainants, but not the actual complaints about the legality of the robodebt scheme. There were 19,780 internal reviews by people within the system complaining about robodebt. There were 4,339 external reviews to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
                 AAT
                </a>
                related to robodebt. There was an ongoing campaign, which was recorded by the then opposition in the parliament, and other parties in the media. There was exhibit 4775, the missing $1 million PricewaterhouseCoopers commissioned report. Even a ParlInfo search reveals 713 mentions of robodebt in
                <i>
                 Hansard
                </i>
                between 7 February 2017 and 12 November 2020. Australians listening to this question time will be justifiably perplexed and outraged as to why these warnings failed to have the scheme stopped. Perhaps one answer is that the four coalition ministers who've appeared have said, on no fewer than 140 occasions between them, 'I don't recall,' or some variation of that. When the ministers don't recall what was happening, what chance do the robo-victims have?
