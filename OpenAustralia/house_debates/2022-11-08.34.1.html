       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to the Redland Community Centre's Homeless United program and those who are working tirelessly to ensure the success of this initiative despite significant obstacles. The design of the program supports our homeless, from both a psychological and a physical perspective. Since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HU" rel="nofollow">
         HU
        </a>
        program commenced, 323 people have been through their care, with 206 successfully housed by the HU team and another 43 assisted and supported in paid employment. Collaboration with the Queensland department of housing has seen a further 117 housed.
       </p>
       <p>
        This program was fortunate enough to receive 22 months of state government funding. However, this funding was taken away at the end of 2021. But where the state government has walked away, the Redlands community has rallied to the cause. My city's real estate fraternity, led by the incomparable Louise Denisenko, has held two remarkably successful fundraising dinners to keep the program serving our community. Last year's 'There's no place like home' dinner raised $26,000 for the program. This year, the dinner raised almost $33,000. My wife and I were privileged to be there to witness this outpouring of generous support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The highlight of this year's dinner was seeing HU program leader, Horowai Rameka, serenade the organising committee at the end of the evening. I want to thank Louise and her committee, and all involved in—and all those who sponsored—this amazing event. Thank you for all you're doing for our community.
