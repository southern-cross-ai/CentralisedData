       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute today to a very sick friend, Kenneth John Alcorn, known very widely around Ballajura and the north-eastern suburbs of Perth as Scottie Alcorn. As secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch in Ballajura, he is a real identity, a real icon in the local community. He was a tireless worker behind the scenes, orchestrating the development of the Ballajura War Memorial and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Peace Park
        </a>
        . He was the main organiser of Anzac Day dawn services in Ballajura for many years. He was always distinguished by the way he used to wear the garter blue jacket, being a former member of the 1st Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        . Apparently he was in the Q store in those days. Following his discharge, he moved back to Perth. He has also been a strong supporter of the police cadets at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballajura_Community_College" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , where the war memorial is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, on his way to Anzac Day, he was on one of those cruise ships and ended up having two strokes and has been desperately ill. He spent several weeks in hospital in Istanbul and was medevaced back to Australia. We are greatly concerned about his health. I hope that he can pull through and return to be amongst his mates. Best regards to Scottie. Our thoughts are certainly with him and Molly.
