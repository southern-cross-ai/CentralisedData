        I rise to congratulate the Banks community on the recent Anzac Day commemorations. Anzac Day reminds us of the sacrifices made by so many Australians on our behalf. Those of us who have not experienced war can never truly understand what they endured for us, but we must always remember their service. I had the privilege to spend time and commemorate this critical day with local residents and members of the veterans community. In the week before Anzac Day I joined the community at Oatley Memorial Gardens, where a moving Anzac memorial service took place. I must commend and thank the President of the Oatley

        Sub–Branch, Mr Michael Tiddy, and the branch secretary, Mr Ian Thompson, for organising the service. I know that the branch is already planning for Anzac Day 2015, which will be a very special year, commemorating, as it does, the centenary of Anzac.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, Mortdale RSL Sub-Branch hosted the joint service at Mortdale Remembrance Park—a joint service of Mortdale, Penshurst and Oatley sub-branches. More than 800 local residents braved the early morning rain to pay their respects. It was particularly great to see a strong showing of families, including young children. It was also tremendous to see representatives of local scout groups,

        branches and schools lay wreaths. The Riverwood squadron of the

        provided the catafalque party and represented the squadron well. Thank you to Mr John Delaney, president of the sub-branch, and to his entire committee, including Mr Reg Miller and Mr Peter Dufty, for hosting such a wonderful commemoration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to Anzac Day, Mortdale RSL also held a smoko at Mortdale RSL Club. It was a well-attended function and I again commend the sub-branch on their organisation of it. I also attended an Anzac remembrance service at Christ Church Mortdale, organised by the church and Mortdale RSL Sub-Branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Penshurst RSL Sub-Branch hosted a smoko, which drew a great crowd and was a fitting commemoration. I was particularly impressed by the cartoons, dating back to the 1920s, drawn by a local RSL member, which were on display throughout the event. Mr John Hoban, president of the sub-branch, and his committee, including Mr Kevin Kelly, Mr Ken Riley, Mr Graham Grant and Mr John Lloyd did a tremendous job organising this event.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Riverwood, I attended the legion sub-branch Anzac Day service. President Dick Matthews leads a strong sub-branch that is particularly well connected to the community. This was evident on Anzac Day, with a great turnout and involvement from many local schools. I thank Mr Mathews and his committee for hosting this service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anzac Day is a very special time, and I was very honoured to join with our local community to commemorate the services of our armed forces at these events.
