        As members would be aware, the Prime Minister will be absent from question time, as she grieves with her family the loss of her father, someone she absolutely adored. At this stage she will be absent from parliament for the week. I know that all members and indeed all Australians join me in passing on their sympathies to the Prime Minister, her mum and her sister at this time of terrible sadness. I also want to note some of the fine sentiments that have been expressed from people across the House over the past couple of days and over the weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was reminded very much of the Prime Minister and her dad when John and Moira
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillard" rel="nofollow">

        travelled to Brisbane in 2010 to be there when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        rehearsed her campaign launch speech. They travelled literally thousands of kilometres to be there on the day—a very important day for their daughter. Just as the rehearsal was finishing up and the room went dark and the music started blaring out there was this big '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Happy Birthday
        </a>
        ' emblazoned right across the screens in the hall. This was all for John's birthday and everybody sang
        <i>
         Happy Birthday
        </i>
        . After that, Julia and her dad had a hug in the corner. When the music was finished there was not a dry eye in the house. That demonstrated to me how close they were.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Gillard was a man of humble beginnings who sought to give his daughters the best possible education opportunities—the education opportunities that he did not have himself. He instilled in his daughters a love of learning, a commitment to the value of fairness and certainly the importance of looking after those in need. As someone who has worked closely with the Prime Minister over many years, I have seen those values in everything that she does—especially in her drive to ensure that every child has the opportunity to have a good education and to reach their full potential regardless of their background. Many in this chamber would also be aware that John Gillard also instilled in his daughter a love of political debate, and I am sure there are some opposite who wish he had not done that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of all, John Gillard's story speaks volumes for all that is great and good about our country. He was a migrant who worked hard, often at two jobs, to give his children the very best opportunities in life—and he did live to see his daughter become our nation's first female PM. He was very proud of his daughter every single day, as I know she was of him. Our thoughts are with Julia, her mum and her sister at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will answer questions on behalf of the PM during question time. I also present for the information of honourable members an updated ministry list dated 7 September 2012.

         On indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to express on behalf of the coalition our condolences to the Prime Minister and her family on the death of her father, John. Losing a parent is a heavy blow, and the Prime Minister was obviously particularly close to her father. Yes, John

          Gillard
         </a>
         came to Australia as a migrant from Wales, he did work hard and he did realise the Australian dream—to see his children do better than he could probably ever have imagined when he stepped off his transport from the United Kingdom. To have your child become prime minister of your country is perhaps the proudest thing that any parent can achieve. He was a fine Australian and obviously a very proud dad.
