        As the 45th Parliament draws to a conclusion, I want to put on the record the record funding that has poured into the Lyne electorate over this 45th Parliament for roads and bridges; aged care—residential and home care; communication rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        and mobile phone black spots; apprenticeships and training incentives; and record funding to all schools, both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government schools and independent schools. There has been record funding for New South Wales government hospitals in Taree, Wauchope,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        and Maitland, and also massive increases in funding of aged care.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I assumed responsibility for caring for the Lyne electorate, aged-care funding was only $90 million a year—and we have one of the oldest and most ageing demographics in the nation. That funding is now above $135 million annually. We've got capital works extensions occurring in Forster at Pacific Cape, a massive 144-bed complex. There are also grants of $8 million for expansion to Bundaleer in Wauchope; in Taree; in Largs; for Banyula Village in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bar" rel="nofollow">
         Old Bar
        </a>
        ; at Bushland Health seniors' living complex in Taree; in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks_Nest" rel="nofollow">
         Hawks Nest
        </a>
        ; and we have just turned the sod on a brand-new nursing home and seniors complex in Gloucester.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other day, I had the honour of announcing $8½ million for Bushland Health to start work on their $28 million vertical seniors' living complex on the banks of the mighty
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_River" rel="nofollow">
         Manning River
        </a>
        . This grant will fund public infrastructure which will allow this development to go ahead. Bushland Health's seniors living complex is the first cab out of the rank. There is a master plan for a $455 million residential, commercial and public space development which will be catalysed by this investment. There will be 180 jobs in the Bushland Health projects alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Forster civic precinct commenced work some months ago, and I was very pleased to be there at the official sod-turning. A new library, public space, retail and community spaces in Forster will result. This is a massive growth in aged care across the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        In roads, we've just announced $20 million for Clarence Town Road in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungog_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Dungog Shire
        </a>
        . As well as the $5 million in heavy vehicle and safety productivity program for The Bucketts Way, we have just announced another $20 million for The Bucketts Way. And we've delivered 40 apprenticeships in the wage subsidy trial across the Lyne electorate.
