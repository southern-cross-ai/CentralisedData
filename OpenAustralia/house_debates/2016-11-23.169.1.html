        This year marks the 125th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belair_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Belair National Park
        </a>
        . I would like to thank all the dedicated volunteers who give their time to care for what is a really wonderful natural and historical resource in my electorate. The park is nestled in the start of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lofty_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Lofty Ranges
        </a>
        , and it is the second-oldest national park in Australia. It attracts 250,000 visitors a year. It was created in 1891, when the state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        was only 55 years old. It is also the sixth-oldest national park in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success of Belair National Park is testament to its value to the community. More than just a protected green space, it has great public utility and is saturated with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        history dating right back to 1837, which is only a year after our state proclamation. The park is complete with ovals, pavilions, tennis courts, barbecues and picnic areas and is a hive of activity for families on the weekends. For those who wish to explore the park's natural beauty, there are a variety of trails suitable for all, from novice walkers up to veteran hikers. While keeping fit and healthy, walkers can marvel at the waterfalls along the aptly named Echo Track to the north, or make their way south along

        up to Amphitheatre Rock. For lovers of history and politics like myself, Belair National Park is also home to the summer residence of former South Australian governors. The residence is a magnificent Victorian mansion which boasts the state's first indoor swimming pool, which is quite a sight to see. I was there to see it myself in early March, which was the launch of the park's birthday celebrations. For a gold-coin donation, the Friends of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Government_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Government House
        </a>
        happily conduct tours of this wonderful historical site for tourists and the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Friends of Old Government House is just one of the many community groups who devote their time to maintaining the Belair National Park, which covers 835 hectares in total. The Friends of Belair National Park is another one of these volunteer groups involved with the park. They are a committed group that I have had the pleasure of being a member of, and they do a huge amount of work, from weeding and bushland protection to hosting visitors and taking tours of the park, and letting people know about the wonderful flora and fauna that we have. We in Adelaide are lucky to have such a space only 13 kilometres from the city centre. It is right on our doorstep. In this, the 125th year of Belair National Park, I pay tribute to all of those who make the park the wonderful place that it is, and I encourage all South Australians and visitors to South Australia to visit the park on 3 December for the end of the 125th birthday celebrations. I cannot commend it highly enough.
