        I'm testing my rates of recovery here, I have to say! Jetstar flights have started from Melbourne to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Hervey Bay
        </a>
        , in my electorate. What an incredible opportunity. The first flight touched down in Hervey Bay on Thursday last week. It's scheduled three times a week. The service will provide more than 1,100 seats each week between Melbourne and Hervey Bay. What a boost to tourism, what an opportunity for economic growth on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Coast
        </a>
        and what a great opportunity for the people of Melbourne. Come up and have some Hervey Bay sea scallops and ocean king prawns or visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Island
        </a>
        , which is in the member for Wide Bay's electorate but is still a good thing to see. We have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundaberg_Rum" rel="nofollow">
         Bundaberg Rum
        </a>
        up to the north. Kalki Moon, for example, is an award-winning gin out of Bundaberg. There are a world of opportunities, so I'd encourage everyone from Melbourne to get on that flight three times a week and come to Queensland. Many Victorian people already live in Queensland. It makes no difference if you want to visit any of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also had the opportunity to visit Pronto Modular, which is a construction firm in Bundaberg that is making affordable modular homes. It's a local business with local builders. They are constructing these in a dedicated offsite facility. It's not impacted by the weather. They use local trades and local opportunities. Thanks to Matt and Kyle for showing me around. Would you believe they also own Favours Coffee? What a combination—construction and coffee. It sounds like a wonderful combination to me. They just celebrated the second year in business for Favours Coffee.

        Etex is a plasterboard manufacturing plant at the Bundaberg port, which opened in 2017. I know the member for Moreton won't believe this, but it's off the back of a decision by the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">

        government to deliver a gas pipeline to the Bundaberg port, without which this facility could not proceed. We did have to fight and argue again when there was a change in government, but the gas pipeline was delivered. As a result more than 40 people are employed in a very important part of the construction industry, which is delivering plasterboard right around Queensland. Thanks to Justin and Katrina for showing me through the factory and explaining the ins and out of plasterboard manufacturing, which I've got to say, as an engineer, is fascinating. It's actually quite complex. It looks simple but it's very, very complicated. You have to turn things out to very, very fine measurements. It takes a lot of work and a lot technical expertise. Congratulations to them. It's been very helpful.

        Finally, to local sporting champions: 54 young athletes in the Hinkler region have received a funding boost to help them compete at state, national and international sporting competitions. They include five sets of siblings and four local para champions, who were also successful in round 4. Surf lifesaving,

        , basketball, netball, volleyball and cycling—it's all there. There's an opportunity coming up: round 1 for 2024-25 is now open, and applications close on 31 July 2024.
