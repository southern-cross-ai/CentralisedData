        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the steps the government is taking to ensure that residents seeking to become Australian citizens share our values of freedom, equality and mutual respect, including in my electorate of Bonner?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. We are the most successful multicultural society in the world. It is a remarkable achievement, of which every Australian can be proud. It has been built on an orderly and stable migration program over many years and over generations. We have seen what happens in other countries where migration is not controlled.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Europe" rel="nofollow">
          In Europe
         </a>
         we have seen, literally, existential threats to nation states—to their political stability and to their harmony. We have seen uncontrolled and irregular migration flows threaten the very existence of nations in the world today.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have restored the integrity of our borders. There has not been a successful people-smuggling operation seeking to come to Australia for over 1,000 days. We have a migration program that has the people's confidence, because they know that their government, and their government alone, determine who comes to Australia. What unites us as Australians is our commitment to shared values: democracy, freedom, the rule of law, mutual respect and equal rights for men and women—fundamental Australian values which are acceptable to everybody, regardless of their religion and regardless of their ethnic background. We should be reinforcing that, and we make no apologies for ensuring that those who seek to join our Australian family are committed to the values that define us and which unite us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier today, the minister introduced legislation to put Australian values at the heart of our citizenship process. It is something that should be welcomed by everyone in this chamber, yet the opposition has failed to support this principle. They are unable to support strengthened English language requirements. I heard the member for Watson criticising that on the radio this morning. They are unable to support the need to demonstrate integration into the Australian community. They are unable to support a requirement to commit to our values and pledge allegiance to Australia. The Labor Party has failed to learn from its mistakes. They are divided on the need for strong borders and on the need for an orderly immigration system. Ten Labor members and senators have publicly questioned the need for our citizenship changes, while the member for Watson—a former immigration minister, no less—has again questioned whether a strong immigration and citizenship policy is important for security. Nothing is more important to secure our future than maintaining our successful multicultural nation, united by a commitment to our Australian values.
