        The 1st of December is National Water Safety Day, and it's an appropriate day to recognise the bravery of

        brothers Ryan and Oscar. Last summer, Ryan and Oscar rescued three girls who were in trouble in the water at the beach. They say they were in the right place at the right time, but they risked their own safety to bring these three girls safely back to the sand, and they rightly received a life-saving award for their brave efforts.

        have asked us to support National Water Safety Day and to get this message out. Here's what you can do to be safe in the water: swim at supervised locations and between the red and yellow flags at patrolled beaches; wear a life jacket when boating and fishing; avoid alcohol and drugs in and around the water, possibly all the time; and supervise children at all times around water.

        They're simple messages that one would think most of us in Australia have grown up with, but there are too many people who don't know those messages. Please share these messages. Get them out. We're about to enjoy a summer with some freedoms we have not had for a while. Let's make it a safe and happy summer. I very much look forward to coming down to the Frankston Life Saving Club and the Seaford Life Saving Club, getting out with the nippers and being part of teaching people how to be safe in the water.
