        We all have a range of wonderful events across our communities, and one of the terrific events that was reinstated to the Beenleigh and district community back in 2021 was the annual Beenleigh Cane Parade and the Beenleigh Cane Gala Ball. These events are a celebration of the history of the Beenleigh region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saturday week ago, we saw the Beenleigh Cane Parade, with over 50 floats, showcasing the wonderful community organisations, businesses and other opportunities that exist across our community of Beenleigh and in the surrounding areas. Importantly, it was celebrating 150 years of the history of sugarcane, which was a foundation of the economy for so long and still is today in many parts of our local community. I take this opportunity to thank the Beenleigh Rotary Club and its president, Janee Hong, who is here in the chamber this afternoon along with her husband, Allan, for the terrific work they do each and every year to make the cane festival parade such a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday night, we also had the opportunity to celebrate at the Beenleigh Cane Gala Ball, which was a terrific time to celebrate. Importantly, both events raised money for the Mini Farm project at Loganlea State High School which provides much needed food for those in need right across our community. Thank you to all involved.
