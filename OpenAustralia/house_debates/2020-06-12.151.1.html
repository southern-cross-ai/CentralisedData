        Over the June long weekend, members of the Reid electorate were acknowledged through the announcement of the

         Queen's Birthday

        honours list. It was an opportunity to recognise the great work of those in our community and country who contribute in exceptional ways.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some recipients have made their mark in the sporting arena and beyond. Ms Bess Rosen received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>

        women's hockey association. Over the last 40 years, she has volunteered significantly for the community, not only through the work in women's sports but also for Meals on Wheels and Abbotsford Cove Community Association, to name but a few. Mr Michael John Bailey was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia for his service to rugby league and to the community. He is on the board for Wests Ashfield Leagues, and in 2011 he was elected to chairman of the Reid local

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In the arts and creative industries, Mr Raymond Peter Burgess has been acknowledged for service to the entertainment industry, while Mr Keith Mervyn Cowen has been recognised for service to the arts administration. Both have been awarded the

        </a>
        for their contribution to our nation's creative industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the world of politics, Mr Paul John Zammit, who is no stranger to this place, was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to parliaments in Australia and New South Wales. In his time in public office, Mr Zammit was the member for Lowe, which is now the current seat of Reid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Military awards have been presented to two worthy constituents who have displayed outstanding service. The Medal of the Order of Australia has been given to Chief Petty Officer Brady Gary Walsh for meritorious performance of duty in the field of Navy training, and Leading Seaman Patrick Georgen Palmer has been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Conspicuous Service Medal
        </a>
        for meritorious achievement of duty in the field of Navy information and communications technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am so proud of my constituents who have made a wonderful contribution not only to our community but to our country, and that they've been recognised through the Queen's Birthday honours list. Their awards are very well deserved.
