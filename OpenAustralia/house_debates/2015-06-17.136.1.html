       <p>
        Having been born and bred in the Barton electorate, one of New South Wales' most culturally diverse regions, I am extremely proud of our new citizens who have chosen Australia as their new home. As a first generation Australian of Greek heritage, I am passionate about our culturally diverse society and understand firsthand the journeys that migrants take and the paths they forge in their new country. As Australians, we all participate and share in this wonderful nation together. As a modern Federation, our rich social fabric is interwoven with various strands of cultural narratives, including defeating extraordinary adversity for the chance of a better life.
       </p>
       <p>
        For these 507 individuals, receiving their Australian citizenship is a most auspicious event signifying hope and opportunity. For many, it is also an emotional journey in a foreign land—now they have been welcomed to be a part of a proud nation that is multicultural—offering them a new beginning. It has a strong legacy left by previous generations of Australians who have made our country what it is and the people we are today.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year is the 66th anniversary of Australian citizenship. More than 4½ billion people have pledged their commitment to Australia and its people over the years. There is no doubt that the strength of our modern society, and Australia as a nation, lies in the diversity of its people and the cohesion of ethnic, religious and cultural differences. But our greatest asset is our collective adherence to democratic values and that is the defining hallmark of Australian life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite recent domestic and international threats to security and an assault on our national identity, Australia remains incredibly tolerant. This is because the heart of our nation is peaceful and harmonious. What I frequently witness in my electorate of Barton and elsewhere in Australia is the mutual respect we have towards one another. We are an egalitarian nation that displays dignity and respect towards fellow individuals. The success of Australia is credited to the efforts, hardship and persistence of our forebears. We are all united by love of country, our strong family values and the want of opportunity and reward. By becoming an Australian citizen, we pledge our commitment to our state and to bettering our society. As the federal member for Barton, I am proud to present at these citizenship ceremonies. These new citizens have much to look forward to, and I wish them all the best in their new beginnings.
