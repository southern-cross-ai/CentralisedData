        Mr Deputy Speaker, are you okay? Today is national R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ? Day, a conversation starter that takes place to ensure that mental health for everyone is getting a check-up.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 19 September, I am looking forward to going to Samuel Terry Public School and celebrating R U OK? Day with that school. Natalie
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        , a mother of four who has students at that school, is passionate about her kids' education and their wellbeing. Natalie lost her best friend to suicide last year, and four months later lost another close friend to the same tragedy. They both had young children, and their children all attend Samuel Terry Public School in Cranebrook. Now that school will host its very first R U OK? Day on 19 September.
       </p>
       <p>
        I applaud Natalie and the school for taking great action on such an important initiative. That day will be all about teaching kids how to ask anyone and everybody if they are okay. It is a proud school that is very antibullying, so they are announcing that it's time to let all kids know that bullying is out and that asking if you are okay is in.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seven Australians take their own lives every day. It is painful for all left behind, who are left wondering why and 'what if?'. But if we start with, 'Are you okay?' we can at least open up the conversation and act. Out of a very sad story, Celeste Cannell has written a children's book,
        <i>
         Emily and the VERY Big Feeling
        </i>
        . This book was written in honour of Celeste's best friend's 16-year-old daughter, Emily Brady, after she was lost, tragically, to suicide in 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend all members in this House to order the book so it can be published. I am proud to support the author of
        <i>
         Emily and the VERY Big Feeling
        </i>
        , and will be providing a book launch in my electorate. Mr Speaker: are you okay?
