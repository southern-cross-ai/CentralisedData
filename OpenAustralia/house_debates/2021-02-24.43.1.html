       <p>
        Early last year, a gentleman by the name of Raj Udawatta came to see me in my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        office. Raj told me how he had been here since 2013, having come from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lanka
        </a>
        , and was working on a 457 visa as a mechanic. He told me about his family—his wife, Florence, and their four kids—and their schooling, their sports and how they had integrated into the Kempsey community. He also told me that he had terminal cancer and that he feared that, if he passed away, his family would be sent back, as they were dependants on his visa.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Raj passed away in September of last year, and his family are now fighting through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        . I have told them, as I've told the Kempsey community, that I will do everything in my power to ensure that these people stay here. They are the fabric of the Kempsey community. They are good people. They are not asking for a handout; they're asking for a fair go.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've spoken to the newly appointed minister for immigration and had very positive discussions with him. I will wait for the determination of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
         AAT
        </a>
        . In the event that they require my assistance, I will do everything I can. We are a compassionate nation, and compassion is what the Udawatta family need right now.
