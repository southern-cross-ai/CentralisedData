        <p>
         on indulgence—Just in response to what the Prime Minister just raised: it sounds like video presence won't be used by ministers during question time. I respect that for today this has been organised and the moment will have gone, but, unless someone is unwell or prohibited from being able to participate, ministers should be available for questions. We have video presence available. There will be some who, because of the lockdown rules, are unable to go to their electorate office, and that is respected. But it sounds like, from what the Prime Minister has described, that even those ministers who would be able to get to their electorate office for video presence will not be available for question time for the remainder of the week.

          I can't really make any comment on that. As I said, video presence is available and the requirement is that members are trained, and that they do so from their electorate offices—as we know, without me going over all that again. For the circumstances of individual ministers and their attendance, that's not a matter for me; that is a matter for the Prime Minister.
