       <p>
        Earlier this week my Gladstone office was picketed by trade unions protesting the China free trade agreement. They claimed it will cost Australian jobs. They claimed it will lead to an overflow of Chinese immigrants. But they are wrong and they are definitely barking up the wrong tree with these ridiculous claims.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to be clear when I say that the China free trade agreement is not intended to threaten Australian jobs. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        is intended to boost jobs and opportunities for Australians. We want to encourage investment to help industry. It is important that we improve the trade relationship between Australia and China. China is one of our biggest trading partners.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also encourage investment in Australia and reduce tariffs on industries that includes tourism, agriculture and the energy and resources sector. Australia has eight other free trade agreements in place, which all have similar provisions to the Chinese-Australian agreement, and there are still jobs for Australians, and plenty of jobs in most cases. Since the coalition has been in government there has been a 20 per cent decrease in the rate of V-457s being issuedâ€”yes, 20 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not the first attack they have launched and I am sure it will not be the last. But we plan to counter their attacks with the truth. The FTA will not reduce immigration safeguards. It will not permit overseas workers from working in Australia below any standard that we have already set. It will not put Australians out of work. We are not changing the required skill levels for Chinese visa holders to work in Australia. We are streamlining and improving access to skill assessments. We have been clear on our position from the start, but what is Labor's position? The Leader of the Opposition spoke in favour of the free trade agreements with the Chinese premier. What is his stand now? What are they telling the unions? We want to know where the opposition stands on free trade agreements with China or anyone else. They have not clearly stated their policy and I would like to hear that. The silence from the Labor Party has been deafening on this. Come out and be heard.
