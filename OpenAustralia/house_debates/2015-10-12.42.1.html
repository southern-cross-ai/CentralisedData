        Mr Speaker, as you know, we are approaching that time of year when senior students graduate from our local high schools. Honourable members will agree that these are proud and happy occasions. I try to get to as many as I can, but sometimes responsibilities in this chamber prevent that from happening. Unfortunately this year that will be the case for one of my favourite schoolsâ€”the Logan City Special School. I told them I could not be there but that I would give them a big wrap here in the people's house of the Australian parliament.

        There is Rheece Clenton, a school captain who is really into building and drawing. Nathan Travers, another captain, is really enthusiastic about work experience and is a nature lover. Everybody likes Bailey Machado, who is right into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        dramas but balances that with a great work ethic. Sean Hope, sports captain, is a very energetic and charismatic young man who loves to dance and sing, and he is a bit of a revhead in that he likes his V8s as well. Jeremy Willis, wellness captain, is in charge of making people in class laugh and feel good about themselves. It is really great to see that Michael Peyton likes his library time and selecting his own books.

        To all of these students: we are so proud of you. Congratulations on graduating this year, and make sure you thank Jesse Best and all the other great teachers at Logan City Special School, as well as your parents and carers, for all they have done to help you along the way.
