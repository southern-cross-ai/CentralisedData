       <p>
        Over the last couple of weeks, I've been visiting local high schools in Tangney to meet with some of my electorate's brightest students in year 11 and 12 politics and law classes. It's been really enjoyable sharing my journey, answering questions and hearing their ideas. Thank you to the

        year 12s, the Melville Senior High Year School year 11s and year 12s and the Kennedy Baptist College year 12s for letting me share with you my experience and receive your views. It was a really interesting time catching up with these switched on

        students. We had some great conversations.

       <p>
        I want to particularly congratulate the Melville Senior High School students and their principal, Phillip White, staff and parents for their second consecutive finalist placement in the WA Secondary School of the Year award. The school is now placed in the top 10 public schools in WA for ATAR results, which is a massive achievement. The school has so much to offer, including an aviation studies program with two full-motion flight simulators, the only program to offer this in WA.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish every student the very best as they head back to their mock exams very soon and on to complete their ATARs. Good luck as well if you're moving on to the workforce. With your hard work and the support of your teachers and families, I am sure that you will achieve your full potential. Good luck to all of the students in Tangney, and thank you to their teachers and their parents for their support.
