        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the Morrison-Joyce government is investing in nation-building infrastructure which is creating jobs and driving growth in regional Australia? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of alternative approaches?

         I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question. It was great to be in Gladstone the other day discussing with the member for Flynn key proponents on how we drive the Inland Rail from Toowoomba through to Gladstone—we know how important that is—and working with Colin Boyce, who's the candidate there. I'm sure that he will do a great job. So often we hear the sneers from the other side about the member for Flynn, but we acknowledge that he is a person who's been in business, who's stood behind his own chequebook and who's risked his own money. That is a great recommendation so people can understand why the Inland Rail is so very, very important. We are now driving the Inland Rail so that you can go from Melbourne to Narromine. We have 37 kilometres still to do at Stockinbingal. This is a mechanism that shows delivery. This is something that we actually believe in. The best quote we got from the Labor Party was that it was a nice idea. For us it's not a nice idea; it's a reality. It's a reality that we are delivering.

              You can keep talking but your microphone is off. I would make two points. The Deputy Prime Minister was asked about alternative approaches, not to give a character assessment. So he needs to stick to the policy. For those members who were

              </a>
              , I shouldn't have to repeat myself but I will briefly. You will be ejected. There are a lot of members that can't be here and many that are here have gone to great lengths to be here, but if you interject you will be ejected. For those who are

                 One of the big purposes of the Inland Rail is the movement of bulk commodities, and one of the bulk commodities is coal. That's something that the member for Grayndler and that split party which is called the Labor Party—the left and the right—will never ever be able to deliver on. He is a person who does not believe in his own—
