        After the Queensland budget last week, Redlands are the forgotten people. We're watching our state debt tick up to $83 billion and we're hearing promises of more bus and boat stops, but, in reality, Queensland Labor is delivering nothing to my city. We are at the point now where they announced the cleaning of drains as a deliverable, as well as artificial grass to a bowls club, or they find an

        member somewhere on a sports club executive and promise them half a clubhouse in a location where you can't even build a clubhouse. This is complete confusion.

        There are major arterials in my neck of the woods that need upgrading to four lanes, but, of course, we get no work done on those. When the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        offered to duplicate roads, like Cleveland Redland Bay Road and the Shaw Street roundabout, the Labor government actually refused to spend the money and do the upgrade. We have Mount Cotton Road, where Mick de Brenni dived in to announce traffic lights outside a school, and now he is having to put a second set of traffic lights 80 metres down the road because they failed to plan the intersection. Then Cross River Rail was trumpeted as saving Redlanders 14 minutes on their commute, but you actually have to change trains to get on the Cross River Rail, which chews up the 14 minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need delivery in this area and we need MPs to stand up against a state Labor government that's basically ticking along, offending no-one, but getting nothing done. We're a growing state. We can do far better than what we've had so far. Redlanders are asking for the major arterials to be addressedâ€”to stop spending money on boat and bus stops and to start remembering that public transport doesn't work if you don't fix the roads that are under it.
