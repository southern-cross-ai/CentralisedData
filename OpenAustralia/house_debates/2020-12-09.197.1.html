        2020 has certainly been a year to remember. If you had told me last year that we'd have a global pandemic, I wouldn't have believed you. To deal with the COVID-19 crisis, the Morrison-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">
         McCormack
        </a>
        government responded swiftly with a record $257 billion of economic support through JobKeeper, JobSeeker, the cash flow boost and the $750 payments to millions of pensioners and others on income support. I'm very proud that we have helped so many Australians get through this pandemic. The Morrison-McCormack government have also extended HomeBuilder. It is doing exactly what it was intended to doâ€”driving demand and helping to protect the jobs of one million Australians employed in our vital construction sector.

        I have achieved a great deal for Capricornia this year, continuing to deliver on my election commitments and to deliver funding for more projects in the local area, including: in Rockhampton, $60 million for the Rockhampton to Gracemere road duplication and $23 million for a new stadium at the Rockhampton sports club; on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        , $20 million for the Keppel Bay Sailing Club convention centre, over $700,000 in category C bushfire recovery funding and $75,000 for upgrades to the Emu Park Swimming Club; and in Mackay, Sarina and Walkerston, over $14 million in road safety improvements on the

         Peak Downs Highway
        </a>
        between Mackay and Eton, over $9 million for road upgrades in the Mackay region outs of the Roads to Recovery fund. In Moranbah, there is over $50,000 in category C, Central Queensland Bushfires Flexible Funding Grants and over $4,000 to 4RFM community radio for new computers and recording equipment. In Clermont, there is over $275,000 to upgrade the Clermont Showground and over $100,000 in Central Queensland Bushfires Flexible Funding Grants. In Collinsville, there is over $830,000 to upgrade a six-megalitre water reservoir and equip the water and sewerage treatment plants with solar panels. And there's the passing of our government's funding for a feasibility study for a coal-fired power station in Collinsville. This is only a small snapshot of what we have achieved in 2020.

        The year 2020 has been a difficult year, but it's also been one of delivery for the Liberal-National government. To everyone in Capricornia: I will continue to fight for you, your jobs and your families in 2021 and beyond. I would like to acknowledge all the health workers, who worked tirelessly during the pandemic. The lifting of restrictions is from all the hard work that you all put in. I wish to say thank you to every one of you. I also want to pay tribute to everyone in my electorate for their dedication and resilience during the pandemic. Your efforts in adhering to medical advice helped everyone get out of lockdown faster and safer. To everyone in Capricornia, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a safe and prosperous

        . I'd like to thank my wonderful staff, who always go that extra mile, my family, who are my greatest supporters, and the many volunteers who support us year after year. Merry Christmas, and here's to a COVID-free 2021.
