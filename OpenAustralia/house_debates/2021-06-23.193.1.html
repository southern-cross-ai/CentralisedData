        The 27th National General Assembly of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Local Government Association
        </a>
        is concluding in Canberra today. It has been a pleasure to meet with the leaders of the two local government areas overlapping my seat of Fraser, including the mayor of Maribyrnong, Councillor Michael Clarke, and the mayor and deputy mayor of Brimbank, Councillors Ranka Rasic and Jasmine Nguyen. Their visit to Canberra has provided a welcome opportunity to discuss our shared commitment to the communities of Melbourne's west. We know that our communities and the people we represent are crying out for the Morrison government to properly invest in the infrastructure that our rapidly growing part of Melbourne needs. The Andrews Labor government in Victoria has led the way in removing level crossings, making record investment in schools, and building the Joan Kirner Women's and

        </a>
        in Sunshine and the new Footscray Hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        An Albanese Labor government will invest $15 billion to rebuild our industrial base and to restore highly skilled manufacturing in areas like Sunshine. We'll deliver better and more affordable child care, whilst this government believes that child care just discourages women from staying in their homes. We'll fix aged care, which this government has ignored for eight long years. We'll invest in affordable homes for essential workers. Unfortunately, we've seen this week that the Morrison-Joyce government is more interested in itself than governing for the residents of Fraser, Brimbank and Maribyrnong. It's time for the Morrison-Joyce government to step up and invest in the west with its many needs and rapidly growing population.
