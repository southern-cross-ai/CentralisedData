        I rise this afternoon to talk about Sam and Vanessa, and their family. A beautiful family in my electorate, they are the quintessential Ryan family. They live in Mitchelton and they have three beautiful kids. Like many in Australia—and in Ryan, of course—they are working their guts out to pay the bills, to help their kids and to maybe even save enough for a reno. In many ways they are 'quiet Australians'. When I met them last week in their home in Mitchelton, I spoke about how important it was that the Morrison government had got on with delivering tax relief to 10 million Australians so that they got to keep more of their money to spend on their family. In fact, over 72,000 Ryan taxpayers now have more money in their pockets to spend on their families and to spend on doing the things that they like to do. Over 26,000 residents in Ryan alone are now receiving the full tax offset of $1,080, thanks to the work of the Morrison government in just its first week in parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        And it's about more than just the dollars and cents, isn't it? It's about the fact that we went to an election with this tax plan. It was laid out. It was fully costed in the budget. It was explained to the Australian people. In the first week after parliament came back, we kept faith with those who had put their faith in us and we delivered it for Australians. It shouldn't be overlooked that this tax relief is on top of stopping Labor $387 billion worth of new taxes that, on 19 May, they were ready to impose on Australians if they were given the opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a refrain in modern politics that people lament the lack of long-term planning or reform, and yet in the tax relief that this parliament has passed, that the Morrison government put forward, we see that long-term reform and planning writ large. It locks in, for 2024-25, reducing the tax rate from 32.5 per cent to 30 per cent, and it abolishes the 37 per cent bracket entirely. At that point, 94 per cent of Australians will pay just 30c in the dollar, so they can keep that money in their pockets and pay less tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I say that's locked in, I mean it's locked in with the re-election of the Morrison government. That's because Labor have kept open the option of rolling it back if they get the opportunity in 2022. So, to the families of Ryan who are now enjoying more money in their pockets, the choice is still clear, isn't it? You've got the Morrison government, who is going to deliver more money into your pockets, with lower taxes, and you've got the Labor Party, who are leaving open the option of rolling back the tax reform that the Morrison government has already put in place, and delivering more taxes. So continue to support us and keep faith, and we'll keep faith with the quiet Australians.
