        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , ushering in the

         Year of the Dragon
        </a>
        , and they have been nothing short of amazing. We are so lucky to have the Albanese Labor government, and I speak on behalf of the Chinese community in Western Australia about the honour of hosting the Prime Minister at the Western Australian Chinese New Year Ball. To witness the Prime Minister; state premiers of Western Australia, past and present; and many ministers standing side-by-side in embracing the rich culture of the Western Australian Chinese community was a sight to behold. The feedback from many of my constituents who were also in attendance affirmed the Prime Minister's reputation as a leader who is inclusive, progressive and genuinely caring. Lunar New Year is not just a cultural event; it is a time honoured tradition that symbolises new beginnings, renewal and progress. This event was particularly significant for the Chinese community in Western Australia, as it marks the first time in over three decades that a prime minister has graced the Western Australian Chinese community with their presence during Lunar New Year festivities.

        I was particularly touched by the Prime Minister's decision to accept the invitation extended by the Western Australian Chinese community during his last visit to my electorate of Tangney last year. It speaks volumes about the progress we have made as a nation and what truly makes us Australians. The countless contributions the Chinese community has made in Western Australia for over a century are not unrecognised or underappreciated by this government.
       </p>

        This colourful celebration truly embraced our multiculturalism here in Australia, transcending cultural boundaries and inviting everyone to partake in the joy of a new year. To have the Prime Minister there with us that evening was a reminder that, as leaders, we have a responsibility to foster an environment where every individual feels seen, heard and valued. May we continue to build Australia as a country where diversity is celebrated, where opportunity knows no bounds and where every Australian can feel proud to call this great land home.
