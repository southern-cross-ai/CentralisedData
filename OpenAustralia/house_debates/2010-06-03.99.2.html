       <p>
        Today I would like to bring the serious concerns of constituents in my electorate of Forrest to the attention of the government. In May the Labor Minister for Resources and Energy announced the government would allow oil and gas exploration in the Mentelle Basin in Commonwealth waters off the coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_River" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret River
        </a>
        , as one of 31 new offshore exploration leases around the country. The minister may be aware of the potential for oil and gas deposits to exist off Margaret River, but my constituents are also aware of the existing environmental qualities of the area, as well as the current and future environmental, lifestyle, tourism and surfing potential of the south-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , which includes Margaret River in its heartland.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that Margaret River is recognised and valued as an international destination and for its environmental qualities. The communities living in and around the spectacular and, in places, rugged south-west coast have long recognised that they are privileged to live in one of the most ecologically valuable environments in Australia and internationally. The communities also recognise that with that privilege comes the responsibility to care for and protect the land, air and water resources in their area. They and I want to be assured that the Labor government also understand their direct responsibility in this regard.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister has said that the strongest safety and environment protection regulations will be in place. However, how can a community like Margaret River trust this Labor government and the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett? They are responsible for the tragic and disastrous Home Insulation Program that has seen four young Australians lose their lives, over 100 house fires, thousands of roofs at risk—endangering the lives of thousands of people—and a potential billion dollar clean-up bill for taxpayers. I have no confidence in this environment minister and this government when they could not even deliver the Green Loans Program. On that basis, how can the residents of Margaret River and the wonderful south-west possibly trust the environment minister and the government to protect the pristine environment in which they live and which they love?
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask how the minister for resources will assure my constituents that exploration and possible extraction of oil and gas will not impact on them, their homes or, either on land or in the ocean, the wonderful region in which they live. I specifically ask the minister: what safeguards has he put in place to protect the people and the environment of the south-western forest? Even the local shire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        was recently quoted in the
        <i>
         Augusta Margaret River Mail
        </i>
        saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The shire is aware of the high level conservation issues which would need to be considered as a high priority in any policy development and would be sensitive to the community’s wishes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very serious issue for many residents in my electorate of Forrest.
