       <p>
        I rise today to talk about DisabilityCare Australia, as big a change in this generation as Medicare was in our parents' generation. It will transform the lives of Australians with disabilities and their carers. We are creating this new scheme and locking in funding for the future. By 2018-19, around 150,000 people with disability in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        will be benefiting from DisabilityCare Australia and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. If a person has a permanent disability that means they cannot function without help with things like getting around or communicating, it is likely that they will get support from DisabilityCare Australia. We estimate that in my electorate of Sydney around 1,800 people, 1,837 individuals, will be eligible for help.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the weekend of Saturday, 25 May, I met at a street stall with a beautiful family, Karen and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Keith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and their children Aaron and Roxy. Aaron was born with cerebral palsy and Karen, Aaron and Roxy came to thank me as a representative of the government because, the very day before, on Friday, 24 May, Aaron had taken his first step unaided, and he had been able to do that because of the physiotherapy he had received through the Better Start program. Lives are being changed already with Better Start; imagine the difference that DisabilityCare will make to Aaron's life in the future.

        I have been contacted by many constituents. Cate from Redfern said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I cant imagine the emotional, physical and financial stresses of more severe disability in a family, where there are no points of rest, and the impact of one member having to not work and be a full time carer with little support.
       </p>
       <p>
        She supports DisabilityCare Australia. Julie from Balmain says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have a friend and a grandchild with a disability. Three year old Adi's parents are great, but I can see they are flagging. Adi's disability is profound.. she may never speak; and has to be strapped into a standing chair. But she is a bright and beautiful, loving little girl and we are all frantic … at the stress on her parents now, and the terrible fear there will be no-one to care for her when they die. This is not a club anyone chooses to join.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their lives can also be changed by the National Disability Insurance Scheme or DisabilityCare Australia. Finally, I saw some correspondence from Neil, who talks about his daughter and having to ask friends and colleagues to help raise money to have their car converted so it can take her wheelchair. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        promises to be a God send for the many hundreds of thousands in similar situations to ourselves. The potential for funding to be provided for things like vehicle conversions … will mean that the wonderful and overwhelming generosity of friends, family, charities and others can go to others who are in desperate need of assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 'stigma' if I can use that word, of having to ask for help is a very heavy burden. To now know that help can be provided by the Government through an equitable levy paid by all Australians, is a positive and reassuring step forward for all carers.
