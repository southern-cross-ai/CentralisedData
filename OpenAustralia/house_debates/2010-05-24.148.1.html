         Last Thursday
        </a>
        evening I had the pleasure of presenting awards to some fantastic young people at the Association for the Blind of WA-Guide Dogs WA 2010 awards ceremony in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        I was invited to speak to the audience about the importance of believing in yourself and how vital it is to set big goals and refuse to accept limitations. It was humbling and inspiring to see that so many in the audience had already achieved those goals. Ryan Honschooten was the

        Two of my constituents received awards, and I want to make a special mention of them. Kelsey Allen of Victoria Park was runner-up in the Angus Stewart Achievement Award and was awarded the Ida Lloyd Fellowship. Kelsey received the awards because of her achievements in the academic and musical arenas. The awards will assist her with music lessons at the University of WA. I was also pleased to present Sagar Verma of Cannington with the Fred and Lorna Craggs Award. This award will allow Sagar to attend
