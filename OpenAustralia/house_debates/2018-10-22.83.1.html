        On Saturday I was privileged to join the celebrations for Toukley Preschool Kindergarten's 50th anniversary with my nephew John. Now John's at big school, he was delighted to visit his old preschool again. The preschool began with the vision of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Chambers" rel="nofollow">

        , the first director, and her good friends Neisha Farrell, Faye Northey and Florence Shergold, who, walking down the main street of Toukley in 1961, said, 'This place needs a kindergarten.' Sadly, Pat died in September. She would have loved to have joined the occasion.

        I would like to congratulate the many committee and staff members of Toukley Preschool Kindergarten who have contributed to 50 years of quality early childhood education, and acknowledge the preschool's status as an exceeding centre. I would particularly like to acknowledge Aunty Bronwyn Chambers, Pat's daughter-in-law who welcomed us to country, for sharing her fond memories and for her strong role in education on the
