       <p>
        Today I would like to reflect on the life of a local Reid legend. Mr Lerryn William Mutton
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        passed away on 26 July aged 90 years. Lerryn was born in Concord and educated at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Strathfield" rel="nofollow">
         North Strathfield
        </a>
        Public School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Street_Boys_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Fort Street Boys High School
        </a>
        . After graduating from school, Lerryn joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        and served from 1942 until 1946 in the 93rd squadron as a pilot in Borneo.
       </p>
       <p>
        After serving with distinction and courage Lerryn continued to give generously to his community. He served as an alderman of Concord council from 1953 until 1968, serving as mayor from 1961 to 1962. He was an executive member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government Association
        </a>
        from 1962 until 1968.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not yet satisfied with this service to his community, he then served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state parliament as the member for Yaralla, in the legislative assembly, from 1968 to 1978. As a proud Liberal, Lerryn also served as president of the North Strathfield branch and president of the Concord electorate conference. Lerryn was an active member of the Master Builders Association and a proud Rotarian, and he continued to be active in community activities until very late in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2010 Lerryn was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for service to the communities of Concord and Kincumber. Lerryn was a much loved husband of Mavis, father to Brice, Ross, Merrilyn and David, and a loved brother of my dear friend—and another local legend—Lorna Wright. May he rest in peace.
       </p>
