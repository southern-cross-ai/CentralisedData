       <p>
        Domestic violence is still rife in our communities and continues to poison our country, tearing families apart, destroying lives and causing an unspeakable amount of pain. It's truly a most vicious cycle. I have spoken out about the topic of domestic violence in this room before and will continue to speak up because I will not stand by and be silent on this issue. I truly hope there will come a day when I can say that domestic violence is no longer an issue, that women, children and men can feel safe in their own homes and within their communities without fearing for their lives or those of their children. Until then, we have a lot of work to do in order to put a stop to it now and forever. That's why it's so important for our communities to stand up, say no to violence and say to those who are experiencing violence that they are not alone.

        region will join together in a sea of red and send a message that domestic violence is not tolerated. The Moreton Bay Red Ride on 1 May will see many bikers in red put the pedal to the metal and raise funds which will go to Act For Kids and Variety, the children's charity, all in the name of supporting those who are experiencing or who have experienced domestic violence. I'm proud to see the community of Longman come together to bring an end to domestic violence. I would like to thank Rotary Caboolture for putting together this event to support this important initiative. Tickets for the Red Ride are on sale for those who wish to support this important cause.
