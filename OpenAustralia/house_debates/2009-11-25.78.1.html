        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to his recent list of 32 large-scale projects which he said had been announced, built and completed by Labor since the 2007 election. The list includes the Dynon rail link near the port of Melbourne. I also refer the minister to this April 2006 photograph, taken from the minister’s own website, which has the caption ‘Federal transport minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Truss" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the shadow minister for his question. He indeed is not correct. Earlier this year, I went to the Dynon rail link and opened it with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rail_Track_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Rail Track Corporation

          Barry Murphy
         </a>
         . Last night, we were indeed with the Australian Rail Track Corporation, along with the finance minister, and we had a discussion about the opening of the Dynon rail link and the fact that the ribbon being held by the chair of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTC" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , Barry Murphy, and me across the rail link was not quite long enough and we had to make a decision about who would get hit by the train—me or the chair of the ARTC. The chair of the ARTC got out of the way because he understood that it is that side of politics that likes getting run over by trains, usually self-inflicted.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am asked about the government’s infrastructure commitments and what we have been doing, and the shadow minister refers to what they have done. That is timely, because he was the minister for transport in the former government and today, indeed, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics has released a document, ‘Public road related expenditure and revenue in Australia 2009’, that goes through—

            That report makes pretty interesting reading, because what it indicates is that the Howard government, in its last two budgets, slashed road spending by almost 40 per cent.

                   We are not going to enter into debate about points of order by way of interjections. In fact, I think that, reasonably, if the question indicates something that the minister has disagreement about, the minister is going to go to those points. The minister is responding to the question.

                      Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The reason I was holding that photo is because, when the question was asked by the Leader of the National Party, he used the photo as a prop to illustrate the fact that the question was about a rail link and nothing to do with roads.
