       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to introduce the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021 to the House. This bill is part of a package of three bills, including the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill 2021 and the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure (Regulatory Levies) Bill 2021, which were introduced into the House on 2 September 2021.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together these bills establish a regulatory framework to enable offshore electricity infrastructure projects, including transmission and generation projects, in Commonwealth waters. The main bill supports investment in large-scale offshore electricity infrastructure through a new licensing regime administered and regulated by the Offshore Infrastructure Registrar and the Offshore Infrastructure Regulator.
       </p>
       <p>
        The regulatory levies bill ensures the Offshore Infrastructure Registrar and the Offshore Infrastructure Regulator are fully cost recovered to undertake the functions required to facilitate the life cycle of offshore electricity infrastructure projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill, the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021, updates five Commonwealth acts to clarify the operation of those acts with the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consequential amendments bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (known as the OPGGS Act) to clarify how it is intended to work alongside the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill. The OPGGS Act is amended to ensure regulated entities under the OPGGS Act do not unduly interfere with the activities of regulated entities under the offshore electricity infrastructure framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments are also made to reflect NOPSEMA's dual role in regulating the OPGGS Act and the OEI framework, and to clarify that NOPTA may be appointed as the registrar of the OEI framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also make minor amendments to other acts to allow the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill to operate as intended. This includes updating definitions for offshore electricity infrastructure and to provide for similar arrangements to the offshore electricity sector that are provided to the offshore resources sector. Supporting the development of large projects in a new offshore industry represents an exciting new opportunity for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together the three bills comprising the offshore electricity infrastructure package will enable the development of a new industry that will create jobs, strengthen our economy and facilitate a more affordable and secure energy system.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
