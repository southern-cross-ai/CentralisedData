        This morning I want to recognise and thank all of the participants in the

         Relay For Life

        who walked and ran around the Don Road football facility a couple of weekends ago. As we know, the Relay For Life—which is held in all of our electorates right across Australia—is a time for people to come together to remember and reflect on friends, relatives and loved ones who have suffered or may be suffering from cancer. It is a time to raise much needed funds but also a time to raise awareness. The Relay for Life started late in the afternoon and ran for 18 hours through until the Sunday morning and saw many teams from the Yarra Ranges and from across the federal electorate of Casey turn up, participate and raise much needed funds and awareness. This is the 10th year of the Relay For Life in the Yarra Ranges, held at Healesville. Last year, it raised $95,000. So far this year it has raised more than $65,000 and donations are still rolling in, with the period open for donations running until mid-December. I want to pay tribute to the organising committee, who did a fantastic job; to each of the team leaders; and to all of the participants, who took time out to make their contribution.
       </p>

        One of the many teams was Team Thomas, named for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Thomas" rel="nofollow">
         Wayne Thomas
        </a>
        who is part of a well-known community in Warburton. They are a great family; they are a family I have got to know very well over the years. Wayne was diagnosed with a brain tumour in June of this year. He has undergone surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. His future daughter-in-law, Rebecca Cluning, and his son, Michael, took it upon themselves to organise Team Thomas. It included the entire family—43 people—who signed up, from grandparents Keith and Edna in their 80s right through to the youngest, 10-month-old Savannah and three-year-olds, Heidi and Mitchell. Team Thomas did a great job: they set out to raise $5,000, and so far they have raised more than $12,000.
