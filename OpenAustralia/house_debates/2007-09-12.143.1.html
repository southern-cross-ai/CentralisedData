        These proposed amendments to the bill are minor in nature and generally result from drafting errors. The amendments will ensure that the reforms being introduced by the bill operate as intended. Amendment (1) excludes division 3A of part III of the Insurance Act, which deals with the transfer and amalgamation of insurance business, from the list of provisions for which the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prudential_Regulation_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
        </a>
        can grant an exemption. This ensures that the list of modifiable provisions is consistent with the proposals announced in ‘Streamlining prudential regulation: response to
        <i>
         Rethinking regulation’
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (2) repeals section 49D of the Insurance Act dealing with self-incrimination as new section 38F of the Insurance Act will provide protection from self-incrimination. Collectively, amendments (3) and (14) give effect to the phasing out of prudential rules in subsection 16C(4) of the Life Insurance Act 1995, the life act, by 30 June 2011. Amendment (4) ensures that use immunity provided under section 130B is retained.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (7) ensures that section 336F dealing with self-incrimination does not apply to sections 129 or 130 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI" rel="nofollow">
         SI
        </a>
        (S) Act, as self-incrimination in respect of these sections as dealt with by section 130B. Amendment (8) inserts a note to clarify that section 130B, which deals with self-incrimination, applies to sections 129 and 130. Amendment (9) renumbers the note that already exists as a result of amendment (8). The bill currently includes section 113 of the SI(S) Act in the list of modifiable provisions. However, section 113 is being repealed and replaced by the new section 35C. Amendments (5) and (6) ensure that the correct section is included in the list of modifiable provisions under the SI(S) Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (10) makes a consequential amendment to paragraph 121AO(2)(a) of the Income Assessment Act 1936 as a result of schedule 1 of the bill, abolishing the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board and removing the concept of actuarial standards from the life act from 1 January 2008. Sections 87 and 95 of the life act respectively require a life company to notify APRA when it appoints an auditor and actuary for the company. Amendments (11) and (12) ensure that additional matters to be included in the notice are dealt with in prudential standards rather than prescribed under the Life Insurance Regulations Act 1995. This is consistent with the principles based approach adopted in the bill, which provides that specific requirements relating to auditors and actuaries be set out in prudential standards. Amendment (13) ensures that regulations and prudential rules made under the life act are considered part of the act. Full details of the amendments can be found in a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House.
