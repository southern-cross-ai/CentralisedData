        Tonight, I want to talk about the Voice referendum, which will be held in less than five weeks. I'm concerned about a few things. I'm concerned about the unfair playing field that the Albanese government has created in setting the rules of this referendum, rules that favour the 'yes' side. The truth is that the Prime Minister has made a mockery of this whole process. He's taken a lot of shortcuts, trashing convention along the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no constitutional convention. There was no attempt to build unity on an amendment that would have recognised Aboriginals and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islanders
        </a>
        in our Constitution. The parliamentary committee process was cut short. There have been no official 'yes' or 'no' campaigns so that all Australians can access and consider the competing arguments. Instead, it's been division and wedge politics from the start. Labor have stacked the deck for the 'yes' campaign at every turn, and, sadly, the Prime Minister has divided us as a country.
       </p>
       <p>
        But he hasn't done it alone. He's done it with the big end of town. Big business, big tech, big sport and big finance have all stood with the Prime Minister. 'Yes' enjoys huge financial, cultural, political and economic power in this debate, including free flights from Qantas and big dollars from big business—

        , Westpac, Woolworths, Coles, Telstra and so on. The Prime Minister refused to grant equal public funding for each side of the referendum because he knew he could count on big money flocking to the 'yes' campaign, and they sure are delivering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with big business and big finance, big sport is backing the Prime Minister's divisive Voice campaign. Every major sporting code is on the 'yes' ticket, and big tech like Facebook run a form of soft censorship with their underhanded

        Now, for the average Australian out there, it must feel like you don't have a voice—that you can't be heard. Tonight I'm giving Peter from Queensland a voice inside this chamber. Peter sent me an email last week, and I think he speaks for many Australians out there: those who love their country but who don't have the money or the power or the access like those in the 'yes' campaign. Here is what Peter wrote to me on Saturday 2 September:
