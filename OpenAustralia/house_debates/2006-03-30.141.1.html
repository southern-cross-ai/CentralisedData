        I rise today to express my absolute outrage at the government’s attitude to and actions towards what is a significant and valuable Australian institution, an institution that for me personally was an incredible influence whilst I was growing up. I am referring to our national broadcasting corporation, which since 1996 has faced an onslaught from the government, which is determined to mould the ABC to its own liking and to silence its independence.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        is and has been an institution important to the life of this country. It has played a significant cultural role and has been reflective of the development of Australia’s cultural identity. Millions of Australians across the country rely on the ABC to keep them informed and to keep them entertained. The diversity and independence of programs available on the ABC is incredibly valuable, offering valuable children’s learning programs, great Australian drama and comedy, current affairs, world news and independent journalism. All of this is in jeopardy simply because of the government’s continued attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 10 long years the ABC has been gradually starved of its funding. Last October the ABC revealed to Senate estimates that in real terms it has $51 million less per year to make programs than when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        came into office. These funding cuts have had a serious impact on the ABC’s ability to fulfil its charter obligations. In 2003 budget shortfalls forced the ABC to close two digital TV channels,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_TV" rel="nofollow">
         Fly TV
        </a>
        and Kids TV. It also abandoned the long-running educational TV program
        <i>
         Behind the News
        </i>
        , a program watched in schools across the country. Last year the ABC broadcast only 13 hours of locally produced drama, compared with more than 100 hours in 2000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of supporting an independent institution which is valued by Australians, we have seen the government publicly floating the idea of introducing advertisements on the ABC. I completely oppose the introduction of ads on the ABC, and so does the Labor Party. Labor understands the impact advertising will have on the independence, innovation and integrity of the ABC. If advertising were to be introduced, broadcasting policy and content would undoubtedly be influenced by the demands of advertisers. All Australians hope and expect that the ABC will be innovative, educational, informative, entertaining and daring. This is what we want from our ABC. But the ABC cannot and will not fulfil these expectations if it is to instead become hostage to advertising pressures and the need to compete in ratings wars with the commercial networks which it is competing with for the advertising dollar.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following this suggestion, the minister for communications promised to review the ABC’s efficiency and whether it was receiving adequate funding. The minister appointed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG" rel="nofollow">
         KPMG
        </a>
        to do this. Even though this report has been received, it has not been released. Despite efforts by the minister to withhold the report’s contents, sources have revealed that the report has found that the ABC is seriously underfunded. The
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        today revealed that the draft summary of the report warns of cuts to services if the ABC does not receive an extra $125 million, above inflation, over the next three years. The report says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Even with indexation we do not believe the ABC could sustain its present range, quality and mix of outputs at its present level of funding ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Recommendations by this report suggest that a seven per cent increase in total funding is necessary. I call on the minister to today release the report. As budget week fast approaches, I ask the government to seriously consider any decision to refuse further funding to the ABC.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also heard that the minister wants to cut the staff-appointed board position. This would have dire consequences for the ABC and for our much valued institution. The staff elected director makes a valuable and important contribution to the ABC’s corporate governance as the only director independent of the government. The Australian public wants to continue to be well served by an independent public broadcaster, funded and free from commercial and political pressures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor believes that the ABC and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        are two of Australia’s most important community institutions. Labor is committed to ensuring adequate funding and support for Australia’s public broadcasters to enable them to continue to provide Australians with high-quality broadcasting services free from political interference. The ABC is important—it is important to Australians and it is important to Australia. I stand here today to implore the government to end its attacks and to give the ABC the support it needs.
