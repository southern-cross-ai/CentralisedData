        I rise to reflect on and pay tribute to a school in my electorate, St Peter's Girls School, which celebrated it's 125th anniversary at a remarkably well attended dinner on Saturday night. I was very honoured to be one of the special invited guests and to be with more than 600 people at a sellout celebration of their 125 years educating young women from Adelaide. It was a spectacular celebration of the history of a school that's educated more than 10,000 young women who have gone on to contribute so much to the city of Adelaide, the state of
