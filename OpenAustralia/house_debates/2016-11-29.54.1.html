        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister outline why it is important to restore the rule of law on building sites across the country? How does this compare with the approach to the union movement in other countries?

         I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. He would know that it is important to restore the rule of law on building and construction sites in Australia by bringing back the Australian Building and Construction Commission, because he would know, as most members on this side of the House do, that the last time the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
          ABCC
         </a>
         existed it saved consumers $7½ billion in costs and it increased productivity by 16 per cent in the building and construction sector while the ABCC was in place. That is one of the reasons it needs to be brought back into existence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to building and construction sites and bringing back the rule of law and bringing the unions to heel with respect to building and construction is very fair and it is very middle of the road. I am asked how this compares to other countries. One of the countries which I would like to compare it to is Cuba because I have noticed an outpouring of praise for the former President of Cuba
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" rel="nofollow">
          Fidel Castro
         </a>
         in the last 24 hours from members of the Labor Party. But here is what
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch" rel="nofollow">
          Human Rights Watch
         </a>
         had to say about Fidel Castro's Cuba:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Under Fidel Castro, the Cuban government refused to recognize the legitimacy of Cuban human rights organizations, alternative political parties, independent labor unions, or a free press. He … denied … the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Red Cross
         </a>
         and … Human Rights Watch access to the island to investigate human rights conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         So Fidel Castro actually suppressed independent unions in Cuba—a much more extreme measure than the government is taking to try and restore the rule of law.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, in the last 24 hours, Labor appears to have rediscovered their inner communists, because this is what our old friend Senator Kim Carr said on the passing of Fidel Castro: 'Vale Fidel Castro, extraordinary 20th century figure. Survived 50-year embargo and 638
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" rel="nofollow">
          CIA
         </a>
         attempts on life using ex-lovers.' That is kind of in the weird category. But the member for Hindmarsh said: 'Fidel Castro went from law student to revolutionary leader, communist figurehead and polarising global icon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIP" rel="nofollow">
          RIP
         </a>
         Fidel.' This guy is on a first name basis with Fidel Castro! I suppose he calls the Ceausescus 'Nicolae and Elena', as well, does he?
        </p>
        <p>
         It does not stop there. Troy Bramston exposed today that Shorten often has talked about seeing Castro give one of his speeches that went for hours: 'It was amazing!' Shorten gushed. Oh Lord, save us from soft-boiled lefties!
