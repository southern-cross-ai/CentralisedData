        I encourage everybody in Parramatta and surrounds to come on down to Creativity Unleashed on 6 October. It's a great local expo, originally started by the Community Migrant Resource Centre, that displays our great local artists in the fields of photography, visual art, fashion, poetry and music. This year I'm going to have a stall. A lot of people have come down to my stall at Parramasala for local designers, but this time it's going to be bigger and better than ever. At my stall this year, we'll have Ruth Fattal, who does formal and bridal wear among other things—and there are a few things of hers in my wardrobe; Seewaa Seth with her Masai jewellery; Shipra from Melange Chic—which I happen to be wearing—with accessories and home furnishings; and Ramya from Evaloka, who handcrafts her own beautiful jewellery. We also have Resham from Indie Colours, Vaibhavi from Maa, Patsy from Vouernchea and Mansi from Mash Accessories, who do vegan accessories. They're a great bunch of local designers and absolutely worthy of local support. It'll be in Parramatta CBD at 7

        on 6 October from 11 to four; 7 Smith Street is the courtyard behind Western Sydney University. I'm not aware of any other events that have been there before, because it's quite new, but it's a really interesting space and it's worth coming down to check it out. These are great local artists. We have so many in Parramatta. We're really fortunate. If we all get behind them, we will see them grow. Creativity Unleashed is on 6 October. Come on down.
