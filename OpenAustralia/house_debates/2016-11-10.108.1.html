        I want to speak about an amazing Territorian who recently passed away in Darwin.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lee" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Lee
        </a>
        was born Mary Cubillo in the 1930s. During her life she survived the bombing of Darwin, which took the life of her father, a wharfie, who was killed in the raid on Darwin in February 1942 while he was unloading the ship
        <i>
         Neptuna
        </i>
        . Mary Lee raised 15 children, survived

        </a>
        and graduated from university at the age of 64. Mary Lee met and was hugged by a president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">

        , who sent her photos of himself and his family wearing the beanies that Mary had crocheted for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was to fight for the recognition of native title and the Kenbi land claim, which was granted to the Larrakia people after 37 yearsâ€”just months before her death. She was to fight for the stolen generations. Her mother was removed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bathurst Island
        </a>
        , in the Tiwis, when she was a child. Mary Lee was to become renowned as an elegant and loving matriarch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary's story is that of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is a very Darwin story. It reflects that story of our nation and the often painful and shameful relationship with our first peoples. It also tells of the strength, resilience and enormous generosity of spirit that has enabled the nation's reconciliation movement and our national apology to the stolen generation, delivered by then

       </p>
       <p>
        To Mary's family I send my heartfelt condolences. Mary Lee, nee Cubillo, a proud Larrakia woman, will continue to inspire. It is the stories and lives of Australians like Mary who will continue to inspire me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge one of my staffers, Sharon McAlear, herself a Larrakia woman and long-time true believer. Her father, Richard Koolpinyah Barnes, is a proud Larrakia leader. I am very proud to have been elected this week as deputy chair of Labor's Aboriginal and

       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Solomon and the deputy chair of this committee, I will work to honour the memory of people like Mary Lee. May Mary Lee and those who have gone before her rest in peace with their ancestors in the knowledge that the
