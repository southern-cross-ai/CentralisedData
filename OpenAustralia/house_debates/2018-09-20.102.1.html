          I thank the member for his question. I think the events of about four or five weeks ago disappointed Australians greatly in the way that things were conducted in this place. I'm honest enough to admit that and tell the Australian people straight about it, and I did tell the Australian people straight about that, but I'll tell you what has happened since then: our party is quickly coming back together. We're getting back on the front foot.

            <p>
             I hear the jeers and sneers of the members opposite, but I can tell you that the Leader of the Opposition isn't looking as certain as he was two weeks ago, before we came back to this House. He has been sitting there in question time today with his cheeky little sneers, and they're doing their little stunts. They're looking under a bit more pressure than they did two weeks ago. Do you know why? Because our government is getting on with it, and they know it. They know our government is taking decisions that matter to the Australian people. They know that we're focused on the things that concern Australians, like dealing with food tampering.

               They know that we're focused 100 per cent on them, that we're looking through all the dust that those opposite want to kick up as they come into this place. Do you know how many of the more than 50 questions they've asked this week have been about drought? One, just one question on drought. They've been more interested in the politics of Canberra than in the principles, beliefs, values and issues the Australian people are interested in. That's why this Leader of the Opposition has not been able to convince the Australian people over five years that he's up to the job. They know he's a phony. They know he's not up to it. This has been demonstrated by him every day in the job. Our government over five years has been delivering for Australians, with a stronger economy, guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on, keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians together.

                 . I know that the Leader of the Opposition, after our last change of the leadership, said that he has been responsible for dispatching four leaders. Two of them were his own. He said to a colleague on this side of the House after it happened, 'That makes four.' That's how this Leader of the Opposition sees this place. He sees it as a political game where he gets together with his union thug mates, gets around and tries to dispense his power and influence. The Australian people see right through this bloke. They can see right into him.
