        Yesterday was the last day of autumn, and it was a wonderful day to represent the Prime Minister of Australia, the member for Griffith and my next-door neighbour, at the Tarragindi War Memorial Kindy Fete. There were huge crowds at the fete and some of the best produce seen in Brisbane. In fact, I think my staff and my family will be eating my purchases for weeks to come. I turned up with the local councillor for Moorooka,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Griffiths" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the state member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Finn" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I even saw a couple of other elected representatives at the fete as well. It is certainly a sign of a good fete when you can bring in the

        as well as politicians who are not even local representatives. I have never seen so many happy smiling faces—the kids, that is. Most of them had painted faces. Some of the parents looked a little bit stressed, but only until they got their lovely coffee.

        I thank all the teachers and staff, particularly Natasha Sommer and the organising committee, the volunteers, the parents and especially the sponsors for the great work that they put into the fete. I was there with my wife, Lea, and our two sons, and we will be back next year. For those people from Tarragindi who I did not see at the fete, I hope that I will see you later down the track at the
