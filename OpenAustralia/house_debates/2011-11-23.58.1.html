        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill delivers on the government's commitment to reduce business compliance costs for excise liable businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        These taxpayers, operating under the existing standard seven-day excise settlement period, beginning Monday and ending Sunday, will become eligible to apply for a new weekly period, to begin on their preferred day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The codification of the seven-day period will provide certainty to businesses. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the particular seven-day cycle that best suits the business's commercial practice will reduce their administration costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, small businesses will be able to apply for permission to defer their excise settlement to a monthly reporting cycle, with a further 21 days from the end of the month to remit their tax liability. This will considerably reduce the administration and cash management burden on small businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, a small business would previously have paid excise to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        every seven days although their typical business terms may be for a 30-day settlement. This bill gives small businesses at least 21 days, and up to 51 days, to remit their tax liabilityâ€”which will significantly help with their cash management.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, small businesses will be required to lodge only 12 returns per year, as opposed to 52 returns per year under the current arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this bill, business entities with no duty liabilities may have the terms of their seven-day or monthly permission amended to a longer reporting cycle at the discretion of the tax commissioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a business's permission relates to gaseous fuel on a seven-day permission, this bill will allow that business to give the commissioner a return, on or before the sixth business day following the end of each seven-day period. This bill also ensures that the existing monthly settlement arrangement for stabilised crude oil and condensate will remain unchanged.
       </p>
       <p>
        These arrangements reflect the particular commercial circumstances of the gaseous fuel, stabilised crude oil and condensate industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the amendments in this bill are contained in the combined explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
