       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to recognise one of Forde's most generous and active community members, David Look, who, sadly, passed away recently aged 66. David was an active, caring and generous person who was involved in many activities around our local community, and he would always come up to you and say, 'G'day, Bloke.' He was a life member and past president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        Horse and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Carriage Club
        </a>
        and was actively involved in the agricultural show circuit, including stewarding at the Gold Coast and Beenleigh Shows as well as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Easter_Show" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Easter Show
        </a>
        for many years. David's love of horses kept him busy as a member of several clubs, including the Australian Carriage Driving Society, the Queensland Donkey Society and the Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society.
       </p>
       <p>
        David was also a very proud Rotarian and passionate executive member of the Beenleigh and District Historical Society, where he was president for the past two years. More recently, David was a founding member of the Beenleigh District Men's Shed, an initiative of Rotary. He was a friend to all who knew him and worked in the community with enormous vigour and good humour to make it a better place. David, you will be sorely missed by so many in our community. Thank you, Bloke, for all you have done to make our community a better place.
