         I thank the member for Spence for his question. He has the privilege of representing the northern suburbs of our great city of Adelaide, a community centred around Elizabeth, which of course gave us
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Barnes" rel="nofollow">
          Jimmy Barnes
         </a>
         and many thousands of Holden motor vehicles until, of course, those opposite decided to shut down the car industry a decade ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the member for Spence has also been a relentless advocate for our Strengthening Medicare program to boost bulk-billing, to make medicines cheaper and to roll out urgent care clinics, including the urgent care clinic in Elizabeth. It's open seven days a week, it's fully bulk-billed for patients and, importantly, it's taking much-needed pressure off the local
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyell_McEwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Lyell McEwin Hospital
         </a>
         . Suzannah's Google review is a good example of the hundreds of patients that are seen every week at the Elizabeth clinic. She wrote in her review:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Extremely quick check in to the Elizabeth Urgent Care Centre for a laceration to my hand. Highly recommend this over waiting many hours in an

          Emergency Department
         </a>
         . Perfect example at what's urgent, but not an emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 58 urgent care clinics that we opened last year have already seen 425,000 patients and are delivering urgent care, all fully bulk-billed. We also committed to boosting bulk-billing for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         visits more generally, through a $3½ billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentive. I'm pleased to report today that, in the seven months since that funding kicked in, bulk-billing has risen in every single state and territory in the federation—by five per cent in our state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , by more than eight per cent in the state of Tasmania—across the country delivering around 1.7 million additional free visits to the doctor in just seven months.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
          In April
         </a>
         alone, there were 425,000 additional free visits to the doctor that would not have occurred but for the changes we made last year. For Labor, that's a big deal, because, for Labor, bulk-billing is the beating heart of Medicare.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, of course, our approach here could not be more different from that of those opposite, reflected in the member's question about 10 years of cuts and neglect, led by a man who 10 years ago famously said there were too many free Medicare services—too many apparently!—a man who then tried to abolish bulk-billing altogether in his horror health budget, delivered 10 years ago almost to the day. That's not our way in Labor. Medicare is in our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
          DNA
         </a>
         . That's why the member for Spence and every single member on this side of the House is fighting so hard to strengthen it.

               The deputy leader asked me about the trajectory of bulk-billing. I was very clear in the lead-in to the last election—and I have been since—that bulk-billing has been falling over the last period of time, and it's no surprise. If you freeze the income of general practice for six years, which is what the Leader of the Opposition kicked off in that budget I referred to and what was continued by the deputy leader when she was the health minister, things will change. I've been honest about this. I've also been more transparent and honest about what is actually happening around bulk-billing than those opposite were. They tried to cloak the bulk-billing figure in the one-off COVID measures that had to be bulk-billed.

                  The question was about bulk-billing rates after two years. I guess the minister wants to defend the accusation that they have or haven't dropped and is going to be talking about what he believes the rates were. I'm not exactly aware of what the rates are, so I can't adjudicate—

                 <p>
                  I know the member for Riverina is trying to help, but, trust me, he's not. I ask the minister to make sure he's being directly relevant for the remainder of the answer. He won't be able, for the remaining one minutes and 57 seconds, to talk about the opposition.

                   Unfortunately for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the world was not created on 21 May 2022. We inherited a Medicare system that had been deeply impacted by a decade of cuts and neglect. I said very openly that bulk-billing was continuing to slide, which is why we put, in the last budget in 2023, a record investment to turn bulk-billing around. I said that would not happen quickly. I was very honest about that. I was also more transparent with the Australian people about what was really happening in bulk-billing by starting to report how many visits to general practice were bulk-billed every single month. Those opposite never reported that. They cloaked and disguised their bulk-billing data in these one-off COVID data—these tens of millions of COVID—

                      Take a breather. The minister is entitled to do some compare and contrast, but, if he continues with that, I will sit him down. The deputy leader is correct in her point of order, and he needs to be mindful of the standing orders.

                       Well, Mr Speaker, no-one has talked about the sorry state of bulk-billing for the last several years, including since we came to government, more than me, which is why we put a record investment in last year's budget to turn it around. We tripled the bulk-billing incentive, and, since it kicked in on 1 November, it has started to rise in every single state and territory in the Federation, in seven months delivering 1.7 million additional visits. I've never sought to deny that bulk-billing was sliding. I advocated in this parliament, in the community and in the Expenditure Review Committee to deliver the biggest investment in the history of Medicare for bulk-billing.
