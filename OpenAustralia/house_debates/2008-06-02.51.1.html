        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on recent inflation data and the importance of responsible budgeting in the current inflationary environment?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. Responsible economic management is central to the fight against inflation. We have some data that came out today from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD" rel="nofollow">
          TD
         </a>
         —their monthly inflation gauge—and this is what they had to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Inflation remains the most pressing issue facing Australian policy makers.
        </p>
        <p>
         We on this side of the House understand that. We understand that responsible budgeting and investment in the future is needed to fight inflation. That is why we did deliver a responsible budget—a budget that cut back spending, a budget that began the vital task of investing in the future and addressing the capacity constraints that are putting upward pressure on inflation after years and years of neglect.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition on the other hand are content to try and blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus thereby putting further upward pressure on inflation and further upward pressure on interest rates. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say on the
         <i>
          Sunday
         </i>
         program, just after the budget:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Oakes: There is not a single suggestion in Dr Nelson’s speech of a saving.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Turnbull: ... that’s true. There is no suggestion of a saving there, that’s right ...
        </p>
        <p>
         And, of course, it is right. They have no credibility in this House when they pout around with supposed alternatives, because they cannot make a budget add up. The shadow Treasurer has had a bit more to say. This is what he said last week:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We recognise there is an overall impact on the budget, and that is something that we … take into account.
        </p>
        <p>
         How can you take it into account if you do not cost your policies? You cannot do it. The shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition are blowing a very big hole in the Liberal Party’s economic credibility, and it is nothing more than a smoking ruin.
