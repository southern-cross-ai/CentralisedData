       <p>
        by leave—I wish to take this opportunity to outline to the parliament how the Rudd government is enhancing the effectiveness of our national defence effort through science. In May the government tabled the Defence white paper titled
        <i>
         Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030
        </i>
        . In the white paper the government noted that the future operating environment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        will be shaped in large measure by changes in military technology and its employment. To this end, the government has placed increased emphasis on the ability of our Defence scientists to innovate and design new technologies and to apply and adapt existing technologies. In particular, we are developing a new role for our scientists in evaluating defence projects, analysing technical risk and designing risk management and risk mitigation strategies that will deliver increasingly robust defence capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, of course, was one of the first nations in the world to recognise the importance of applied science and dedicated scientific research in sustaining a credible national defence effort. For more than 100 years, science has been an integral part of Australia’s defence. From beginnings that were built around the technologies of the day—principally explosives and munitions—Australia’s defence science now covers the spectrum of our national defence capabilities. From kinetics to electro-optics, from metallurgy to adhesives, from aeronautics to nutrition, our scientists are fundamental to the technological edge that is essential if our defence force is to deliver the level of security that the Australian people expect of government. With strategic responsibility for a disproportionate share of the earth’s surface, but with a small population, Australia has to be both agile and smart if it is to maintain an adequate defence capacity. Defence science provides the ultimate force multiplier. While our scientists are largely unseen, they are extremely important to our national security. Their contribution is critical.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
         DSTO
        </a>
        is the lead agency charged with applying science and technology to protect and defend Australia and its national interests. DSTO delivers expert, impartial advice and innovative solutions for Defence and other elements of national security. DSTO supports Australia’s defence by providing, amongst other things:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         support to operations;
        </li>
        <li>
         support to the current force;
        </li>
        <li>
         support to the Defence acquisition strategy;
        </li>
        <li>
         accident investigation; and
        </li>
        <li>
         enabling research.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        DSTO’s capability also supports whole-of-government national security needs. Headed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Defence_Scientist" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Defence Scientist
        </a>
        , Dr Robert Clark, the DSTO has an annual budget of approximately $400 million and employs more than 2,300 staff, predominantly scientists, engineers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        specialists and technicians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DSTO has a presence across Australia. DSTO scientists also support the ADF on its deployments internationally, as well as working alongside our allies in their research establishments. At all times, DSTO works closely with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        , as well as with the broader industry, scientific and technology community, to enhance its ability to support Australia’s defence and national security capabilities and to contribute to national wealth. Staying at the forefront of the technology is key to the ADF’s capability edge. DSTO contributes directly to maintaining that edge by exploiting, adapting and developing new technology, so that our fighting men and women have the best possible equipment and platforms at their disposal. Moreover, DSTO’s work on human performance enables the men and women of our defence force to deliver maximum effect from their physical and psychological effort. Demands on DSTO’s science and technology support are extensive and continuous. The increased deployment of Australian troops overseas, the current global security environment and the challenges that it represents, new advances in technology and the multi-billion-dollar Defence acquisition program continue to place pressure on science and technology. DSTO’s track record in rising to these challenges is impressive and I will go through a number of the achievements and the work that is currently underway and in prospect.
       </p>
       <b>
        <p>
         Support to Operations
        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        Firstly, in relation to support for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADP" rel="nofollow">
         ADP
        </a>
        personnel in operations, with the increase in operational tempo over recent years DSTO has been responding to urgent operational demands by providing practical, life-saving solutions for the protection of Australian troops deployed around the world and by providing technology insertion, a key to the ADF’s mission. This direct support to operations has taken many forms—from embedding scientists within deployed units for immediate technical advice on mission effectiveness to developing customised camouflage uniforms. It also includes the provision of survivability kits and blast protection for ADF vehicles and sophisticated countermeasures to mitigate the effects of improvised explosive devices. This area of work in particular has contributed to saving the lives of ADP personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month I inaugurated the upgrade to the Air Operations Simulation Centre and the Melbourne operations of the DSTO. This is a unique Australian research facility, capable of accurately simulating the full scope of flight operations and combat scenarios for a variety of military aircraft. The facility is designed to introduce a far more realistic experience for pilots and operators and allows Defence to test-drive aircraft and tactics without leaving the ground. By re-creating real-life situations in a virtual environment, this facility allows air combat operations to be rehearsed and evaluated at a significantly reduced cost and without putting ADF personnel in harm’s way—although from my own experience in a simulator it does leave one potentially slightly motion sick.
       </p>
       <b>
        <p>
         Support to the current force
        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        Importantly, DSTO provides extensive support to the current force. In providing essential technical support to every aspect of Navy, Army
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        , intelligence and joint operations, DSTO both enhances existing capability and adapts it for Australia’s unique circumstances. DSTO also extends the service life and availability for use of these capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, more than ever, the ADF needs to extract every bit of value from the equipment it operates and to ensure that its people are able to carry out the demanding tasks of defence to the best of their ability. DSTO provides expert advice on reducing the cost of operating and maintaining that equipment and delaying the huge expense of replacing it by prolonging its effective performance. For more than 50 years, DSTO has been the indisputable world leader in testing airframes for metal fatigue and extending the lives of military aircraft, which was celebrated last month at DSTO’s Melbourne facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, DSTO’s rigorous testing of the fuselage centre barrel in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA" rel="nofollow">
         FA
        </a>
        18 Hornet proved that the actual life of this critical component was 10 per cent greater than originally certified. This finding has effectively given the aircraft an additional two years of flying life, providing the fleet with sufficient fatigue longevity to safely reach its planned withdrawal date. As a result, fewer aircraft than previously identified will need to have their centre barrels replaced and consequently Defence stands to save an estimated $400 million—roughly the equivalent of DSTO’s annual budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        A similar example is the recent completion of a fatigue test to ensure the structural integrity of the replacement wings fitted to the F111 fleet until their planned withdrawal date in the not-too-distant future. After nearly 38,000 hours of simulated flight tests without failure, DSTO was able to estimate the retirement life of the wings and recommend inspection intervals that minimise the burden of frequent maintenance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cost savings are not the only benefit of extending the life of aircraft components. Equally important, the platforms have been available for ADF use over longer periods of time instead of being grounded. This is vital in these days of increased operational requirement. We should also never forget that thorough testing of aircraft components contributes to the ongoing safety of our aircrews, and that is the predominant and overriding concern of the ADF.
       </p>
       <p>
        DSTO’s support for Navy has been equally important. The recently published history of the Collins class submarine highlighted how DSTO’s scientific expertise was fundamental to the overall success of the project. DSTO developed the steel and welding technology for the hulls; it developed the anechoic tiles which make them inaudible to other submarines or ships; and when the submarine project ran into difficulties it was DSTO which helped solve many of the problems with the diesels, the generators, the propeller, the noise signature of the vessel and the combat system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The result is that the Collins submarine is now acknowledged as a unique underwater platform operating at a ‘world’s best’ standard. In the book
        <i>
         The Collins Class Submarine Story: Steel, Spies and Spin
        </i>
        , the book’s authors summed up the DSTO contribution by saying that the scientists:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... grappled with and overcame the unexpected problems that inevitably arose when doing things for the first time. This effort demonstrated the importance of sustaining in Australia a body of technical knowledge, a mode of operation and links with industry and overseas colleagues and institutions to provide a range of options and answers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The lessons learnt from the Collins submarine experience have been invaluable for DSTO, which is now undertaking research to support the future submarine project and the next generation of undersea warfare, including many advanced concepts such as the potential integration of unmanned vehicles within submarines.
       </p>
       <b>
        <p>
         Developing physical employment standards
        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        DSTO is also conducting work to support our personnel through the development of new modern physical employment standards. DSTO has partnered with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wollongong" rel="nofollow">
         University of Wollongong
        </a>
        to establish a Centre of Expertise in Physical Employment Standards. This centre of expertise will assist the ADF to develop objective benchmarks for physical employment assessments to ensure soldiers have physical capacity commensurate with the performance of critical tasks, regardless of trade classifications, rank, age or gender.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         The Centre
        </a>
        has been tasked to develop physical employment standards for the Army, with a view to later assessing requirements for the Air Force and the Navy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Physical employment standards are physical fitness standards that accurately measure a person’s ability to physically perform the variety of jobs that make up the modern ADF. By defining a set of physical employment standards that represent the real demands of military tasks, Defence can ensure that all personnel have the appropriate physical capacity to safely and effectively carry out those tasks. Adoption of employment standards will also help guide recruits to occupations for which they are most physically suited and could also potentially facilitate access to occupations traditionally closed to particular groups on the basis of task physical readiness. Importantly, these new standards could also potentially contribute to significant savings for Defence as a result of lower healthcare and compensation costs by reducing trade related injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of these new standards will also help inform the government on the appropriateness of a possible expansion of the roles that women can play in the ADF. A priority of the government is to improve the recruitment and retention of women in the ADF. Women already play a very important role, including on operations such as in Afghanistan at the moment. The government recognises that it is crucial to recruit and retain more women if the ADF is to meet its overall force requirements. Defence aims to provide all its members with the opportunity to progress based on merit, ability, performance and potential in a work environment that fosters personal recognition and job satisfaction. This work will help further inform the ADF about the suitability of all people, regardless of gender, age or rank, to serve in positions throughout the ADF.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is perfectly valid to argue that all categories should be open to women. The only exceptions should be where the physical demands cannot be met, regardless of gender, according to criteria that are determined on the basis of scientific analysis rather than cultural assumptions. The government, in consultation with the broader Defence community, will consider the results upon completion in the context of possibly further expanding the roles that women can play in the ADF.
       </p>

        <p>
         Support to Acquisition
        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        On the issue in relation to the support of the DSTO to the acquisition of military material, as confirmed by David Mortimer’s report into Defence Procurement and Sustainment, titled
        <i>
         Going to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Level" rel="nofollow">
          Next Level
         </a>
        </i>
        , DSTO’s role in supporting acquisition is also vital. In close partnership with Defence’s Capability Development Group and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Materiel_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Materiel Organisation
        </a>
        , DSTO advises Defence and the government on the full spectrum of technical issues associated with platforms and equipment and on solutions that offer the best performance and best value for money. This is an integral part of the acquisition process and the capability life cycle. DSTO’s assessments ensure the technical risks of acquiring new capability are minimised. Their independent and objective advice also provides a reality check on available options for government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within the capability development process, DSTO’s feasibility studies and operational analyses are essential early inputs in determining what sort of equipment the ADF needs, and why. For example, in the recent air combat capability review, DSTO compared the relative merits of current and future combat aircraft and their ability to carry out the mix of roles required for Australia’s air defence. The capabilities of our planned air combat systems were then assessed against the projected future threats in the Asia-Pacific region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as important, DSTO also provides advice on how Australia can maintain its capability advantage through the development of leading edge technology that may not be available anywhere else in the world. Importantly, due to the risks that are associated with such developments, DSTO plays a very important risk management role in this process.
       </p>
       <p>
        As it acquires next-generation technologies the ADF will be relying more heavily on DSTO’s expertise to reduce technical risk and integrate capabilities into the force structure. The establishment of the Systems Integration Technical Advisory unit by DSTO and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMO" rel="nofollow">
         DMO
        </a>
        should go a long way towards addressing the challenges involved in integrating systems and reducing delays in the delivery of Defence projects and that is a high priority of the government.
       </p>
       <b>
        <p>
         Accident Investigation
        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        DSTO also has built up high levels of forensic skill and sophistication in military accident investigation. This has helped provide support to investigations of historical and contemporary military incidents, which not only illuminate these but also help inform current ADF doctrine and practice. The most comprehensive accident investigation carried out by DSTO in the last 20 years was its investigation of the 2005
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_King" rel="nofollow">
         Sea King
        </a>
        helicopter crash on the Indonesian island of Nias, which resulted in the tragic death of nine crew members.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DSTO investigation team conducted an analysis of the accident, with their findings used to support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         Board of Inquiry
        </a>
        . This work helped contributed to the Board of Inquiry being able to provide a full account of this incident, which in turn helped provide information to the victims’ families.
       </p>
       <p>
        This work in Indonesia was followed by another DSTO investigation resulting in the discovery three months ago of the Canberra bomber and the remains of the aircrew that went missing in Vietnam in 1970. The Air Operations Division of the DSTO provided crucial support for that investigation by analysing potential trajectories given the last known position, likely altitude and airspeed of Canberra bombers on the mission. This expertise and modelling work refined and prioritised the search area for the two missing airmen. The ensuing investigation resulted in the return last week of these two airmen, our last missing in action from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        More recently, DSTO’s contribution to the Cole Commission of Inquiry into the 1941 loss of

         Sydney
        </i>
        was a key piece of evidence that reconstructed the final hours of the ship. The evidence was a computer generated simulation based on extensive scientific models, an exhaustive analysis of video imagery and photographs of the wreck site, as well as historical documents and photographs. The simulation and analysis were crucial in recreating the most plausible scenario to resolve the mystery surrounding Australia’s biggest maritime tragedy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some years earlier, DSTO also used its underwater investigation expertise to identify and photograph the wreck of Australia’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">

         Enabling Research
        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        In order to continue to magnify the capabilities of the ADF, the DSTO invests in nurturing emerging technology and in developing new applications for existing technology. Through our white paper, the Rudd government has a forward-looking research program that focuses on a number of enabling technologies designed to deliver the maximum advantage to Defence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program is closely aligned to the ADF’s current and future operational priorities. This new program is designed to be flexible and adaptable so that promising technologies and innovative developments can be fast tracked and fielded systems can be deployed at the earliest available opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The enabling research program covers a portfolio of initiatives which span very significant research and development across challenging technology areas, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         cyber warfare;
        </li>
        <li>
         intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance;
        </li>
        <li>
         electronic warfare;
        </li>
        <li>
         over the horizon radar;
        </li>
        <li>
         antisubmarine warfare;
        </li>
        <li>
         systems integration;
        </li>
        <li>
         force protection and counter-improvised explosive devices;
        </li>
        <li>
         signatures, materials, power and energy;
        </li>
        <li>
         micro unmanned airborne systems;

        </li>
        <li>
         chemical, biological and radiological protection.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        All of these are extremely important areas of research for Australia’s future national security.

        To deliver on its research program DSTO continues to forge closer links with industry and the science and technology community both here and overseas. These links enable industry to better support the capabilities needed to defend Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Capability and Technology Demonstrator Program and the related Extension Program, both managed by DSTO, have greatly improved access for industry, especially small-to-medium enterprises, to demonstrate their innovations in technology and contribute to the development of Defence capability. Since the program started, 92 projects have been undertaken, with a total investment of approximately $224 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DSTO has had some success in developing technology in partnership with industry. A great example of this is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Direct_Attack_Munition" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ) project. The JDAM-ER is based on DSTO developed technology that was successfully licensed to industry and developed under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTD" rel="nofollow">
         CTD
        </a>
        Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a tail kit that converts free-fall unguided bombs into precision-guided weapons. The tail section contains an advanced guidance system that directs the bomb to the selected target. The key enabler that allows the guided weapon to glide towards long-range targets is the wing kit, developed by Hawker de Havilland (now Boeing Aerostructures) under the auspices of the CTD Program and based on DSTO technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        This innovative technology has increased the range of the launch aircraft’s fire-and-forget capability, allowing the launch at a safe distance from the target. This increases the safety of our pilots and other ADF personnel. The system was developed under the CTD Program and then under the new CTD Extension Program. It is now in final development for commercial production. This collaboration between DSTO and industry has led to a world-leading product and has the potential to improve the safety of ADF personnel and create jobs in high-technology occupations.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further example of collaboration around the CTD Program is the assistance it provided for the successful transition of advanced sonar communications interception technology into operational service. The Low Probability of Intercept Sonar project, developed by Nautronix (now a division of L-3), has already transitioned into service with the Navy. The technology aims to ensure that there is a low probability that underwater communications will be intercepted and/or recognised by foreign forces. This is another product that increases the capability of the ADF and improves the safety of our ADF personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further distinct form of collaboration between Defence and industry is the successful establishment of the Defence Materials Technology Centre (DMTC). The DMTC aims to leverage the expertise and resources of DSTO, industry, universities and other public research bodies to develop leading-edge materials-related technologies for the ADF.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd government intends to promote further joint ventures in high-technology areas of interest to Defence. Accordingly, DSTO will expand its engagement program with its industry and overseas partners to stay ahead of the technology curve. By collaborating with and transferring its technology to Australian industry, DSTO plays a significant role in creating jobs, generating national wealth and reducing Australia’s reliance on overseas products and expertise. This in turn helps build a stronger Australian defence industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        DSTO’s value and its credibility stem from its incorporation as an integral part of Defence, its exclusive focus on Australia’s war-fighting needs, its experience in supporting the ADF since the early 1900s and its knowledge of modern warfare based on leading-edge, highly classified research. It would be hard to find anywhere else this unique combination of research excellence, specialist knowledge of Defence needs and rigorous objectivity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The value that the 2,300 men and women of DSTO deliver to ADF capability more than justifies the two per cent of the Defence budget that the government invests in this world-class science and technology organisation. Indeed, the Rudd government is of the view that an increasingly strong and adaptable DSTO is a critical national security asset for the future. I thank the House.

         It is a delight to speak on the contribution of defence science to the security of our nation. Our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         has internationally been recognised as a defence force that punches well above its weight. Punching well above your weight does not just come from having a very well-trained and disciplined defence force; it comes from supplying the men and women of the defence force with the equipment, the platforms and the technology they need to be able to do their job effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Warfare today is significantly different to the warfare conducted just a few decades ago. Not only have there been fewer state-versus-state conflicts across the globe but we have witnessed a phenomenal increase in asymmetric warfare and in those willing to use such warfare for their own purposes. Too often the symbolic date of 9-11 is referred to as being the start of terrorist campaigns and asymmetric warfare, but I think it goes back to the days of Lockerbie, which has been in the news recently, and the advent of terrorism using whatever means necessary to bring about disruption, downfall of government and financial strains on countries and to instil fear into communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Aside from the strategic shift in the way warfare is now conducted and the manner in which defence forces now have to plan for future conflicts, there has also been a very rapid advancement in defence technologies to support those efforts. Developing technologies in rapid response to the new and emerging threats is key and critical. For example, new warfare means that have strongly emerged in particular since the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have been improvised explosive devices, and the face and the nature of those devices have changed from being very small and very basic military equipment to now incorporating high technology—the use of mobile phones planted in the devices to set off charges. It is important is that the science addresses those emerging threats.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have talked about the fine scientific minds in our nation, but unlike years gone by, where our top scientific minds would sit in a laboratory testing, developing and checking, these fine minds now serve on the front line with Australia’s finest soldiers, sailors and airmen witnessing, experiencing and looking at these technologies so they can provide instant response, taking that science and putting it straight back into the laboratory so their colleagues can work on new and innovative ways of addressing threats which would not only take the lives of Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen but also the lives of innocent victims, innocent players, in the pursuit of terrorism driven by those with ulterior means and motives to destroy everything we stand for in the way of democracy, freedoms and the ability of people to go about their life by peaceful means. So the science of warfare is as important as those who go out into the field to prosecute the arguments of warfare to reduce terrorism. Making sure, though, that these people have the tools and the resources necessary to conduct the science that brings about speedy resolution is key and critical.
        </p>
        <p>
         I congratulate the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, Mr Combet, on his speech today. It was a great rundown through the history of all of the accomplishments over the decades of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Science" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Science
         </a>
         Technology Organisation and the great people who have worked there. Some of Australia’s leading minds have worked there. In fact, one of our own colleagues
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Jensen" rel="nofollow">
          Dennis Jensen
         </a>
         was a scientist at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
          DSTO
         </a>
         working on the submarine project. So many people from many fields work there and we need to make sure that we as a nation keep investing in the people who can bring about these opportunities, this science and this technology.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many people amongst the 2,300 scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians, the new and emerging area of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
          IT
         </a>
         specialists and support staff who work for DSTO. As I have travelled around Australia to the various DSTO outfits, I have met these people and they are some of perhaps the most enthusiastic people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Without being rude or dismissive of them, they are perhaps some of the most anal people I have ever met. They are so focused on the job that they have to do that everything else is immaterial. They are so fixated on achieving the outcome because they know that if they achieve that outcome they are going to save lives. It is not just about tinkering with machines and information. Their focus is on saving lives, not only the lives of our Defence personnel but also the lives of innocent people who are the victims of terrorism.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
          If I
         </a>
         were to use a more polite word—and I meant no disrespect to them individually or as a group—they are perhaps some of the most excited people I have ever met. The way they talk about their inventions, their creations and their value adding to technology cannot help but inspire you in looking at what they do, and their dedication to their work, their attitude, is due in no small part to the fact that they understand the uniqueness and the importance of the work that they conduct. There may be people who have great minds and have great ability but who perhaps are not prepared to engage in developing defence technologies for the benefit of our nation and our allies, but their contribution can be equally supportive in an indirect way.
        </p>
        <p>
         The speech just given by Minister Combet on the work undertaken by DSTO and their achievements, their support of our Defence Force and industry sectors is truly welcome. For most people, the work of DSTO is not really known out there in the general public. It is almost like they are the secret service—the service that people do not know exists—but they understand the outcomes that DSTO achieve, and they achieve it on a very tight budget. This is a group of scientists, 2,300 people, who achieve a lot for the amount of money that is invested in them. I will not revisit all of the scientific breakthroughs that have been covered by the minister, but one in particular that I have had a look at when I was out on a ship it was on is the Nulka ship launch missile countermeasure device which is designed to act as a decoy to incoming radar guided antiship missiles.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are a relatively small nation and as such we have a reasonably sized defence force and a reasonably sized armada of ships. Over the next couple of decades we will see an expansion of those ships with new warfare destroyers. We will see an upgrading of our ships, but making sure that they have a survivability at sea is key and critical. One cannot just walk in and buy things off the shelf. They take years of design and development and our Defence Force people on those ships are the most important assets that we have in our Defence Force. Platforms and bits of metal are one thing, but it is our people who are the most important. So an instrument like a Nulka—a decoy which will take a radar guided missile away from the ship, thereby protecting the asset and protecting the personnel—is a very important piece of design technology created in Australia. The Nulka is now in use with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Navy
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         Navy. Here is where our science has developed technology which is able to be exported to our allies. Australia again is at the forefront of technology and doing what it can not just for our people but for our allies who serve alongside us. Science technology can earn massive amounts of money for Australia, but as the minister rightly said it can save a lot of money for Australia as well. One example that he identified very close to me at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         Base Williamtown is the cost savings in excess of $400 million by, through science, extending the life structure of the centre barrel for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA" rel="nofollow">
          FA
         </a>
         18.
        </p>
        <p>
         This fleet was thought to have reached a critical point in its fatigue structure. Through scientific testing they were able to extend the life of that, which fits in better with our platform procurement, whether it is through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hornets" rel="nofollow">
          Super Hornets
         </a>
         or indeed the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Strike_Fighter" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Strike Fighter
         </a>
         , and extends their lives. By extending their lives, we save money. It is not something that you can just enter into. It is not done through guessometrics because people fly these platforms and you cannot put people’s lives at undue risk, so the science, the research and the technical correctness is very critical. Importantly, through proper funding we can achieve even greater savings and understanding of defence technologies through the science.
        </p>
        <p>
         The DSTO has been very important in investigating the development of physical employment standards for Australian Defence Force personnel. The development of such standards will produce rigorous scientific standards for employment categories in the ADF and may potentially open up new avenues of employment for women. The coalition is committed to increasing opportunities for women in the Australian Defence Force. It is not just rhetoric; it is action. I note that my colleague the former Minister for Defence,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
          Brendan Nelson
         </a>
         , is here today. He was one of the key drivers in creating equality of opportunity for all people in Australia to serve our nation in a variety of capacities. Through this program we will see opportunities open up. We will see that people, because of their commitment, because of their courage, will be able to serve Australia and its needs in theatres of operation to the best of their ability. In designing these standards we are putting people with capacity into the right placements to achieve the maximum outcome. This is good stuff for Australia, and it is good for the people in our defence forces to know that there are designs around their capability to make sure that they can have maximum impact.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the other science improvements that I witnessed at DSTO was at the forefront of air-to-air missile technology. They provided substantial expertise, in conjunction with our RAAF, in developing the lock-after-launch
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRAAM" rel="nofollow">
          ASRAAM
         </a>
         missile capability. This capability was developed so that the ASRAAM missile can be fired at an enemy aircraft that is flying behind an engaged aircraft. Having talked to the RAAF pilots at Williamtown, I know that this is important technology. To manoeuvre your aircraft in such a way that you can do a loop over the back and engage a missile or indeed an aircraft that is pursuing you in a dogfight is very difficult—no matter what the platform. Australian science has developed the ASRAAM missile, which can be deployed and locked on after launch to an aircraft or a missile that is following an aircraft, therefore protecting Australian lives and allowing us to go further and deeper into areas of operation to prosecute the arguments that we ask our Defence Force people to do for us.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is good technology, designed and developed by Australians, and it is technology that is now proven. I have been informed by DSTO that this lock-after-launch ASRAAM missile has the capability of picking up a missile five kilometres away, when it is pursuing an aircraft, and taking it out of operation. The work undertaken by the DSTO is invaluable. It is invaluable because it not only helps to protect our troops and ADF personnel in the front line but also helps save the Australia taxpayer a considerable amount of money and, most importantly, continues to help Australia to maintain its military technology edge.
        </p>
        <p>
         The speech given by my opposite number has served two purposes today. First, it has served to highlight to the public the exceptional work that DSTO has been engaged in, and I must stress that their work is invaluable. As I said, DSTO’s work not only supports our troops today but, critically, will ensure our technological edge into the future. However, the minister has also used this statement in an attempt to gloss over his government’s shameless acts of cutting funding from Australia’s premier research institutions such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSTO" rel="nofollow">
          ANSTO
         </a>
         and DSTO. He should be ashamed of himself for politicising the genuine good work of DSTO. Just when we thought that the politicisation of defence had come to an end with the dismissal of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
          Joel Fitzgibbon
         </a>
         , I stand here today growing increasingly concerned with the direction in which this minister is taking defence. While the minister was happy to speak about the successes of DSTO and the good work of its many scientists, engineers and researchers, he conveniently forgot—or, more accurately, deliberately omitted—certain information about his government’s policies that have cut funding for DSTO and, by extension, joint DSTO and industry programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am reminded of the Treasurer’s budget night speech where he decided to announce the government’s spending initiatives while deliberately omitting anything to do with national debt. It is unfortunate that Minister Combet has decided to submit to the Rudd Labor government’s policy of ‘spin over substance’. It is a decision that will ultimately be to the detriment of DSTO and our serving men and women. For the record, the Rudd Labor government has implemented a program that will see a significant reduction to DSTO staffing levels and their budget. Despite the minister’s rhetoric about the importance of DSTO, he is overseeing policies that will see DSTO’s budget cut by more than $108 million over the next 10 years. The minister stands here talking about the fine work that they have done but there is not a mention of the budget cuts over the next 10 years. This is only small compared to the $20 billion of cuts being implemented by the Rudd Labor government broadly across defence.

          <p>
           Minister, there are $20 billion worth of cuts. You can play smoke and mirrors, you can spin all you like, but $20 billion worth of cuts is $20 billion worth of cuts. A dollar is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar, and you should know that.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to talk about the proactive nature of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
            DSTO
           </a>
           and the importance of that. We can remind ourselves of the experience with the Collins class submarines, which the minister has pointed out to this House, but can I also remind him of the fact that cutbacks to DSTO by the former Labor government actually impeded the due diligence on the science and technology on projects like
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JORN" rel="nofollow">
            JORN
           </a>
           and the Collins class submarine. I say one thing to the minister: proactive due diligence in scientific and engineering assessment is a lot cheaper than rectification work. Rectification is very expensive. So I say to this minister: forget about the cutbacks. If you are talking about the opportunities for science and technology for Australia in defence then actually increase their budget, and the savings will come because there will not be the rectification costs. Because of the due diligence as we take first of line and develop new and emerging technologies, the costs will not be there in rectification.
          </p>
          <p>
           So where do I see this playing out firsthand? One of the first operations of this government was through DSTO’s capability and technology demonstrator fund. One of the first painful cuts was taking their budget from around $26 million annually down to $13 million. This is a program that develops new technology and gets small-to-medium enterprises working hand in hand and reduces the risk profile for those small businesses. Some of the best military technologies in the world have been developed by small-to-medium enterprises—people with a vision, an idea and a dream looking for support to be able to implement that technology. A lot of that technology cannot be taken to the marketplace because it is defence-style work. You cannot just build it, put it on the shelf and hope somebody will come and buy it. If you are designing technology which is for defence, you need to work hand in hand with defence science and technology to make sure it fits their needs. Once that product or technology is developed there is a market for it, and the secrecy and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP" rel="nofollow">
            IP
           </a>
           are protected because it has been developed in cooperation with government. The minister talks gloatingly about all the projects that have been developed and funded through this capability technology demonstrator fund. I say to him that the $13 million a year in cutbacks, halving the project, will see a massive reduction.

           The minister has made a lot of statements in his speech about the Collins-class submarine and developing physical employment standards. In a previous life, he stood up for workers and, in particular, for occupational health and safety for workers. I remind him that cadmium has been found in the Collins-class submarine. It was identified 12 months ago, in August 2008, and it has taken till now to put safety warning signs on those submarines. I need to be clear on this. The issue is not the fact that cadmium is present on the submarines. Cadmium is required in the electrical equipment to reduce corrosion and make sure that the sustainability of the equipment continues. The issue here is one of occupational health and safety, where people are advised of the problem so they can wear personal protective equipment to protect themselves. This is the minister who made much, and rightly so, of

           and the need for companies like James Hardie to implement occupational health and safety standards for the protection and welfare of their workers. This minister was previously the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement. This is an occupational health and safety issue which is of paramount importance to people who are submerged in a submarine for extended periods of time. They cannot leave the submarine. They have to breathe the air that is pumped around the submarine. They cannot walk away. They cannot go outside. They cannot go for a swim. They cannot go down the street. They do not have weekends off but are in there 24/7. And here is the man who took 12 months to put up a sign. I would hate to see what is going to happen if there is a large task that he has to undertake other than making sure that signs are put up to make people aware of the danger and threat of the cadmium in the equipment in these submarines.

           Minister, you have now had a few days. I hope that you have actually put the call through to make sure that those signs are established on those submarines. It should not be too hard to get the signs on the submarines, because most of them are in port. They are in port because, in 22 months, you have not increased the manning levels to increase the capacity of our submarines to go to sea and you have not applied the funding to the engineering to make sure that our submarines can go to sea. The

           audit in 2008 showed a shortfall of 240 submariners to meet the current demand for a full complement of 667. The reality is that the ANAO audit showed that our submarines are operating at 43 per cent of capacity. So I say to you: your snail’s pace in delivering reform programs is not like the

             . It is just a pity you have not stood up for the sailors of this nation on our submarines.

             In conclusion, I want to say this. Our Defence Force, as I said right at the very beginning, punch well above their weight on an international scale, as is recognised by our allies across the world. But that ability to punch well above their weight comes not just from their own training standards and, in particular, their discipline; it comes from the technologies and the platforms that we provide to our people. A lot of that development and technology is Australian home grown. Minister, take this message on board: your cutbacks of $20 billion over 10 years—$2 billion per annum—will have dire effects on our Defence Force. They are already having effects on the morale of our Defence Force. I urge you, even if do not you have the capacity to lobby your own government to restore all of that funding, to make sure the funding for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
              DSTO
             </a>
             is restored and that it is actually increased. You have come into the House today and enunciated all of the great work that they have done but you have failed to back that up with dollars. Make sure they have the funding to continue to provide the new and emerging technologies that are needed, in the face of the emerging threats and technologies that our enemies are developing, so that our Defence Force can be protected and the lives of the people they go out to protect are also protected. Minister, if you do not do that, you have failed our nation.
