        As is well known, mental health conditions affect every sector of society, every age group and every community. As has also been frequently highlighted through numerous surveys and research, mental health wellbeing is a primary concern amongst young people, where depression, eating disorders, drug abuse, aggressive behaviours, psychosis and suicidal thoughts are all too prevalent. Despite the many intervention programs initiated by governments, schools, sports clubs, employers and others, one in four young adults reportedly deal with some form of mental health problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, one community group that is making a positive difference in helping young people with mental health issues is Talk

        </a>
        , otherwise known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOL" rel="nofollow">
         TOL
        </a>
        . Established in 2016 by its founder, Mary Galouzis, and relying on sponsors, local fundraising and government and community grants, Talk Out Loud has now established a base in

        and another in Salisbury. Each month over 300 young people use the Talk Out Loud facilities for a diverse range of activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday evening I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        of Talk Out Loud, where we were provided with an update of their work over the past year, when COVID not only added to mental health issues but also impacted on community interactions and programs. COVID did not, however, dampen the work of Talk Out Loud, which to date has, through counselling services, school programs and recreational activities, run 27 youth empowerment camps, made presentations to around 5,000 people in school and community groups, and individually interacted with over 840 people. All the programs are organised by dedicated volunteers, some whom were recognised at last Friday's AGM. We also heard a very traumatic personal story of a young person who has benefited from her association with Talk Out Loud and is now a volunteer with the organisation. This was of course just one of the examples of how Talk Out Loud is changing lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to commend and to thank the Talk Out Loud leadership group and committee members, the many volunteers and their sponsors for their extra rework for helping young people and their families get through some of the very difficult issues in their lives from time to time. Talk Out Loud is a wonderful example of how a community-led initiative can do so much for so many.
