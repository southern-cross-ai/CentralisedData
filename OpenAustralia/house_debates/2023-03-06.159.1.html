       <p>
        Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The Australian government is committed to providing practical services and support for defence personnel, veterans and families, and we're delivering. In December I had the opportunity to open two new veterans and families hubs: one in Nowra, led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        LifeCare, alongside my colleague the member for Gilmore; and one in Wodonga, led by RSL Victoria, alongside the member for Indi. Now, those local veteran communities can access tailored services, including support for transition to civilian life; advocacy services and social connectedness; physical and mental health services; and a range of community activities including volunteer and sporting opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal budget handed down in October includes $46.7 million to deliver 10 veterans and families hubs across the country to improve access to the specific services and supports that local veteran communities need and, frankly, deserve. In January I announced the lead organisation for the new Burnie veterans and families hub, the North West Tasmania Veteran Welfare Board. In Caboolture, I announced Lives Lived Well will bring their mental and physical health expertise to a hub to support veterans in Brisbane's north and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        , in conjunction with the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia (Queensland Branch).
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also been travelling the country meeting with veteran communities on the next round of hubs. We know that each local community is different. What works at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        House in Perth now is different to what is needed at the Oasis in Townsville. We're taking that principle forward in these new hubs. We do not want a cookie-cutter approach. And the feedback we've been getting around the country reflects that. I will name a few key takeaways. Veterans in the Tweed, which I visited with the member for Richmond, want to be sure that, no matter what side of the border someone lives, whether it's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        or Queensland, there will be easy access to the hub and the services it will provide for locals across the region. Meanwhile, in the defence-industry-heavy Newcastle and Hunter region, which I visited with the member for Paterson, there was a fantastic acknowledgement that veterans in the defence industry continue to contribute to the sovereign capability of our nation. They want to be sure that the hub supports more veterans into employment. Veterans in Ipswich, which I visited with the member for Blair, want a safe place that's welcoming for veterans and families of all ages, something that we want for all hubs. In Torquay, which I visited with the member for Corangamite, the veteran community spoke of the need for ease of access to the hub itself and for the services that it could provide to the wider region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to the Defence personnel, veterans, families and ex-service organisations around the country that have been so generous with their time, contributing to consultation sessions about the new hubs set to pop up around the country. With this and other engagements, I've also been able to speak with a broad cross-section of veterans about the Albanese government's Veterans' Legislation Reform Consultation Pathway. I can't wait to see what we can achieve together for a better future for our veterans and families.
