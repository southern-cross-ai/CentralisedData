        I wish to speak this morning about Zanthorrea Nursery in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maida_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Maida Vale
        </a>
        in my electorate of Hasluck which was recently declared the first sustainable garden centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . I was very pleased to have the opportunity to support Senator Eric Abetz, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, when we presented the owners, Jackie and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Hooper" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , with their certification. The staff at Zanthorrea have undergone training on sustainable garden practices, which include such things as water efficiency in the garden, avoiding environmental weeds, using fertilisers wisely, using plant care chemicals that are safe and selecting native plants that support wildlife. Zanthorrea staff are able to give assistance and advice on all of these important practices to ensure sustainable gardens in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the proactive support of nurseries such as Zanthorrea and owners Jackie and Alec Hooper, gardeners are now using fewer chemicals and preferring organic gardening methods. Their staff have been trained to provide advice on getting the best results out of fertilisers and chemicals for plant care if there is no natural alternative. Overfertilisation is a common problem which results in these nutrients being flushed into stormwater drains and ultimately contaminating our river systems and waterways. Unfortunately, the upper reaches of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River" rel="nofollow">
         Swan River
        </a>
        suffer from algal blooms each year, so the role we each play in reducing the nutrient run-off is very welcome. As part of their certification, Zanthorrea Nursery is independently audited and applies the environmental code of practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sustainable garden project initially started in Victoria with a small group of passionate gardeners to make small changes to the way we garden. I hope that the many keen gardeners of Hasluck will visit the Zanthorrea Nursery and see changes that they can incorporate in their own backyards. I am sure that once other garden centres become aware of this very sensible program there will be a number of certified sustainable garden centres across Australia. This project was funded under the federal government’s $44 million Defeating the Weed Menace Program. Sustainable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Gardening Australia
        </a>
        provides a sensible approach to practical gardening which results in environmentally friendly gardens that are also easier to maintain. Zanthorrea’s approach is consistent with that; in fact, in their newsletter they say, ‘At Zanthorrea we are committed to promoting native plants.’ This certification and award demonstrate that very clearly. They are about creating healthy, thriving gardens, working with nature.
