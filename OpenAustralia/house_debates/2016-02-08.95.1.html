        Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fit-out of new leased premises for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        located in Gosford,

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On 13 May 2014, the then Treasurer announced that the government would open a new building on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Central Coast
        </a>
        for 600 Commonwealth employees. The Australian Taxation Office was named as the lead agency for this initiative aimed to boost employment and investment in the region. To achieve this outcome, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        proposes to commission an integrated fit-out of the new 7,350 square metre building at 20 Mann Street, Gosford, consisting of a lower ground floor, ground floor and levels 1 and 2. The new purpose-built Commonwealth office will support modern work practices and provide the ATO with the opportunity to develop a future-ready site aligned with the ATO's reinvention program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, the new premises will reflect the changing environment in which the ATO operates and provide contemporary, flexible and cost-effective accommodation within the region. The proposed fit-out includes modular work points, collaborative spaces, security systems, enhanced conference rooms, training and videoconferencing facilities, future-ready
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        infrastructure, end-of-trip facilities to support staff wellbeing and shopfront facilities to support government agencies and their clients. Additionally, the new building provides an opportunity to strengthen the ATO's commitment to serving and engaging with regional areas, allowing the community to interact in person with the ATO. The estimated cost of the fit-out is $20.8 million excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        and includes all costs associated with the delivery of the project including provisions for contingencies, cost escalation and professional fees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the fit-out, the developer will commence base building work on the site in August 2016. The proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in July 2017 and be completed by November 2017. I commend the motion to the House.
