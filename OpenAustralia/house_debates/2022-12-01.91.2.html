         (â€”) (): I would like to thank the member for Chisholm for that question. I know she has been advocating for cost-of-living relief as a key priority across her electorate. At the Jobs and Skills Summit in September, we as a government said we would deliver more incentives for pensioners to take up more work and help with labour shortages. I am very pleased to inform the House today that we have delivered. Age pensioners can now earn more without affecting their pension.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, the Albanese Labor government's $4,000 work bonus income boost has come into effect. We are making this process easier for pensioners. They won't need to do a thing. This temporary increase will automatically be credited to eligible work bonus income banks upfront, so they will be able to earn an additional $4,000 from employment income up to 31 December. This change gives more flexibility to those who are already working to take up extra work. We know a lot of pensioners want to enjoy their retirement and don't want to do that extra work. But, for those that do, this immediate top-up to the work bonus income comes at a great time for those wanting to take up some short-term seasonal work, particularly those that want to bring some Christmas cheer to young children in shopping centres all around Australia. This is just one of the measures that this government has delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
         We said we would ease the cost-of-living pressures and help older Australians keep more money in their pockets. In the lead-up to the election, we said we would freeze the social security deeming rates. We have delivered on this, freezing them at their current rate for two years to 30 June 2024. This will protect around 900,000 age pensioners and other pension recipients from the impact that deeming rates can have on their pension rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last month, we passed legislation to increase the income limits for those on the Commonwealth seniors health card, extending access to an additional 50,000 self-funded retirees, who will benefit from cheaper access to medicines and health care. In just the first two weeks, I am really pleased to report to the House that we saw around 10,000 senior Australians put in their application for one of these cards, a pleasing uptick in the numbers compared to the previous period.
        </p>
        <p>
         We said we would deliver cost-of-living relief, and we have. We have also delivered on our commitment to make it easier for pensioners selling and buying a new home, with our legislation on downsizing going through the parliament. We are delivering tangible help for older Australians to help them get by in times when the cost of living and other challenges are making it difficult for them. Older Australians have worked hard; they deserve a government that will deliver for them, and that's what we are doing.
