        My question is to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is providing income and other support to those Australians affected by natural disasters?

         I thank the Government Whip for her question and thank her for all her hard work during the very difficult times her state has experienced with fires recently. It's interesting to reflect that this time last year Services Australia in its previous guise, Human Services, received over 120,000 calls for assistance during the devastating
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         floods and the Morrison government paid out, quickly and efficiently, over $120 million to those affected. So far this bushfire season the response from this government has been that and moreâ€”from working seven days a week to keep the 1802266 line open, so people can seek assistance after hours and on weekends, to connecting 1,362 residents to counselling and mental health support, working to keep all walk-in service centres in affected areas operational when required and, of course, working alongside the ADF to reach isolated communities where support has been most needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, up until last night, since 16 September, when the first fires began, Services Australia has received over 156,000 calls. To date, 86,989 disaster relief payments have been made, amounting to over $102 million. In addition, over 40,000 children have received the $400 extra, with $16 million paid. That's $118 million this government has paid out rapidly to Australians in need. Ninety-nine per cent of all claims are finalised over the phone in person with an average speed of answering in the seconds. The average Australian is on the phone for no more than about 15 minutes and they are paid those funds within 30 minutes for the most part, if, indeed, their bank is connected to the new payment platform. On this note, can I call out to our banks who have not yet implemented the new payment platform to get a wriggle on. For those whose bank is actually using the new payment platform, you're paid in minutes. For those whose banks aren't, the bank requires a payment overnight.

We've also built and deployed 20 mobile service teams who have worked with portable technology on the ground and have made over 400 visits to 140 distinct locations, working with the ADF and deploying by armoured vehicle, helicopter or on foot. Services Australia will continue to work to meet with the most vulnerable and the most needy. I thank the House and all its members for all their support over a difficult season.
