       <p>
        I rise tonight to pay tribute to our incredible veterans community in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . As a community it is incredibly important that we continue to honour the service and sacrifice of the men and women who have served and continue to serve in the defence of our country. At present, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        supports more than 290,000 Australians, including more than 2,400 in my electorate of Robertson, so it was fantastic to hear the comments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in parliament recently—including the ministerial statement on veterans and their families. The minister gave a commitment to three key areas, which are worth emphasising now: firstly, a standalone Department of Veterans' Affairs; secondly, a department that focuses on the needs of the veteran first; and, thirdly, a stronger voice for the veterans community—which I can also commit to for veterans in my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise the importance of veterans' health. Part of the process is about raising awareness, for example through Veterans' Health Week in October, which has the theme of 'physical health'. But there's also a role for the government to assist. Last year, the Turnbull government committed to providing veterans with free and immediate mental health treatment. In this year's budget the scheme was expanded to cover all mental health conditions, meaning that any veteran of the full-time ADF will have access to free and immediate mental health cover. This is considered the biggest change in veterans policy in decades. But we must continue to build on it—such as through the investment of $9.8 million to pilot new approaches to suicide prevention and to improve the care and support available to veterans. This will include funding to increase support for those discharging from hospital and who are at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        These issues and more were raised with me just last weekend at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettalong_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Ettalong Beach
        </a>
        at the service for our Vietnam veterans, which was well attended by a cross-section of our Central Coast community. It was, as always, an incredible honour to attend the annual march and ceremony along the Ettalong foreshore, and to lay a wreath in remembrance. Much of the advocacy for veterans in this area is done by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam Veterans
        </a>
        , Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association of Australia, Central Coast Sub-branch. I'm pleased to be able to announce that the sub-branch has received more than $17,000 to help cover some of the costs of their Ettalong office. This funding will be delivered through the Building Excellence in Support and Training, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEST" rel="nofollow">
         BEST
        </a>
        , grants. The BEST program helps provide support for our veteran organisations that assist the community through pensions, advocacy and welfare work.

        </a>
        Sub-branch will also benefit from the latest round of the BEST grants. The sub-branch has received more than $6,000 to contribute to the costs associated with its veterans advocacy services, which is great news for veterans associated with the hard work, service and support that happens every day around the peninsula. As part of the latest round of BEST funding, Brisbane Water Legacy has also received more than $10,000. Peter Lawley, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , told me that in the case of Brisbane Water Legacy the grant will help support staff in preparing all the paperwork for applications for war widows pension claims for recently widowed individuals. Peter said that the assistance means they will be able to help those dealing with the confusion and stress of suffering from the loss of a loved one by ensuring they have the support they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        This comes at a very good time for Legacy, too, with next Sunday 24 August the start of Legacy Week around Australia. Legacy Week aims to raise funds to assist around 70,000 widows Australia-wide, including nearly 2,000 on the Central Coast. During Legacy Week, I'll host a roundtable for veterans from across the electorate in my office to hear their stories, listen to their concerns and be able to better advocate on their behalf. I look forward to meeting and hearing from representatives across our electorate and listening to how we can best support those who need help the most.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to recognise veterans groups across our electorate who do so much each and every day. These organisations include the Vietnam Veterans, Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association of Australia, Central Coast Sub-branch, at Ettalong; Gosford RSL Sub-branch; the Terrigal-Wamberal RSL Sub-branch; Veterans Plus; Gosford's 311 Squadron of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Air_Force_Cadets" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; Brisbane Water Legacy; the Central Coast subsection of the Naval Association of Australia; the Central Coast Interactive War Exhibit; Davistown RSL Sub-branch; Partners of Veterans Association Central Coast Sub-branch, and the New South Wales National Servicemen's Association &amp; Affiliates Incorporated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to each and every organisation—and individual—that works so hard to ensure that veterans and their families continue to be supported. Thank you for all that you do for our community.
