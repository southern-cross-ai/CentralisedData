       <p>
        There are days in our communities where we stand back and are overwhelmed with pride for the people we represent. Saturday was one such day for me. I attended the Werribee Hockey Club to open its Land of Legends memorabilia room, which came about from funding from the Stronger Communities Fund. This club turned a $5,000 grant into a room full of memorabilia. It was a stunning thing. But what most impressed me at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Tigers" rel="nofollow">
         Werribee Tigers
        </a>
        on Saturday was that it was fair-go round. They were an inaugural club in Victoria's fair go many years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        I watched the men's hockey team playing in their rainbow socks and I was so proud of my community. I was so proud that they understand diversity, that they understand inclusivity. When I left, the players gave me rainbow socks to bring to parliament. They, like me, were hoping against hope that this week we'd get a free vote in the parliament to make marriage equality a reality on the ground in our country. They will be disappointed in that. They will be disappointed because $122 million would go a long way for Werribee Hockey Club. They could have a new pitch. The footy club could have a new oval. That $122 million would mean a lot. And $122 million on a non-binding plebiscite is an absolute waste of money according to the people in my community.
