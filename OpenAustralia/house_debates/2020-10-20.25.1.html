        Sandringham station and the Sandy line need more commuter car parking, not less. At the last election, the Morrison government funded the $3.1 million Sandy station parking upgrade for an additional 100 spots, a plan put forward by Bayside City Council. It was part of our $24.5 million commitment to do so at numerous railway stations across Goldstein. At Bentleigh and Elsternwick, plans are well underway, with the support of the

        . Plans are being advanced by the state government for north Brighton and Hampton. At Brighton beach, the soil is too sandy to take additional weight.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's disappointing is not only that the state government is blocking development at Sandy station; it's its next plans. At a meeting at 4 pm on Monday 16 December 2019 with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Bayside and the mayor, Councillor Clarke Martin, he advised me the state government opposed development at Sandy station so they had the option to remove existing commuter parking so that the land could be used for rolling stock. The state government isn't opposing new parking at Sandy station; they're supporting less, and, in practice, none.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before COVID-19, Sandy station was already packed. Commuters and nearby residents desperately need additional parking. This demand will return. Bayside should be continuing to support additional car parking at Sandy station, and the state government should not be planning to take away what little parking there already is.
