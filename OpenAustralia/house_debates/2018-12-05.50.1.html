        But it's not surprising to see that those on the other side don't really understand and have a bit of an awkward relationship with the truth, because I want to draw the chamber's attention to the concept of a conflict of interest. It is a situation in which a person is in a position to derive a personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity. I saw in the paper today that the member for Fadden is apparently going to announce that there will be a task force review into the concept of what is meant by 'Australian made' and 'made in Australia'.

         On a point of order, I'd ask that that comment be withdrawn. It reflects on the member in a way that is not supported by the standing orders.
