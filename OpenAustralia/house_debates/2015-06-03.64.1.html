         It is a delight to take a question from my neighbour in rural
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         the member for Hume. I thank him for his intelligent contribution to public policy in health. There are no intelligent contributions from the Labor Party—but more of that in a minute. I want to reinforce the Abbott government's investment in health in this budget; it will increase to a total of $69.7 billion in 2015-16, an increase of $3.2 billion on last year. Our investment in Medicare continues to grow—to over $21 billion—with our cornerstone Medicare policies around the review of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
          MBS
         </a>
         , with 5,500 items. It is an ambitious task but we will create a Medicare schedule that reflects contemporary practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our investment in primary care, including mental health, will see new approaches and new funding models for complex and chronic disease. We are undertaking sensible reforms. There is $26 million to add incentives to immunise. We know how important that is. We have a new national diabetes strategy. We are cleaning up Labor's e-health mess—a billion dollars and where have we got to? Less than 10 per cent of the population are signed onto a health record. We are, of course, investing strongly in the PBS, with $10 billion this year alone, including the budget announcement of $1.3 billion on new drugs for melanoma, breast cancer, blindness and shingles. And I announced on the weekend a further $60 million for a drug that treats lung cancer. Despite Labor's claims, total annual hospital funding is up by 25 per cent over the next four years, or $3.8 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are record levels of spending in health. This is a government that has a plan for health. I am waiting for the opposition, in the 'year of big ideas'. There were three key speeches. In the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech, health was not mentioned. In the shadow Treasurer's speech at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
          Press Club
         </a>
         , there was no mention of health. And then, at the AMA conference, I waited for the shadow minister for health to apologise for the comment by her predecessor, the member for Sydney, that 'doctors earn enough and they can suck up a rebate freeze'. But she did not apologise to the doctors and she did not announce any health policy either. But then I found this gem from her: 'The opposition would be kidding itself if it did not recognise there were challenges in the budget, that savings need to be found and no area is going to be exempt.'

          Madam Speaker, on a point of order: you have previously ruled that it is in order for a minister to be asked about alternatives, but where a minister has not been asked about alternatives, it is not in order for the minister to go there.

            It is clear that Labor's policy, or non-policy, in this 'year of no ideas' is simple: they must be cutting hospitals, health, Medicare and medicines because, as the shadow minister said, no area is exempt from their savings cuts.
