        It was some time ago now that I partnered with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Something" rel="nofollow">
         Do Something
        </a>
        Near You, to launch a website making it easier for people to volunteer locally. This is a fantastic initiative, especially in my electorate of Forde where we have a large number of community organisations and groups that rely on local volunteers. Do Something Near You helps locals sign up for the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        or local volunteer fire service. They can also help out at the local charity op shop, volunteer for local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meals_On_Wheels" rel="nofollow">
         Meals On Wheels
        </a>
        , join the local Rotary or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        , or help out with a myriad of other community programs. Locals can also find out how to get involved in events such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        , Daffodil Day, National Tree Day, the Red Shield Appeal and much more. It would be great to see more local people take part in such events. I would like to see more locals connecting with our local community organisations through the Do Something Near You portal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to also acknowledge the Twin Rivers Food Co-op in Eagleby. The co-op recently extended their trading hours due to demand from within the communityâ€”those who rely on low-cost groceries to get by. I would also like to thank the co-op's Work for the Dole participants for the terrific job they are doing in contributing to such a great organisation and helping thousands of local people in the electorate of Forde.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other community organisations, such as our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        s and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs
        </a>
        , also count on volunteers to deliver their community events. We have some terrific annual community events in Forde that enormously rely on those local volunteers' contribution. For example, the Beenleigh Cane Festival, which is run by the Rotary Club of Beenleigh; the Ormeau Fair, which is organised by the Ormeau Lions Club; and the Eagleby Festival, which is run by the Eagleby Community Association. Thousands of local people would not be able to enjoy these events, or receive the community support that they do, if it was not for our volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a tremendous community with enormous pride and it is largely thanks to the local people who give their time to others that this is realised. The greatest gift you can give someone is your time, because when you give your time you are giving a portion of your life that you will never get back. It is well worth it though, and volunteering can be enormously rewarding.
       </p>
