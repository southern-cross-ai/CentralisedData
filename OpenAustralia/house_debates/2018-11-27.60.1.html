        My question is also to the Minister for Women. Does the minister agree with herself that this Liberal government is widely seen as, 'Homophobic, antiwomen, climate change deniers'? Does she also agree with the Independent member, the member for Chisholm, who told the House earlier today, 'Equal representation of men and women in this parliament is an urgent imperative which will create culture change'?

         I thank the member for her question and I would very much encourage her to read the Women's Economic Security Statement, which will tell her more about what we are doing for Australian women than all of Labor's promises. They are all talk but very short on delivery.

           It's a very popular choice. Under our government, we will create the pathway for women's economic empowerment. We genuinely want to see women be able to build their financial security. Not only do we want to see women safe in their communities, in their home, online and also in their workplaces, but we want so much more for Australian women. We want them to have an equal stake in our economy and in our society. It's one of the reasons—

               Those opposite refuse to support our government measures in the Senate that would help Australian women. We have measures in the Senate right now that they could vote for that would help secure the financial future of Australian women, particularly those women who are about to retire, because we would put limits on the fees and charges that could be applied to low-balance accounts. Those are low-balance accounts that the member opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, uncapped when he was the minister responsible, seeing so many superannuation balances brought to zero as a result. We would stop the rorts and rip-offs of the superannuation system that would see people defaulted into insurance premiums that they either do not want or do not need. We are ensuring that Australian women can build their financial future to save for their retirement with catch-up contributions in superannuation. We're levelling the playing field so that all women, no matter how they're employed, can make a tax deductible contribution to their superannuation. Yet those opposite would scrap both of those measures.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those opposite also have a mega retirees tax. Let's not forget that their mega retirees tax would impact on 30 per cent more women as a result. Their tax would hurt vulnerable women. So, despite all of their talk about how much they care for Australian women, they have no runs on the board. We do. I commend to them that they read it.
