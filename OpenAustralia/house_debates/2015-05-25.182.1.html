       <p>
        Last week was a wonderful week for us in the Deakin electorate. We had the opportunity to celebrate some wonderful local small business stories. The Minister for

        ,

        , came to my electorate and toured a number of small businesses in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Ringwood" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        with me. It was great to speak to them about our small business package. For once we have a government whose rhetoric is matched by its actions. Our small business package, and in particular tax cuts for small business and accelerated depreciation, is going to give small businesses the shot in the arm they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had the opportunity to visit Bill and Mary at Cafe Emjay in East Ringwood, who already make a wonderful coffee but are expanding their business. They are investing in new plant and equipment and an upgrade of their kitchen is certainly coming soon. The accelerated depreciation rates that will apply to all of that plant and equipment will certainly help them invest what they need to to grow their business. It is not just about growing business for the sake of it—it creates new jobs and new opportunities for our local economy and young people who want to get into the workforce. We also had a chance to visit Daisy's Garden Supplies—Evan Mulcahy and his team there do an absolutely outstanding job, and our package will enable them to invest more into their business. I thank the small business minister for visiting, and I want to thank Bill and Mary at Cafe Emjay and Evan at Daisy's Garden Supplies. Small business is the heart of our local economy and we will support it.
