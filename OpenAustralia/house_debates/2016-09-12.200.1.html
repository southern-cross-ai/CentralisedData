        Today I want to tell parliament about the recipients of the Spirit of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonee_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Moonee Valley
        </a>
        award for their work in the communityâ€”particularly Farah Warsame, Adrian Salvatore and Ruth Cook for their work in my electorate of Melbourne.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farah, who I have had the pleasure of working with closely for a number of years, is a leader in the Somali community of Victoria, which, through community and afterschool programs, has become a voice for the community in Melbourne. Farah is also the president of the Flemington Eagles Soccer Club, helping African youth engage through sport and helping the wider community come together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Adrian, as well as being a medallist at the Victorian Special Olympics, has worked as an ambassador for the Ascot Vale Special School, which educates local children with intellectual disabilities. Adrian has also used his sporting experience in the community, acting as a volunteer assistant coach for Kelly Sports, providing sport as an extracurricular activity for young Victorians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ruth is a Flemington local and a leader at the Canterbury Street Stables Playgroup, which, through their many recreational activities and programs, is helping to make a safe and supportive community for parents in the area. Before parliament resumed I took a Wednesday or Thursday morning off and took my one-year-old daughter down to the playgroup with Ruth, and I can tell you that the work she does as a volunteer pulling that together makes a massive difference for the parents and kids in our local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to mention the names of others listed for the award: Citizen of the Year Jonathan Tarascio;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Cahill" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Cahill
        </a>
        for contributing to the Essendon Historical Society; Helen van den Berg; Elizabeth Vescio; and Russell Mogg for his contributions.
