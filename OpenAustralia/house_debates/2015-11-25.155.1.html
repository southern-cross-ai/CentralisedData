        Last month I held a mental health roundtable, to hear directly from stakeholders about some of the issues and concerns that they have in their sector and how they relate to the Territory. I would like to place on record my thanks and gratitude to Steve Voulanas, who is the coordinator from

        , from Banyan House, which is a residential therapeutic community in my electorate; Emma Reid, from Top End Health Service; and

        , from the

        </a>
        , which operates the Sunrise Centre Drug and Alcohol Service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to place on record my thanks to Richard Campion from the Top End Health Service; Wendy Ah Chin, who is the executive director for Aboriginal Health; and Mike Melino, Margaret Farrell and Merrilee Cox, all from the

        . It is important that their participation, the wonderful insights that they had and the contributions that they were able to provide through their firsthand experience of working in this sector are acknowledged.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank the Territory Health Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elferink" rel="nofollow">
         John Elferink
        </a>
        , for his cooperation, and particularly for enabling his department staff to participate in this forum. It was really good to get a

        government's perspective on the issues at hand as well. Everyone at the table brought a unique perspective to the discussion, and I would like to, as I said, thank them for sharing their experiences.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate we face some challenges with mental health. There are relatively high rates of substance abuse and homelessness. We have a relatively small population, but an increasingly diverse one. We are also geographically isolated from other service providers. Some of the issues discussed included clinical planning and mapping in the field; education among the public and also health professionals—including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s—to enable a suite of assistance to those requiring mental health care; the funding gap in care programs; the crossover between corrections and mental health care; the gap in the levels of care available in Darwin and Palmerston; and the effect of alcohol abuse and ice, particularly involving young people in that community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, the forum was extremely insightful, and I will take all the opinions on board and consider them in the event of any possible reform in this area. I have already spoken with the minister, Susan Ley, about the feedback that we received and she was very receptive to this. I want to reassure people that I will do my very best to make sure that the experiences on this forum will inform the national debate.
