        My question is to the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister is aware, Tropical Cyclone Debbie is crossing the coast in my electorate as we speak. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's preparations for and planned response to Tropical Cyclone Debbie's impact upon my constituency of Dawson and across

         I thank the honourable member for his question. The thoughts and prayers of all honourable members are with his constituents and all of the people of

         facing Tropical Cyclone Debbie. As the honourable member noted, the cyclone has made landfall now, we are told, between Bowen and Proserpine. It is a category 4 cyclone with winds of up to 270 kilometres an hour near the centre. Conditions have deteriorated rapidly, as the honourable member is aware. The

        </p>
        <p>
         The federal and Queensland governments have prepared well for the onset of this cyclone. We have activated the disaster response plan to provide Queensland with every assistance that they need. The

        </p>
        <p>
         This morning I spoke again, as I have over the last 24 hours, with Premier Palaszczuk. At her request, with the Minister for Defence, I have arranged for Brigadier Chris Field, currently the commander of 3rd Brigade in Townsville, to act as the recovery coordinator for Tropical Cyclone Debbie. He is a distinguished military officer and he is the right man to head this recovery effort. I note that following the floods of 2011 he was the chief of operation and planned the Queensland Reconstruction Authority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our emergency services are the best in the world, and they are ready to respond as soon as Tropical Cyclone Debbie passes. There are around 1,000 people deployed or on stand-by to assist, and we thank them for their courage, their commitment and their selfless service. We are also working with the insurance and banking sectors to ensure that all factors are taken into consideration and all consideration is given when claims are made by households and businesses as a result of this cyclone.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would reiterate what I said yesterday to those in the path of the cyclone: take care and stay safe. It is too dangerous to stay outside. Be prepared to shelter in place until Wednesday. Emergency services will only be able to respond after the cyclone has passed and the winds have subsided. If you are sheltering at home, make sure you are prepared and listen to the radio for cyclone updates. When it is safe to do so check on your neighbours, friends and family, and look out for each other. Stay off the roads and do not drive through floodwater. Remember to stay calm and stay safe.

          I would like to briefly associate the opposition with the government's remarks. Right now the Prime Minister's words and the parliament's sentiments might not be able to be heard by the people in the brunt of this storm. There will be people at home without power, perhaps, people in shelters trying to ensure that their families are safe. Perhaps the only thing they can hear right now is cyclonic winds and the noise of lethal flying debris. It must be very harrowing for the people going through this. We are very fortunate to have the nurses and doctors serving in the wards, the emergency services, the volunteers, the ADF and the local government workforce. I want to say, in association with the Prime Minister's remarks, that I think all Australians are thinking, hoping and praying for the best possible outcomes for the people caught up in this terrible storm.
