       <p>
        Last Sunday at the Netball
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        state league grand finals, three teams from the mighty Tuggeranong Netball Association, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNA" rel="nofollow">
         TNA
        </a>
        , played in their finals: the under-17s, the under-19s and the open women's division 1.
       </p>
       <p>
        The under-17s were victorious in their match between TNA and Canberra Netball Association, the final margin being 37 to 32. This team fought against the odds, coming from fifth on the ladder at the start of July to champions on 30 July. Defender Jaida Crowle was named the most valuable player for the game.
       </p>
       <p>
        The under-19s were runners up, a great achievement, as they also had to fight hard to make it to the grand final match.
       </p>
       <p>
        The open women's division 1 team had a cracker of a match against Arawang Netball Association, also from Bean. TNA went into the last quarter with the teams trading goal for goal until TNA were able to get an intercept and went up, coming out as winners by 47 to 42 at the end of the game. The last time they were division 1 winners was in 2017, so it's a very sweet victory for the team. Shooter Sophia Martinussen, who is just 16 years of age, was named most valuable player for the game and is a Diamond in the making.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done to players, coaches, managers, umpires and all in the TNA community on a great season.
       </p>
