        Last week, we said goodbye in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        to Mr Jack Long, who died at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Darwin Hospital
        </a>
        on 9 July, aged 84. Jack was born under a tree near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti_Tree" rel="nofollow">
         Ti Tree
        </a>
        in Anmatjere country in 1937 and was part of the stolen generation. At the age of three, Mr Long was taken from his parents by welfare officers and transported to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        and then to Darwin. He was forcibly removed from his family and, after travelling on a truck, a train and a lugger boat, where he saw the ocean for the first time, he was placed in a Catholic mission on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melville_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Melville Island
        </a>
        in 1941.
       </p>
       <p>
        While he was born in Anmatjere country, he became a saltwater man who spoke Tiwi and passed on the language and all his hunting and cultural skills to his children. Refining hunting and gathering skills came naturally to Jack through his early years and was to last throughout his life. Suitably and appropriately, his final job was as a ranger. He had previously worked his whole life driving trucks, on pearl luggers, shooting crocodiles from canoes and in other roles, but his favourite job was his final role as a sea ranger on the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        But his proudest achievement, without doubt, was his family. Mr Long married his wife, Agnes, in 1959, and they had nine children. The sons were Steven, Brian, Michael, Noel, Christopher, Patrick and John, and the two daughters were Kathy and Susie. Mr Long's children and their families and extended families were his life. He was a renowned sportsman and a member of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's
        </a>
        Football Club. He played in nine grand finals. He played over 200 games and won grand finals in 1965, 1966 and 1972. Mr Long was able to proudly see his son Michael lead the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Walk" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to Canberra to confront

        people in this country. He was immensely proud of his family. All seven of his sons followed in their father's footsteps and played for St Mary's, and of course Michael went on to play 190 games for the

        and Essendon.

        Mr Long was a wonderful man. He had a huge personality, was a great patriarch and was the epitome of what it was to be a Territorian and what it is to be one in this century. He was a wonderful person and a very good friend.
