        I rise to acknowledge the contributions of two valued members of the Cowan community. Mr Ted Nguyen is the president of Westnam United Soccer Club. It's my pleasure to award Ted the Australian Government Certificate of Appreciation for Australian Volunteers 2021. As a young man, Ted played social football, or soccer, for the Vietnamese united team in the 1980s. He had a vision to expand the Vietnamese united soccer team, and with his leadership and drive they eventually incorporated and became the Westnam United Soccer Club. The Westnam United Soccer Club now has over 300 members and annually hosts the WA Asian cup at Westnam's home ground in Koondoola in Cowan. The team has also diversified its cultural base, and now includes a multitude of nationalities, including one-third refugees and migrants to Australia. As president of the Westnam United Soccer Club, Ted has also assisted other not-for-profit organisations by sponsoring them as the auspicing body to help them secure community grants. Ted has been a member of the WA chapter of the

         Vietnamese Community in Australia
        </a>
        for the last 10 years. During that time, he has volunteered in a myriad of ways, including for the annual Tet festival, attending local government multicultural meetings and supporting Vietnamese senior citizens. Congratulations, Ted.
