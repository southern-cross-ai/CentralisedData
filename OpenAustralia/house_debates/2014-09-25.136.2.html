       <p>
        It gives me no pleasure really to speak in this debate because it is a debate we would want otherwise not to have. Nevertheless, it is the case that we now have committed Australian forces yet again into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . We as a parliament need to indicate our strong support for them and the reasons for which they are embarking. I am pleased to support the contribution made by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech on 22 September. He made a number of very important points, including that our support for this is not about jingoism or nationalism; it is a calculation of conscience and national interests. He outlined four key points which underpin our approach, which are that we do not support the deployment of ground combat units to directly engage in fighting ISIL, that Australian operations should be confined to the territory of Iraq, that our involvement should continue only until the Iraqi government are in a position to take full responsibility for the security of their people and their nation and that, if the Iraqi government and their forces engage in unacceptable conduct or adopt unacceptable policies, we should withdraw our support immediately. Nevertheless, we do know that we are confronting an insidious form of terror in the Middle East right at this time. We need to comprehend its impact on us not only tangentially, in a sense, but also directly as a result of the impacts it is having on the Middle East itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the good fortune to meet with some representatives of the Turkish parliament, including its Speaker, earlier in the week. It is clear now that tens of thousands—I think in excess of 120,000—refugees came across the Turkish border in a matter of 24 or 48 hours. That puts in stark light the impact that this terrorist activity is having on the region. We should not understate what it means in terms of a humanitarian disaster and its regional implications. We are a long way from the place, but we do understand that this is in part a legacy, I think, of our failed behaviour in 2003. Nevertheless, we are now in a position, despite what has happened previously, where we are committed to addressing the issues in Iraq and, indeed, having an impact on the region to try and prevent and stop the insidious work of this murderous and barbaric organisation, ISIL. We know that its impact is broad across the community, almost non-discriminatory in its negative impact, and particularly on women and girls, who are being oppressed, raped, tortured and forced into sexual servitude. We need to understand what this means. I think that having Australian troops, in this case
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        units, deployed is really a very important sign to the world that we take this matter very, very seriously.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that the Australian personnel will be based out of Al Minhad, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE" rel="nofollow">
         UAE
        </a>
        . It is a very comfortable base. They will be looked after properly, but their role is really very important, and they will be embarking on some very dangerous activity. We want to ensure that they have our support—I know that they do across this parliament—and that their families have our support and love for them as they think about their partners, uncles, fathers, cousins, mates, whatever their relationship might be, who are over there at the moment and will be into the future, who knows for how long. This is an issue which ought to be front and centre of the minds of all of us, as I have spoken about on many occasions in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we also need to understand the impact here at home. I do not think that ill-informed and inflammatory comments about Islam are helpful. I am very concerned indeed and regret the fact that there are some in our community, including—as the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for citizenship and multiculturalism said in a letter which they have sent out to the community only in the last day or so—a very few elected representatives in this parliament, who have made comments which have the potential to damage community harmony and inflame tensions. We strongly oppose those ill-informed and dangerous views, and we will continue to speak out against them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are in this together. We need to make sure that there is a consensus across the Australian community. Now is not the time for division. That means that we should not be picking on one section of the Australian community just because of their religion. We need to understand that we live in what is probably the best example of a multicultural community in the world, and to have any person or persons seek to break down our belief in multiculturalism—our support for multiculturalism—in the way that is being done by some in this place is very dangerous.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen the acts of idiots—and sadly one of those was killed this week—but we need to understand that this is a minority group who do not represent the broader population. They represent something which is foreign to us—alien to us—and something that we across this country will never support. At the same time, we realise there is a direct relationship between what they may be doing or attempting to do here and what is happening in the Middle East, and that is why our engagement there is so vitally important.
       </p>
       <p>
        This particular insidious movement transgresses—goes across—geographical boundaries. It is not nation upon nation. It is a group of terrorist thugs trying to intimidate people in the community by murderous and barbaric acts. We need to reject those murderous and barbaric acts, and we should be uniting behind those in the community who are suffering as a direct result. Some are suffering through an indirect affiliation, because of their religion. They should not suffer. We should be making every effort to ensure that we work across this community to support those wonderful people. As the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister have said in their letter:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Islamic story in Australia has a rich history and grows stronger each year. Australia’s Muslim community continues to do our nation a great service by fostering enduring cultural and religious harmony, and making a substantial contribution to our national prosperity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well may that continue into the future, as I am sure it will. This reflects a modern Australian multiculturalism; a story of cultural enrichment, social cohesion and economic growth, and it is a story that the Labor Party is committed to and will always defend.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important time for all of us and we need to understand its implications on us not only directly but also indirectly. We need to comprehend that the way in which these matters are being played out in other places is a source of great concern and should be a source of great concern to all civilised peoples. That is why our engagement is so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister—although I did not agree with everything the Prime Minister had to say nevertheless I agree with the sentiments. We in this place need to unite behind the fact that we have sent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel into potentially mortal danger. We need to comprehend and to understand what it means for them and their families, and subsequently what it means for us. We are playing an important role on the international stage albeit as a small-power nation, really, but at the same time we are showing our commitment to those values about which I spoke earlier.

        <p>
         I also stand to support the Prime Minister's statement in regard to national security. He said that to keep people safe, we need to ensure our security measures at home and abroad are directed against terrorism and not religion. He said that we need to ensure Australians live normally, because a terrorist's goal is to scare us out of being ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         My thoughts are very much with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Police
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , in particular the two members, who were stabbed in this awful incident in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_Hills" rel="nofollow">
          Endeavour Hills
         </a>
         , and their families. Endeavour Hills is just a short distance from my electorate of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         , so it definitely impacts on my electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have a background in the Victoria Police. I left the Victoria Police back in 2004 as a senior sergeant in the counterterrorism unit, so I know the good fight these members and the entire law enforcement community are involved in—to serve to protect. The Victoria Police motto has always been 'Uphold the right'. They serve to protect the public, and that is what they were doing. It was a joint task force. They were protecting the public. That should never be forgotten. That is their role. They put their lives on the line every day—men and women across Australia—to protect the public. Overseas, our military personnel are endeavouring to make the world a safer place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also, I do have condolences for the youth who was involved in this awful situation and it took his life. And I congratulate moderate Muslims who have come out and stated that it is barbaric to support the fatwa which was directed against Australians, against the Prime Minister and against law enforcement officers in this country. Sadly, it appears that one young Australian listened to what was being said overseas. That is a tragedy on so many levels. Again, I feel so sorry for his family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some people in my electorate believe that this is just hype by the government and also by the police—and that is even after the events which have sadly taken place. Look at what is happening around the world. We have at least 60 Australians who have decided to travel overseas to fight in a war for the so-called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
          Islamic State
         </a>
         terrorists across Iraq and Syria, and back home they are supported by another hundred. So 60 Australians have gone overseas. We already know a number have been killed, including in suicide bombings. So if they are prepared to go overseas and lose their life in the battle, that is what the law enforcement agencies are up against. If they are prepared to do that overseas, well, obviously, they can be prepared to lose their own lives here in Australia. There have been at least 20 Australian citizens who have returned to Australia from fighting with Islamic State terrorists. I call them 'terrorists'. That is what they are. They do the most barbaric acts to other human beings, including beheadings, as we have heard from other members in this chamber, and rapes. They are there to cause fear and that is what they are trying to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sixty Australians have had their passports cancelled trying to go and fight with this group in Iraq and Syria. Cancelling their passports is the right action to take. They call themselves 'foreign fighters', but their actions are no more than getting involved in an organisation, if I can call the Islamic State terrorists that, to kill others and use every measure they can to take control of Syria and Iraq. And this fight will only spread.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have had, in the past, potential attacks in Australia. Again, the joint task force and the law enforcement agencies right across Australia have done a fantastic job and they keep on doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to acknowledge the opposition, in particular the opposition leader. I heard some great speeches before. There is bipartisan support for this. Everyone is working to make Australia a safer place. There are counterterrorism laws soon to be introduced. I will not go into detail because they are before the House. I have been a very strong advocate of changes for preventative detention, and that is something I will continue to support to give the police the tools that they need to fight terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is another issue which I have raised in this House a number of times before, even at the time of my maiden speech in parliament in 2004. What concerns me is we do not have a national database to collect vital information. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimTrac" rel="nofollow">
          CrimTrac
         </a>
         database, a Commonwealth national database, used to store selective information including fingerprints,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
          DNA
         </a>
         , profiles, details of sex offenders and criminal histories. CrimTrac has been hampered by the failure of relevant authorities to allow the consolidation of data relating to explosives, chemical purchases and ammonium nitrate fertilisers, which are otherwise known as high-consequence dangerous goods.
        </p>
        <p>
         The situation people need to be aware of is that the police, for example, would have already done a check on a person who is wishing to buy explosives, so we are not talking about breaching civil liberties. That information is stored within state departments and territories around this country, including those who are undertaking pilot training. As we saw in September 11, pilot training was used in terrorist attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
         This information needs to be dragged out of the departments and made available to police, so that when they are looking at a person, a terror suspect, and do their broader searches on friends, relatives and associates—or they may have met with the person—they may find, especially if the person moves from state to state, that the person has been buying something in one state which they would not be aware of unless they have a national database such as CrimTrac. This could be the red flag to alert law enforcement agencies: 'Hang on, what's going on here? Someone's trying to buy something or get their hands on something potentially to harm Australians.'
        </p>
        <p>
         I remember that in Jordan terrorists planned a plot where they endeavoured to get their hands on chemicals and used stolen vehicles, and also vehicles they got under false names, and their attack was intended to kill 100,000 people. So the terrorists have tried things before, and what we need to do is give credence to what has happened around the world. Again, my background at the counter-terrorism unit in Victoria was looking at research, looking at what was happening overseas, and also looking at the legislation. I have had strong concerns about the need for a national database for some time, and also the need to look at relevant state legislation of mandatory reporting of the loss and theft of high-consequence dangerous goods. At this stage I believe the only one listed on there is ammonium nitrate fertiliser. I believe that list this needs to be increased. Again, the police need this information, especially when things are hotting up. They need to make sure they have everything in their power.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do acknowledge and congratulate the Minister for Justice,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keenan" rel="nofollow">
          Michael Keenan
         </a>
         . I have written to him raising my concerns about this—and, as I have said, I have raised this numerous times before. He is taking this very seriously, and the Prime Minister is too. They are awaiting advice to see how we can actually ensure we get an outcome to give law enforcement agencies all the tools they need to make Australia a safer place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, in closing, we heard other members say, and I totally agree, that it is a time to be calm in Australia. It is a time to have respect for other people's religions and beliefs. That is the best way to prove to others out there who want to harm Australians, who the extremists call infidels, that in actual fact we are a great country. We are a very respectful country. One in four Australians have been overseas. In the future, as in the past, we need to work together and put Australia and our beliefs first.

         </small>
         <p>
          Of the raids that were held last week, a number of those homes were actually in my electorate, so I felt the need to make a contribution to the security statement today. We know that what terrorists want is for us to fear each other, to attack each other and to lessen our freedoms, because all of these things increase their recruiting power within our community. These are the things that we must resist: the temptation to let fear get out of control, to blame the innocent for the actions of a very small number and to lessen our freedoms beyond the things that we need to do to keep ourselves safe. I know my community very well. I have been representing it now for very close to 10 years, and I do not feel afraid of it. I do not feel afraid to be in it or to go to the many events that I do, and the events of the last two weeks do not change that in any way. In fact, I see my community and all its diversity as one of the great hopes of this nation. We speak every language. We understand every culture in the world. We know every religion. There is not a city in the world that we cannot navigate without a map. It is in every way, as the world gets smaller, our strength. Our diversity is our strength when we deal with the threat of terrorism within our community.
         </p>
         <p>
          If there are people in our community who wish us harm, for every one of them there are literally thousands of us: people of all religions and cultural backgrounds, people doing the best they can, people who greatly appreciate living in this wonderful free country, people who obviously and naturally reject terrorism. And the thousands of us have every opportunity to pull together, stronger than ever.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is not the first time that things have gone wrong in our community around Parramatta. The shootings by the bikie gangs that you read about in the newspapers were pretty much my community as well. There have been times in recent years when a very small number of people have caused havoc on our streets, in and around Parramatta, and now it appears that increased efforts by ISIL to recruit may have borne fruit. But that possibility provides us with an opportunity to focus on us as a community, not to fight the few—law enforcement will do that more than the broader community—but to support the many, to come together to make sure that we are stronger as a community because of these events, not weaker. Our community will be defined in future by how we manage our fears and hopes in the coming days, weeks and months and the extent to which we reach out to each other in support.
         </p>
         <p>
          In many ways the people who most need our support at the moment are the Muslim community. Last year at about this time a group came to me to tell me that members of the Islamic community, even then, were afraid to go out in the street. The women in particular, because they quite often wear the scarf—and there are many Muslims in my community who do not but many who do—were being spat on, abused or jostled, having their clothing pulled, sometimes having their scarves ripped from their heads and knocked to the street, even if they were out with their small children or pushing a pram. There were a growing number of women who were actually afraid to go out because of the level of religious bigotry that they were experiencing. I am told now that it is worse than ever. That is not acceptable. Every member of our community needs to stand up against this. Every member of our community needs to stand up against the treatment of people within our community in this way.
         </p>
         <p>
          If there are people in our communities who wish to do us harm, the problem is perhaps better understood by a community as diverse as mine. If there are cracks in our community that let in views and beliefs that lead to violence and intimidation, they will be more easily identified by our Islamic community than by even the law enforcement agencies. Our answers and solutions as a community will be stronger if we trust in each other and accept the contributions that each of us makes to building our lives.
         </p>

          One of the strengths of diversity at times like this is the range of experiences and views that we hold. There are people in my community who know Iraq and Syria because they lived there. There are those who were persecuted there and fled for that reason. For some, their family still live in Syria or Iraq, and others with dual citizenship may have homes there as well as in Australia. There are many others who know the history of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East
          </a>
          . They know the history of intervention by the West, the various conflicts that have taken place over recent decades and the perceptions that are held by those communities because of the history that they have lived. There are others who have been persecuted in their first country and who hold deeply held views about the characteristics of another ethnic or religious group. There are people of all religions with varying levels of understanding about all the other religions that surround us, and there are others who have great understanding because they have taken the time, through interfaith dialogue, to learn it.
         </p>
         <p>
          So, when something like the events of the last couple of weeks takes place, the views in my community are broad and diverse and all valuable. All are valuable. One of the negatives at a time like this—and I found it when I was phoning various religious leaders last week—was the number of them who said that they did not feel that now was the time to speak. They felt that, if they spoke about their beliefs on the sending of troops to Iraq, the government's response, the opposition's response or the policy response in Australia and they were critical of it, they might be tagged with the 'friend of terrorists' tag. They felt uneasy about speaking out. That is a great shame because we have never in this country been afraid of differences of opinion, and we have never been afraid of criticism of government. As long as that criticism comes from where I know it does come—which is a wish for us to do the best we can for our community—we should be welcoming of the full range of views.
         </p>
         <p>
          In fact, I believe that our policy responses in the long term will be stronger if we can listen to and take account of the range of views with trust rather than suspicion. Again, I know my community well enough to know that in their hearts they wish the best for this country—which is theirs and in which they live—and the views that they express are given in good faith because they believe that they can make a contribution to the policy debate. I look forward to a time when people in my community, those of Muslim faith in particular, can speak openly about their concerns about the way the government and opposition might be pursuing policy solutions, without fear that it will somehow reflect on their loyalty to this country. I do not question their loyalty. I look forward to a time when that is the case. I would also urge them, as the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 was introduced yesterday, that if they have strong views they are always welcome in my office to discuss them—always. It is time for us all to use the strength and the diversity we have to find the best answers that we possibly can.

          About two years ago, I think, I went to a function at one of my local arts centres with an Arabic hip-hop artist from Iraq. He is called
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Narcissist" rel="nofollow">
           The Narcissist
          </a>
          ; that is his name. He is supposedly one of the most influential Arabic speakers in the world but he does hip-hop and it is really quite clever. He had introduced me to a hip-hop work at that time which was actually called
          <i>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terrorist" rel="nofollow">
            The Terrorist
           </a>
          </i>
          . It was by a Palestinian artist, so it said the kinds of things that you would expect within that frame—a very, very good piece of hip-hop, whether you agree with its sentiments or not.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was such a good piece of work and I wanted to share it with some friends of mine, so I said to a young Muslim friend of mine, 'There's this really great piece of hip-hop called
          <i>
           The Terrorist
          </i>
          ; just google it.' He said: 'I can't google "the terrorist"; I'm a young Islamic man. I'll have people following me around the street.' So, even two years ago, this young man—who is as far from being a terrorist as I am from being a white extremist, quite frankly; no-one who knew this man could ever assume anything of him but good—was afraid that, if he actually googled certain words, he would fall under the umbrella of 'a person of suspicion'. That is a terrible condition to live under.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would ask us all as a community to just consider the pressures we put on some of our communities when we start to lose our trust in their loyalty to this nation. I congratulate those—as Minister Morrison did yesterday in the parliament—who held barbecues and public gatherings in the last few weeks to bring people together and speak openly about a commitment to Australia. There were some very good gatherings, particularly in Lakemba recently, where the Muslim community came together to do just that. I thank them for doing that, in the same way that I look forward to a time when people of Islamic faith can speak their views openly without fear of assumptions or suspicion.
         </p>
         <p>
          I look forward to a time when the Islamic community does not feel it necessary to come together to demonstrate their Australianness. They do not have to do that for me. We have had Muslims living in this country for decades. We had our first mosque in 1883. We had two in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
           Broken Hill
          </a>
          by 1886. I have fifth-generation Muslims in Parramatta and Turks who have been living there for 40 years. They are a fine part of our community and I wish them all the support they need at this time.

           Each and every one of us has a slightly different list of policies that we believe will lead to good government. There is, however, one absolute that is common to most of us in the chamber, and it is that a good government allows its citizens to live in a safe and secure environment. The government will do whatever is possible to keep our people safe. Our security measures are directed only at crime and terrorism and nothing else. Above all, at this time of tighter security and international uncertainty, Australians can and must live normally. There is a development where some radical individuals, both at home and abroad, see an opportunity to disrupt Australian life by creating doubts and fears. We are a happy-go-lucky country with a great record of acceptance and compassion for others. We will continue to go to work, go to school, travel and carry on with our daily lives, as we believe in the greater good of the Australian multicultural family.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has known for some months that some self-styled death cult members have been organising events to take away our sense of national safety and security. This government will always do whatever is possible to keep people safe, with targeted, specialised security measures directed against terrorism of all forms.
          </p>
          <p>
           The execution of 30 search warrants across Sydney and Brisbane last week shows that our security forces are hard at work to keep us safe in our communities. The increased level of security alert enabled the authorities to discover and interrupt a sickening terrorist plot—an attack specifically designed to show a public tragedy in the same manner as we witnessed in videos relayed from Iraq and Syria. Last week an Australian ISIL operative instructed his followers in Sydney and Brisbane to abduct random people from the street and demonstrate that there were ISIL supporters right here at home. Such an attack has the effect of destabilising our sense of personal safety. The worst part is that all that was needed for such an attack was a knife, a camera phone and an innocent Australian. I commend the government on deploying over 800 police and security agents to investigate and disrupt this disgraceful and disgusting plot within 36 hours of the operative's commands.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australians should also be reassured when the increased security results in charges being laid for serious terrorism offences over raids. A large amount of evidence is being put together. They are currently analysing this material. In his statement, the Prime Minister explained that our security agencies considered the latest statements as being genuine. The communications of this group have been monitored for some months, but this instruction to do Australians harm was the trigger for urgent action. What the Australian government is doing is clear. We are responding intelligently to a very real threat. I urge any member of the public, especially in my electorate of Gilmore, to report anything they see as suspicious to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
            National Security

           Hotline on 1800 123 400, or directly to our local police.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Prime Minister, in his statement on Monday, declared that the actions we have taken against these would-be terrorists show that we are determined not to be intimidated by those who would plan to harm us. The Prime Minister is right. Australians will not succumb to this terrorist fearmongering and attacks. We will not stand for the injustices that we see ISIL committing on the other side of the world. Every day we are seeing more and more reports of beheadings, crucifixions, mass executions, ethnic cleansing, rape, sexual slavery and torture from these barbaric imposters who try and call themselves a legitimate Islamic state. They are simply an emotionally charged death cult. I have travelled widely, and I tell you that 99 per cent of Muslims are just as loving and compassionate as 99 per cent of Christians. To call the ISIL death cult an Islamic state is an offence to all good, moderate Muslims across the world. Indeed, Australia's own Muslim grand mufti recently said that nearly all Australian Muslims believe that ISIL is committing crimes against humanity and sins against God.

He then went on to explain that the overwhelming majority of Australian Muslims have outright completely rejected this minority opinion of Australian Muslims who feel as if they have an obligation to join a terrorist organisation such as ISIL. He then went on to explain that, like most of us, the majority of the people he works with simply want, and I quote, 'to help my community, to be educated, to have a good job and to be a trustworthy and honest person in my life'.

           are working hard to keep us safe from those who would seek to harm us, both at home and abroad. The government is ensuring that our security agencies have all the resources and the authority that they reasonably need. We have committed an extra $630 million in funding. Additional personnel are being recruited. Biometric screening will be introduced at our international airports within 12 months, and there will be more people on the ground at airports.
          </p>
          <p>
           Legislation on agency powers is currently before the parliament. The government is soon to introduce additional legislation: firstly, to increase the powers of intelligence agencies; secondly, to stop Australians from fighting overseas and then encouraging and committing terrorist acts at home. This is not legislation designed to infringe on civil liberties or to introduce arbitrary new powers for police and security agencies. It is simply about strengthening existing terrorism legislation. It is about making sure that those people who are suspected by police and security agencies cannot use legal technicalities to stop an investigation or a search. Introducing legislation that is more comprehensive and will stop individuals escaping due process because of a technicality is essential to save Australian lives and for maintaining the social fabric of an open, free and multicultural Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that there are at least 60 Australians currently fighting with groups like ISIL in Syria and Iraq and at least another 100 Australians supporting them. More than 20 of these fighters have so far attempted to return home to Australia. These are Australian citizens, and they are involved in the ISIL death cult. It really is beyond reasonable understanding that these young people, who have grown up here in Australia, can accept these actions of beheadings and all those other dreadful things as being okay. I am sure their mothers and fathers must be weeping. It is only right that this government take strong and decisive action to stop these people from freely re-entering Australia, to stop those funding and supporting this movement from home and to stop those who are propagating these beliefs to young Australians and vulnerable Australian Muslims across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are already some in the community who argue that this is not our problem; it is a problem over there, across the ocean. But they could not be more wrong. As I have already said,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIN_News" rel="nofollow">
            WIN News
           </a>
           Illawarra has already aired a story about ISIL in the Illawarra actively approaching young Muslims in my region. This just goes to show that ISIL is very much our problem, as much as it is a problem for our whole planet. Not every parent knows all the time what their child is watching, what they are subjected to or whom they are joining in with. Some of our vulnerable youth are at extreme risk.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia's humanitarian aid, supported with advisers, is an essential part of assisting the Iraqi government. Australia knows that rapidly creeping and dangerous action in Iraq by ISIL is not a problem that will remain over there, across the ocean. If we are in a position to assist with preventing genocide, we have a conscience and a moral duty to do just that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those who seek to harm us do not value our freedoms. They do not understand and they do not respect our love of other cultures and our efforts to create a society of equality. Australians stand strong and united in their desire to retain our wonderful, safe, secure Australia. We will continue to be a tolerant and united Australia. We will continue to welcome to our nation those who wish to adopt our values, to contribute and to identify with being a fair dinkum Aussie. I strongly support the Prime Minister in his efforts to maintain a safe and secure Australia. I strongly support the government's actions that will ensure that our security agencies and the laws that govern them are kept current, relevant and powerful enough to deter these cowardly terrorists.

            I welcome the opportunity to provide some brief comments in respect of the statement on national security. I begin by acknowledging the Prime Minister's statement to the parliament on Monday. As the Prime Minister said, on matters of national security the government and opposition stand together—and there can be no response at this time other than bipartisanship. As the Leader of the Opposition said, our support for the government on this issue is not a case of nationalism but rather 'a calculation of conscience and national interest'. I want to acknowledge the hard work by the government, especially in hand with those departments and those agencies including
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
             ASIO
            </a>
            and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
             AFP
            </a>
            , in ensuring that all Australians remain safe and that our streets remain peaceful.
           </p>
           <p>
            The night before last in Melbourne, we saw a young man shot by police after physically assaulting two officers, reportedly following some matters including antisocial behaviour in a public area. I acknowledge the strong efforts by the police to protect our citizens and keep our community safe. Like the entire parliament, I send my best wishes to the officers who were injured and their families. I wish them a speedy recovery and thank them for their service. I also send my thoughts and prayers to the family of the young man who has been tragically killed. They will be dealing with the death of their son, a young man who has apparently been lost to extremism. They will no doubt be asking many questions, and the investigations that will ensue will no doubt be looking for answers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also like to acknowledge the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition on Monday and endorse those comments. As the Leader of the Opposition said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … we should never make the millions of Australians or people who have become Australians—people of every nation and every faith—feel less safe, or less welcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cannot let extremists destroy our way of life or our diverse society. The rich success of multiculturalism has transformed Australia into a vibrant and prosperous nation. Our multicultural society has made an enormous contribution to the Australia of today, and it is indeed hard to imagine the shape of our nation today without their valuable contributions.
           </p>
           <p>
            For several month we have been seeing barbaric images of ISIL conducting vicious attacks on young, innocent people, people like American journalist

             James Foley
            </a>
            . But what has not been widely reported until now is the brutal sexual violence and treatment of women in places such as Iraq and Syria. It is these issues that I would like to turn to.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             The United Nations
            </a>
            estimates that around 1500 women, teenage girls and boys, have been captured by ISIL with some being sold into slavery and for as little as $25.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN" rel="nofollow">

           </p>

            who has detailed some of this horrific treatment of women by ISIL. Whilst it is so disturbing, I am pleased to see that we are getting some public recognition of this matter. As Ms Baird said:

            on 20 September and, whilst it is difficult to read, as I said, I am pleased to see that the fourth estate is turning seriously to this matter and is, as she puts in her title, 'ISIL death cult obscures its rape cult,' bringing this to light. I would like to quote some of this. She writes:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Over the past few months,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
             Islamic State
            </a>
            has been conducting an extensive, barbaric campaign of rape against women in Iraq and Syria.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            But, oddly, we're not talking about it very much.

           <p class="italic">
            If we're going to be using dramatic terms such as 'death cult', shouldn't it be deemed a 'rape cult' as well?
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The stories have a sickening similarity. After sustained aerial attack, when soldiers walk into newly emptied, dusty streets in Iraq, dotted with dead bodies and mangled car carcasses, they have found naked women, bound and left on the ground, who have been raped repeatedly.

            I raise this issue, because I think it is very important to understand what we are dealing with here. It reminds us why we need to be unified against such evils and it reminds us that, too often in war, it is women and children who fare so much worse. There can be no other greater testament to this than what is happening at the moment to these innocent women and girls by people who have no right to claim that they are doing this in the name of faith.

             I rise to speak on the Prime Minister's statement updating the House about the developments in Iraq and the movements of IS. It is natural that as a pluralist democratic nation we do not jump at the chance to become involved in international conflicts. However, with at least 60 Australians currently fighting with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, and at least 100 more Australians supporting them, the conflict is obviously reaching out to us. As the Prime Minister has said, nothing can justify the actions of this death cult. It is in Australia's best interests that we stand ready with the world to help the new Iraqi government disrupt and degrade the IS movement and regain control over its own country. As

             Australia's terrorism alert level has been lifted from medium to high in light of recent statements issued by ISIL calling for attacks against members of the international coalition, including Australians. The Australian government is regarding those threats as genuine and is taking the necessary action to ensure the safety of all Australians. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
              Islamic State
             </a>
             terrorists have their sights set on the West. It is Australia's duty to stand with the world and ensure these violent radicals are stopped. Australia must join with the international coalition and prevent these extremists from further threatening all that we hold dear: our freedom, our democracy and our way of life. In this case, international military intervention is necessary. Australians do not want this; no sane person would. We live in a remarkable, tolerant, multicultural society. Yes, we could do it better, but what we see around the world, the intolerance and the hatred, shows just how well we have done.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have not come to this point easily. There have been difficulties with that growth, because as we have built our society through different waves of migration we have confronted change: different people; different cultures. From 1770 to today Australia has borne this change. New people are different. From colonial days through early British migration, post World War
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
              II
             </a>
             and post Vietnam to today, different people have arrived. In the fifties and sixties people spoke of 'wogs' and 'Ities' and 'dagos'—less culturally sensitive in those days but with a touch of larrikin humour. With my maiden name of Righetti, I received my fair share of 'wog' and 'spaghetti' and other colourful tags, albeit none with any malice. Then there were concerns about the Vietnamese migrants and then about Japanese and Chinese investment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Out of all this has come a remarkable multicultural society, a cultural mix that is a key factor in what Australia is today. We are justly proud of our society and we are properly concerned when it comes under threat. Indeed, it could be said that our society is like the environment: different species and varieties make it stronger and more resilient. If we were all the same, we would be weaker and considerably more boring. However, there is an understandable view that at times we should put up the shutters and leave the rest of the world to its own folly and to the bastardry and evil that brews in other places, because over the years we have seen the cost of wars counted not only in the number of deaths of so many fine young Australians but also in the cost to wives and children. We have seen the challenges faced by returning soldiers both physically and mentally—challenges better handled today but still fraught with pain and suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have put troops on the ground in the Middle East many times in decades past. My father flew in the Middle East as a fighter pilot with 3 Squadron in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">

             . He was shot down and became a prisoner of war. My son has served there as well. In Afghanistan, great nations have fought wars through history, and yet it appears that little has changed except that Afghans live with conflict and death as a constant companion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Against this remarkable canvas of history, ranging from our multicultural success to this ever-present conflict in the Middle East, we stand today considering our reaction to events so far away. I do so as a member of our nation's parliament representing over 100,000 people, so my contribution to this debate cannot be as simple as a jingoistic call to arms.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I move through Ryan and I talk to my constituents I see, as I am sure my colleagues do too, the mix of reactions to what people see played out on their televisions: beheadings of the innocent, rape, kidnapping on a massive scale, murder, pure evil, children taken from their parents, young women given to ISIL fighters and education systematically dismantled. The reaction in our community has been one of revulsion and swift in condemnation, but mixed with the not unreasonable fear and a question as to whether this will be resolved by yet another war. There are those who would point to the past of that troubled region and suggest that it is European and Western forays into the Middle East, from the artificial boundaries of centuries past through to the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that when combined with the liberalism of the internet has created a maelstrom of conflict where intervention is fruitless.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Australia's initial reaction to what we have seen is right. Such barbarity as we have seen, such evil unsupported by my any moralism or religion, cannot be left unchecked. Australia's reaction is right if for no other reason than the stark fact that the world is a much smaller place than it used to be. The turmoil of the developing world is at our doorstep. In decades past the trauma of far-flung countries was largely unseen and unheard and, importantly, confined by geography. But not today, because all of the elements of these conflicts play out before us and, sadly, often play out in our own society or in those of our neighbours; not today, because if we allow this evil to prevail across Iraq and Syria and beyond, we will pay an even greater price in the future; not today, because true evil unchecked can reach into the very heart of our own society. Already we see young Australians drawn into this web of evil. This is not new—people have joined crazy and barbaric cults before, but largely their evil has been confined. But today, just as the internet has reached into the Middle East with messages of freedom and hope, the same internet provides an immediate reach into our own society. This morning's news highlights that fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are no easy options, just a stark choice between careful and considered action supporting the victims of this evil and doing nothing. This will be a long and tortuous road, but we must prevail. It is Australian society, more than most, that demonstrates the wonderful success of multicultural society. It is a beacon of hope that we must defend from the evil and barbarism of these fanatics. I support the government's actions and I acknowledge the support of the opposition. This is an action taken on behalf of all Australians. It is just and it is correct. It is fraught with danger, but it must be done.

              Earlier this month I made another statement on Iraq in which I referenced some of the atrocities that have been occurring in that country, particularly the atrocities against women. I spoke about the fact that women are being kidnapped and transported to Syria to be sold into marriage. Since I made that statement we have learned a lot more about the horrific and systematic acts of gender-based violence that are being carried out as part of this conflict and being used as a strategy of war.

              estimates 1,500 women, teenage girls and boys have been captured by IS and some sold into slavery for as little as a reported $25, but numbers vary. The director of the human rights office in Iraq says that as many as 2,500 women were captured in north-eastern Iraq alone, almost half of whom were converted by force and then married.

              reports that some women entrapped in Mosul's Badush prison gave birth to newborns who were immediately snatched from them, others were bizarrely dolled up by local beauticians before being introduced to brand new husbands, and teenagers were being forced to marry strangers. IS has launched a blatant recruitment drive via social media to lure young and vulnerable women to leave their homes to wed violent terrorists. Baird reports:

              I welcome the fact that, as well as the $5 million that the Australian government has donated for humanitarian assistance to Iraq, an additional $2 million is being donated specifically to support the hundreds of thousands of women and girls affected by violence in Iraq. The money will provide reproductive health care, including obstetric services for about 250,000 pregnant women in the region.

              I would also like to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that, when it comes to conflict, we have the responsibility not only to protect women by preventing gender-based violence but also to ensure that women are involved in peace building at the highest level at every step of the way. These responsibilities are outlined in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
               United Nations Security Council

              resolution 1325, which addresses the impact of war on women and women's contributions to preventing conflict and promoting sustainable peace.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was incredibly proud to be part of the government in 2012 when Australia adopted our own National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, establishing a framework for a coordinated whole-of-government approach to implementing
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCR" rel="nofollow">
               UNSCR
              </a>
              1325. The experiences of men and woman in war are different. In these differences, women offer a vital perspective in the analysis of conflict as well as providing strategies towards peace building that focus on creating ties across opposing factions and increasing the inclusiveness, transparency and sustainability of peace processes. The intrinsic role of women in peace and security is often unrecognised or is an afterthought. I have spoken to women in Afghanistan who said that they have had to fight to be at the table when it comes to establishing and rebuilding peace in their country. In their words, they have had to fight to ensure that women are around the table, not on the menu.

             <p class="italic">
              … there has been an impression of women as helpless victims of wars and conflicts. Women’s role in fostering peace in their communities and beyond has often been overlooked.
             </p>
             <p>
              Women have shown time and again that they bring a qualitative improvement in structuring peace and in the post-conflict architecture. Chowdhury, a leading force in UNSCR 1325, says:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The main question is not to make war safe for women, but to structure the peace in a way that there is no recurrence of war and conflict. That is why women need to be at the peace tables, involved in the decision-making and in peace-keeping teams. They need to be there particularly as civilians, to make a real difference in transitioning from the cult of war to the culture of peace.
             </p>
             <p>
              We should not forget that, when women are marginalised and ignored, there is little chance for the world to get sustainable peace in the real sense. I believe it is critical, as we embark on this mission to defeat IS, that we must be conscious of the need to involve the women of Iraq and Syria, the women who have been the victims of IS's barbarity, in the process at every step of the way.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the time I have left, I would like to focus on what is going on not in Iraq and Syria but right here in Australia. Specifically, I would like to reiterate that right now it is more important than ever that we are united and inclusive as a society, as Australians. As the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for citizenship and multiculturalism said today in an open letter to the Islamic community:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Labor stands shoulder to shoulder with Australia's Islamic community and, now more than ever, we are committed to tolerance, social cohesion, mutual respect and multiculturalism.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Labor will continue to work with you to stop misinformation, bigotry and prejudice directed at the Australian Islamic community.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Regrettably, some in our community, including a very few elected representatives, have made comments which have the potential to damage community harmony and inflame tensions. Labor strongly opposes these ill-informed and dangerous views and we will continue to speak out against them.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We know that the twisted ideology of ISIL bears no relation to a faith of peace, love and tolerance which is followed by millions around the world—and we will continue to make this point.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              ISIL has no right to use the name of Islam.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Islamic community here in Canberra is an incredibly important part of my electorate. I am very much looking forward to attending the Canberra Islamic Centre's open day next month on 25 October. I encourage any members who are in Canberra on that day to come along. This open day is a chance to say thank you to the Canberra community for the support it has shown the Islamic centre this year.
             </p>
             <p>
              Earlier this year—and I have spoken about it in the chamber before—the Canberra Islamic Centre was the victim of a terrible act of vandalism. Vandals broke into the centre and damaged and destroyed absolutely everything they could get their hands on. Sadly, this was not the first time the centre had been the victim of a vandal attack. The response from the Canberra community was astounding. Canberrans from all faiths, from all backgrounds and of all ages banded together to help clean up the centre. In fact, on the weekend after the attack, there were more volunteers at the centre to help with the clean-up than they could fit into the actual building. It was quite extraordinary seeing all these members of the Canberra community out there, with their buckets, mops and brooms, rolling up their sleeves and getting in there with the elbow grease to clean up the centre but also to send a very, very strong message that Canberra has zero tolerance for this kind of malicious vandalism. This is the kind of community spirit that we must foster again, right now. We must be united, we must show tolerance and we must show respect.
