        Today is Every Australian Counts day, but for the 269,000 people living with dementia it is not always the case. Dementia, which includes
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Disease" rel="nofollow">
         Alzheimer's Disease
        </a>
        , is a disease that robs people of their memories, their intellect and their ability to manage daily life. In 2005 the coalition made dementia a national health priority, committing $320 million over five years to help fund the Dementia Initiative. But earlier this year the Gillard government scrapped this initiative, and with it the guarantee of funding for services and support desperately needed by people living with this condition. Today, when every Australian should count, many people with dementia do not. They face a future of desperation, struggle and isolation, and they deserve better.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alzheimer's Australia warns that within 10 years the number of people with dementia in this country will increase by nearly 50 per cent. Already, Australia has 1.2 million carers, who save this country $5.5 billion each year. Many of them have given up their own dreams, careers and lives to care for partners or family members affected by this disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition recognises the debilitating impact this disease has on our community and the growing challenges it presents. At the last election the coalition committed an additional $50 million over four years to expand the Dementia Initiative to include other chronic neurological conditions, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_Disease" rel="nofollow">
         Parkinson's Disease
        </a>
        . To prepare the health system for the 58 per cent increase in dementia cases over the next 10 years is paramount. The coalition remains committed to improving the level of resources dedicated to fighting dementia. Urgent action is needed now to address this epidemic, in the same way that we tackle cancer and heart disease. Alzheimer's Australia also warns that dementia is one of the fastest-growing chronic diseases. It is already the third-biggest killer in Australia. Alzheimer's Australia put forward a five-point action plan that leads the way. They say we need to: (1) raise the awareness of the impact of this devastating disease; (2) speed up the diagnosis so that people can prepare earlier; (3) improve the quality of dementia care, especially outside the main urban areas; (4) invest in dementia research to find the cause and a cure; and (5) importantly, tell people what they can do to reduce their risk of developing dementia—that is, what is good for the heart is good for the head.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today hundreds of concerned Australians are gathering outside parliament to raise awareness of the plight faced by people with dementia and to demand more from the Gillard government. They are being led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita_Buttrose" rel="nofollow">
         Ita Buttrose
        </a>
        , the new national president of Alzheimer's Australia. They are determined to be heard and, with that formidable lady at the helm, I have no doubt that they will be.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also met with a number of my constituents who have shared their stories about living with dementia. While they remain stoic and determined to live well, the impact of dementia on them is undeniable. For example, today I learnt that, in my electorate of Wright, more than 1,200 people have been diagnosed with dementia, including nearly 300 who are under the age of 65. When you add their families and carers to that figure, there are more than 7,500 people in my electorate facing the reality of living with dementia. Their lives will never be the same. Even worse is that the number of people with dementia is growing. By 2050, nearly one million Australians will be grappling with dementia and, as decision makers of this nation, we will all be dealing with the health, social and economic impacts of this disease. I am told that, by 2050, the incidence of dementia—that is, new cases—will rise by 735 per cent in my electorate and that, in terms of the prevalence of dementia, my electorate will be in the top 10 federal electorates—a very sobering thought. On a day when every Australian counts, I am thinking of them and I will not forget them. I repeat: I will not forget them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Briefly, I want to take the opportunity to speak about some neighbours of mine, Jack and Bernice McNevan. Bernice suffers from dementia. Bernice was in the early stages of her dementia when I went there to catch up with them. Jack said that Bernice was really getting bad and that she may not remember me. As I met her at the house, she said, 'Oh, I haven't seen you for a while.' I jested with her and said, 'Bernice, I was here yesterday.' She said: 'I'm not that far gone. I know if you were here yesterday there would be no food left in the house.' So I wish Bernice well, although she is now in a care facility. It is a struggle. I encourage all members here to be aware of Alzheimer's and its impact on their communities.
