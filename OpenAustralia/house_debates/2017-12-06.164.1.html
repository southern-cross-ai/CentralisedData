        The electorate of Ryan is blessed with thousands of volunteers and the contribution of local not-for-profit organisations, and their contribution is immense. No matter which corner of my electorate I travel to, there is always a wonderful organisation that supports the community in a variety of ways. The volunteers and staff work hard, often with little recognition, to ensure the upkeep of their facilities and their services. However, as we all know, community organisations require some funding to maintain their operations. For too long some of my local groups have survived on the smell of an oily rag. However, I am pleased to say that, as a result of the Stronger Communities Program, Christmas has come early to some local community groups in my electorate of Ryan.

        Stronger Communities helps deliver social benefits in communities across Australia. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight just a few of the successful recipients, including the Bardon Girl Guides. This Guides group have successfully sought funding to upgrade their hut. Through the upgrade and extension of the hut, the Bardon Girl Guides will provide a sheltered facility for other community groups as well as growing their own local participation. Another one is Bardon Latrobe Football Club. With more than 450 junior and senior members, the club will be able to upgrade their field and playing facilities to grow participation and also provide a place for other community groups to conduct their activities. And the Moggill Pony Club, an institution with a long history in the local area, have been utilising ageing facilities for their events. With this funding the Moggill Pony Club can now look to build suitable shelter facilities for their much-loved horses.

        —the mighty Rovers soccer club—has been plagued by poor maintenance shed facilities. With this funding the Rovers will be able to expand their shed to ensure that vital equipment and mowers are kept secure. This grant program will also support Ewaste Connection. In addition, the Pullenvale Progress Association is doing wonderful events for the local community at Pullenvale Hall, originally used as a pineapple-packing facility. Also,

        The Stronger Communities Program, as the name implies, provides just that: a stronger community. I would like to thank all those within my electorate of Ryan who contribute so much to their local area. I look forward to visiting you all in the near future.
