        No, I'm not talking about the Labor Party working together in opposition to the infighting on the other side. However, I can see why there might be some confusion. It's an easy mistake to make. I'm talking about the

        </a>
        activity for young people aged nine to 16. These teams work across three months to build and code an autonomous robot made from LEGO and then compete against other schools in a variety of different challenges. Along the way, students are judged on their design, their programming and the robustness of the robot, as well as on their teamwork.

        The students competing at Cecil Andrews were given the task of creating a solution for long-term living in space. One team proposed an entire space Olympics, while another designed ways to recycle waste in space, to reuse plastic, metal and paper. Congratulations to Cecil Andrews College, the Armadale Robotics Clubs and all 34 teams that competed from around Perth, and especially from many local schools through the electorate of Burt and Perth's south-eastern suburbs. Congratulations to Gwynne Park Primary School, Greenwood College and Clifton Hill's Primary School, which all advanced to the next round of the tournament. Everything is awesome, especially you.
