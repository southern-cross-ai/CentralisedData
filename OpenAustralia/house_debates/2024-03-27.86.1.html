        My question is to the Minister for Transport. How is the Albanese Labor government's New Vehicle Efficiency Standard delivering for Australians where previous governments couldn't?

         I very much thank the member for Reid for that question. She is someone who wants her constituents to benefit from fuel savings and from having more efficient cars, whether petrol, diesel, hybrid or electric, than there would be in the Australian market. This morning I introduced the Albanese government's New Vehicle Efficiency Standard legislation into the parliament, and after a quarter of a century of failed attempts Australia will finally have a New Vehicle Efficiency Standard—a standard that will deliver Australians more choice of new cars, will save Australians thousands at the bowser and will reduce our emissions. It is a model where Australians will continue to be able to buy the utes and the

         s that they love.

         The shadow spokesperson for transport let the cat out of the bag yesterday when her sole contribution to the public debate on this matter was to gloat about the fact that her government shut down the Australian car manufacturing industry. Despite being in government for two separate periods this century, that is their only policy contribution to the automotive sector in this country. While the Liberals and Nationals are gloating over and over again about destroying local manufacturing jobs, the Albanese Labor government is delivering Australians a greater choice of cleaner, cheaper-to-run cars.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that the member for Bradfield is contributing. I understand that he's disappointed he was not able to get an efficiency standard when he was in government. Well, this side is delivering it, and I look forward to you voting for it, Member for Bradfield.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite being in government for, as I said, two separate periods this century, those opposite failed to deliver on their own policy of an efficiency standard. The Minister for

         </a>
         and Energy and I have undertaken significant consultation with the industry and with climate groups in developing this standard, and we thank everyone who has engaged constructively with us through this process. I note that those opposite are of course not amongst that group, having yesterday said that they'd vote against the legislation, before it had even been tabled and before they had even seen it—nothing new about that. I'd particularly like to acknowledge Toyota, Hyundai, Tesla, the Motor Trades Association, the Automobile Dealer Association and the Electric Vehicle Council for their positive engagement, and all the other manufacturers who engaged constructively with our offices.

         Australians have, frankly, been left behind as consumers while the most advanced economies across the world benefit from more fuel-efficient cars and greater access to new low and net zero technology. Together with Russia, we were one of the only advanced economies that did not regulate the efficiency of new vehicles. It's time we got on with it. It's time we provided greater choice to Australian consumers so that they can benefit from the fuel savings that a fuel efficiency standard brings to everyone.
