        This week in the parliament I had the opportunity to be present at a function hosted by the National Stroke Foundation. The National Stroke Foundation's objectives were to raise awareness about stroke victims in our community. One of the things I learned is that they do not like being called stroke victims. They are stroke survivors and they are proud survivors.

        Present with that group were some people from my electorate up in Queensland, the electorate of Wright, Brian and

        So, please, I encourage those who are interested to learn more about stroke victims, or stroke survivors, to contact www.strokefoundation.com.au, and I commend them.
