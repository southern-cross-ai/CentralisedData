       <p>
        I recently visited the Police Ranger Unit at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Greenwood Senior High School
        </a>
        . This was to observe at first hand the training being undertaken and to thank those that have volunteered in the running of the unit. I have always considered that activities such as those of the police rangers are very good for the development of young people and also serve as a reminder of their community responsibilities. On the evening that I visited Greenwood Senior High School I observed the rangers undertaking drill practice and then problem-solving challenges. It was clear to me that the rangers enjoyed the activities they performed and appreciated the support and efforts of the adults and peer leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the second time that I have specifically spoken in parliament about the activities and good work of a police ranger unit. Although I had heard of the Greenwood unit before, in one of my previous visits to the Greenwood Senior High School, and also through people in the community, my visit originated from a visit to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WA_Police" rel="nofollow">
         WA Police
        </a>
        ’s North West Metro District Crime Prevention and Diversity Unit. I was in the unit’s office speaking with Sergeant Bob O’Sullivan when I met Tessa Morawski. Tessa, I understand, is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        suburb manager for Koondoola, a suburb that I have also previously spoken about. Apart from her volunteering in that capacity, Tessa Morawski is also the unit coordinator—the leader of the Greenwood Police Rangers. She explained to me what the rangers were about and who were involved as adult and peer leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of that discussion I then visited the school and the ranger unit. As part of my visit I thanked all the leaders for the work they do for the members of the unit. I also take the opportunity to acknowledge the work done and the commitment displayed in their own time by those leaders. Apart from the unit coordinator, Tessa Morawski, I would also like to acknowledge Shaun MacLeod, the assistant unit coordinator, Chief Instructor David Williams, and Instructors Michele and Shaun Coles. On that night they had a visiting instructor, Detective Constable First Class Jayd Morawski, whom I also thanked for his work with police rangers out in Kalgoorlie.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also appropriate that I mention the police ranger peer leaders of the unit, Ranger Senior Sergeant Tom Marneweck, Ranger Sergeants Jake Pengilly, Ayndrea and Emily Grant, Ranger First Class Ryan Demarteau and Ranger Mark Reilly. It is my understanding that these leaders have been of great assistance to the adult leaders and perform their roles very well. I feel confident that they will continue to be positive influences in their schools and in their community for years to come. I hold the police rangers and their leaders in high regard and I consider the Greenwood Police Rangers to be a very good organisation, and their host school Greenwood Senior High should be very proud of them for their contributions to the community.
