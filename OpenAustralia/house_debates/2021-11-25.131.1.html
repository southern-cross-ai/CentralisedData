        I want to talk about two very important milestones in my community in 2021: a man who made it through his first century and is embarking on his second and a local organisation that's joining the growing third-century club of Parramatta.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just before lockdown, I had the honour of joining the celebration of Eric Tweedale's 100th birthday. Eric is famously Australia's oldest living Wallaby. He was drafted into the Wallabies in 1946, after serving in the Navy in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and played prop-forward—front-row forward—for Australia until 1949. In Parramatta, he is best known for inspiring generations of our young people to play rugby.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born in England, Eric moved to Australia with his family when he was three. They settled in Merrylands. He went to Guildford Public School and then Parramatta Intermediate School on the site that is now

        </a>
        . He played his first game of rugby on

        in 1937, and at 17 he was selected to play for Parramatta, now known as the Western Sydney Two Blues. He would play for the club on and off for the next 21 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Eric retired from playing, he took up coaching and was instrumental in setting up junior rugby in Parramatta. As a coach, Eric wasn't focused on winning. It was all about having a go. The strength of the game in the middle of rugby league heartland is a testament to his influence on generations of Two Blues players. This year, their home ground in Granville was named the Eric Tweedale Stadium in his honour. I want to wish Eric Tweedale a very happy 100th birthday once again and thank the Merrylands

        Club and the Western Sydney Two Blues for allowing me to join the celebrations earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The year 2021 is the 200th anniversary of Paramatta Mission. It's been an extraordinary two centuries. Parramatta Mission has been serving my community since Parramatta's first Wesleyan chapel was founded on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Street
        </a>
        in 1821. Today, they do the work that nobody else does. No matter who you are or what you are going through, you can find a space at Parramatta Mission—a safe one. Their Meals Plus service provides hot meals Monday to Friday, more than 46,000 meals every year. Anyone who comes in for a meal can also access laundry and shower facilities and get help with legal and financial issues, Centrelink and housing. I've used their services many times when a person has walked into my office. They are the ones you go to for immediate help. Most importantly, they can find someone to talk to who will listen without judgement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank all the amazing staff and volunteers at Parramatta Mission, who do amazing work in my community every day. We would not be the community we are without Parramatta Mission. Congratulations on an extraordinary first two centuries. I know that you will absolutely rock your third century.
