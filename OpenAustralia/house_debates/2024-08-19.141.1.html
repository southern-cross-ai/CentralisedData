       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges the popularity of the Government's Fee-Free TAFE policy, demonstrated by 500,000 enrolments since its commencement;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that Fee-Free TAFE is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) driving enrolments in sectors with recognised skills shortages and securing a domestic workforce to deliver on current and future priorities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) giving Australians access to the skills they need to ensure they have meaningful, well-paid jobs, and career progression;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) helping to ease cost of living pressures to make training a real possibility for half a million Australians; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) assisting the country's response to the biggest skills shortages we have faced in 50 years; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) supports the Government as it continues to invest in the Australian people by rolling out Fee-Free TAFE places in partnership with state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise to speak to this excellent motion on the first day of National Skills Week—and what a fantastic week it is. No government has done more to support Australians getting the skills they need than the Albanese Labor government. Over 500,000 people have been supported by fee-free TAFE since the beginning of the program on 1 January 2023; that is an astonishing number. In the first year of fee-free TAFE in 2023, there were over 355,000 students enrolled against a target of 180,000 places. Importantly, fee-free TAFE is supporting disadvantaged and in need Australians, with 35,000 people with disability and over 30,000 First Nations Australians taking up opportunities provided by fee-free TAFE.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my beautiful electorate of Dunkley, over 2,000 apprentices are currently working towards a nationally recognised qualification because of the program. It's motivating to see Dunkley residents benefiting from the fantastic opportunities that Labor governments provide. Fee-free TAFE has changed the lives of so many, helping address skills shortages and helping students by removing financial barriers. Fee-free TAFE is not wasteful spending, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has described; it's an investment in people and their ability to have a career, and the ability to support people into jobs in building and construction, child care and nursing—areas where we have skills shortages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst I did not benefit from fee-free TAFE when I was a young woman studying to be a youth worker, TAFE certainly changed my life for the better. After working as a secretary I went to study youth work and community development at what is now
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisholm_TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         Chisholm TAFE
        </a>
        , keen to build the skills and knowledge to enable me to have a career supporting young people who are disadvantaged. My experience at TAFE was incredibly empowering. It was the impetus for me realising my capabilities and my passion supporting others to reach their potential. Studying at TAFE was the first of many steps in a love of lifelong learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        TAFE gave me the confidence to go on and complete other study. I have now completed many other postgraduate qualifications. The last course I completed was a certificate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
         IV
        </a>
        in training and education—which enabled me to become a TAFE teacher, supporting others to study youth work and community development. Now, my niece and a close friend are taking up the opportunity fee-free TAFE provides. My niece has just applied for nursing, and Jemma, from Rosie's Cafe, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_South" rel="nofollow">
         Frankston South
        </a>
        , has just commenced studying a certificate IV in child care at Chisholm TAFE. Jemma said to me just yesterday:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Starting the certificate III in early childhood education has been such a positive experience. It feels good to be pursuing something I am passionate about and that I feel can make a meaningful impact to the future of our society.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Fee free TAFE has helped me begin my journey to a career that I am passionate about, and I look forward with nothing but excitement to the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        This testimonial says it all, doesn't it? Jemma is just one of the many people who wanted the opportunity to learn and have a career, and needed the financial support to make this a reality. By removing financial barriers to study, fee-free TAFE is giving Australians from all walks of life the opportunity to get a secure, well-paid job with career progression, with training provided in areas of high demand and skills need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best part is it is women who make up the majority of enrolments—almost 63 per cent—with over 277,000 women taking on a qualification under this initiative. We know through the work of the Minister for Women,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
         Katy Gallagher
        </a>
        , that the cost to the Australian economy for women being underemployed is $28 billion per annum. Fee-free TAFE is mobilising more women into education, which leads to employment and, for many—like me—a career. Fee-free TAFE is an exceptional policy achieving exceptional outcomes.

          <p>
           Australia certainly needs top-class, effective training. However, it won't just be the number of enrolments and commencements that are the measure of whether the $1.5 billion of taxpayers' money that the Labor government is spending on this policy is actually being spent wisely. The true test will be whether each one of the students complete these courses, meaning the completion and the qualification rates will be the measure of success for this policy, as will whether the students are genuinely skilled, job ready and able to do the jobs the employers actually require. Equally, in regional areas, a measure of success will be whether the students are training in the areas of particular workforce shortages.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are already concerns given that the estimates of TAFE completions are showing the failure, or non-completion, rate could be as high as 55 to 60 per cent. For example, in Victoria, just one per cent of those registered for a free certificate
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
            IV
           </a>
           in plumbing successfully completed their training. Labor speakers talking today need to confirm just how many of Labor's 500,000 fee-free TAFE courses have resulted in a real qualification being completed, leading to a real qualified worker. Taxpayers have a right to know how many cancellations or noncompletions there have been across those enrolments and, equally, how many of these enrolments were not genuinely new places, as opposed to those that were going to be there anyway, without that additional $1.5 billion cost to taxpayers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason these details are so important is that, under Labor, skills are going backwards, so completion and qualification rates are critical. The latest data released by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research shows that Australia has lost over 85,300 apprentices and trainees from the national training pipeline since the Labor government took office—a loss of one in five. This means Labor has squandered almost all the gains made by the coalition government in building up Australia's skills pipeline. It also comes at a time when Labor is bringing in over 1.15 million migrants, which is putting extraordinary pressure on housing, infrastructure, hospitals, schools and health services—and of course we're building only 265,000 new homes. At the same time, we're seeing worsening skills shortages, unaffordable and soaring energy costs, stalling housing constructions and record insolvencies in the building sector itself. No wonder there are 5,300 fewer construction trades worker apprentices in training since Labor took office. Added to this, new-start apprentices and trainees have dropped by 23 per cent, the number of female apprentices and trainees in training has fallen by 25 per cent and the number of female commencements has fallen by 40 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>
           The harsh reality facing the Australian people, with Labor's shocking economic failure and the additional $315 billion of new spending driving homegrown inflation, is that Australia is building fewer homes and the skills shortage has become far worse. We've lost one in five apprentices and trainees across the country, and Australians cannot find accommodation, housing or rental properties. Australia needs more apprentices and trainees, not fewer, for businesses of all sizes, from small and medium family businesses through to major businesses and industries. Labor promised they would solve the skills shortages. Well, they haven't done so. Unfortunately, it's just another broken promise made to the Australian people, along with the broken promises to lower power prices, to fix the cost-of-living issues and to lower mortgage costs, amongst so many other broken promises.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to Jobs and Skills Australia, 36 per cent of occupations were assessed as being in shortage in 2023, up from 31 per cent in 2022, and 66 occupations were added to this list in 2023. Effectively, this means over 330 occupations are in shortage in Australia. Clearly, the 1.15 million migrants Labor has opened Australia's doors to have not filled and are not filling these shortages because Labor has failed to target skilled migrants in its open-door migration policy and has failed to support and train Australian apprentices and trainees in the numbers that are needed. To add insult to injury, not only has the new Minister for Skills and Training role been taken out of cabinet but it's clearly not a priority for the Labor government.

           <p>
            As we begin National Skills Week, it is time to celebrate and acknowledge the importance of skills development and vocational education in Australia. This week we stand at a crossroads where our commitment to education and training meets the growing needs of industries crucial to our nation's future. There is no better example of this commitment than the fee-free TAFE program, a program designed to support Australians in gaining the skills they need to secure well-paid jobs in industries that are experiencing critical skills shortages. Since its inception on 1 January 2023, fee-free TAFE has already provided over half a million Australians with the opportunity to pursue education and training without the financial burden of tuition fees. That's half a million individuals, many from vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, who are now on the path to a brighter future, whether they're training to be care workers, tradies or technology specialists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond individual benefits, fee-free TAFE is about more than just education; it is a critical component in addressing the growing skills shortage in key sectors that are essential to our national growth and resilience. In particular, the care industry, technology and digital sectors, early childhood education and care, and construction are all facing substantial shortages that we must fill if we want to remain competitive on the global stage.
           </p>
           <p>
            The results speak for themselves. In its first year alone, fee-free TAFE has supported over 355,000 student enrolments—almost double the initial target of 180,000 places. Enrolments across priority sectors have been especially strong, with over 120,000 in the care sector, over 45,000 in technology and digital, and 32,000 in early childhood education and construction. These aren't just numbers on a page; they represent real lives being transformed, real gaps being filled and real progress being made in securing our nation's future workforce.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we launch the future fee-free TAFE, it's well on track to continue making an impact. Through an historic partnership with states and territories, the Albanese Labor government has committed over $1.5 billion to deliver 500,000 fee-free TAFE places between 2023 and 2026. This investment isn't just an expenditure; it's a down payment on a better Australia, one with a skilled workforce ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are proud that fee-free TAFE is not just addressing skills shortages but also targeting priority groups who have historically faced barriers to education and employment. Among those enrolled, along with 158,000 young people, are over 117,000 jobseekers, almost 35,000 people with disabilities and over 30,000 First Nations Australians. These are the individuals who need support the most, and fee-free TAFE is providing that support by removing financial barriers and offering them a path to secure, fulfilling careers. But let's be clear. This isn't just about statistics and policies; it's about real savings for everyday Australians. Students training in critical fields like childhood education and civil construction have saved thousands of dollars thanks to fee-free TAFE.
           </p>
           <p>
            While we celebrate the success of fee-free TAFE, it's important to acknowledge that not everyone shares this vision. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has described fee-free TAFE as wasteful spending. Yet the evidence is clear. Fee-free TAFE is not only providing Australians with the skills they need to get ahead but also strengthening the workforce in industries that are desperate for qualified workers. What is even more concerning is that the opposition has offered no alternative plan. At a time when Australia faces critical shortages in key industries, they have refused to support additional fee-free TAFE and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
             VET
            </a>
            places.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every Australian deserves a chance to secure a well-paid, stable job with career progression. Every industry vital to our future deserves the workforce it needs to thrive. That is why we have put TAFE at the heart of our vocational educational and training sector. We understand that a strong VET sector is key to providing Australians with the training they need to secure a brighter future. By working with the states and territories to deliver fee-free TAFE, we're ensuring that our investment is reaching those who need it the most, and that is having a real impact on addressing the skills shortages that we face.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we begin National Skills Week, let us celebrate the transformative power of education and training; let us commit to continuing to build a strong, resilient and skilled workforce; and let us stand firm in our belief that investing in the skills of our people is the surest way to invest in the future of Australia.

            <p>
             One of the most important investments any government can make is in education. When we invest in education we're investing in the future of our country. Unfortunately, the previous government neglected key parts of our education system, particularly TAFE. The consequences have been clear. When we came into government, we faced nationwide skills shortages.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not an economist, but I am a proud TAFE graduate, so I know that, when you make it harder and less affordable for people to attend TAFE, you end up with Australian businesses struggling to find skilled workers. You end up with skill shortages, but we are fixing this. Fee-free TAFE is helping Australians study in areas where we need skills the most, like future care workers and tradies. The evidence shows that this is working. Fee-free TAFE is on track to boost the supply of skilled workers in critical industries, particularly in care, technology and digital, early childhood education and construction. This policy is nation building and life changing for everyone who is now getting a free tertiary-level education.
            </p>

             Our approach, when it comes to getting people trained in the area of their choice, is quite different to those opposite. Those opposite have never cared about TAFE, and they never will. That's why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition described fee-free TAFE as 'wasteful spending'. But it's not just one of their opinions on that side. Their disregard for TAFE is deeply ingrained. Let's not forget that there wasn't a single skills policy in the opposition's budget reply speech. They have refused to back our additional fee-free TAFE and

             places for construction, our expanded access to new energy apprentices, our expanded capacity for training facilities and the trainer workforce, our support for women's careers in VET, or our increased financial support to prioritise apprentices and their employers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every time we have tried to rebuild TAFE, they have tried to stand in the way, but this hasn't stopped us from getting on with the job. We have delivered fee-free TAFE, helping hundreds of thousands of Australians pursue the jobs of their choice. The early data reported by states and territories, up to 30 June this year, tells us that fee-free TAFE has helped create over 500,000 enrolments nationally since it commenced on 1 January 2023. We had a target of 180,000 places in the first year of fee-free TAFE in 2023. But we didn't just deliver on this; we overdelivered. We smashed our target, with over 355,000 student enrolments. This shows that, when TAFE is affordable and accessible, people will seize this opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Enrolments in fee-free TAFE have been strong across all priority sectors. We've had over 120,000 care sector course enrolments. There were over 45,000 technology and digital sector course enrolments. There were nearly 32,000 early childhood education and care sector enrolments and over 32,000 construction sector course enrolments. Just think about everything that will get done with the extra few hundred thousand skilled workers that we have.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm a proud product of TAFE. It taught me the skills that I needed to be able to gain the good, secure employment which has supported me for the whole of my working life. It also taught me the important lessons about life. Leaving school at 15 to do my trade, I was thrown into the real world very quickly. But this has helped shape the person I am today. School was never for me. I never loved it, and I definitely never thought about going to university. I will be forever grateful that I was able to go to TAFE and learn the skills and live the experiences I have had.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're a young person right now and don't think school is quite for you and don't want to go to university, that's okay. TAFE gives you the chance to get qualifications in doing something you love. Whether you want to be a chippie, a leco, a plumber, a boiley, a mechanic, a tiler, a plasterer or a childcare educator or to have a qualification in hospitality, or maybe you want to be a fitter and turner just like me, we want to make sure that you're able to go to TAFE and get a high-quality qualification that opens doors for you into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
             So let's keep pushing to make trades not just a viable option but a sought-after career path. Tradies are cool. Let's make sure we get the next generation on board and keep pushing tradies along. We need them to keep Australia going.
