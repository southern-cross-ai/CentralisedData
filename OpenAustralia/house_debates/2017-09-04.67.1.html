        Minister for the Environment and Energy, crocodiles are now killing North Queenslanders at almost one a year. There are sightings at our tourism beaches and attacks on dogs almost weekly. Humans of unbalanced natures are introducing toads and protecting crocodiles. Gropers ate the baby crocodiles and the gropers are gone. Goannas and pythons ate the eggs and they are both gone. The biggest predators are my First Australian brothers—gone. They were told by white fellas far, far away that after 40,000 years they can't hunt crocs or harvest eggs. Would the minister agree that Premier Palaszczuk ain't gonna become no Cleopatra no matter how many human sacrifices she makes to the crocodile river gods?

         in putting people before sharks. I know that on our side of the House, we have the original crocodile hunter in the member of Leichhardt. I understand that he's turned a nice pair of crocodile skins into a nice pair of boots for two previous

         On a more serious note, we have expressed concern about the rise in crocodile-related fatalities. There have been ten deaths in the last six years including in places like

          Cape Tribulation

         , and, clearly, we have seen an increase in the number of crocodiles particularly in areas that are human inhabited. I know in the member's own electorate that in Mareeba crocodiles have come into the area and should never have been allowed in that area.

         Act, crocodiles are listed as a migratory species, but, as the honourable member knows, it is under state legislation in Queensland where crocodiles are listed as a vulnerable species. We call upon the Palaszczuk government to take stronger action to put people first. I know that the
