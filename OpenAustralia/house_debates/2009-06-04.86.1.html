        My question is to the Minister for

         Defence Science
        </a>
        and Personnel. Did the minister instruct the commander of health services in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIB" rel="nofollow">
         NIB
        </a>
        , Mr Mark Fitzgibbon, on 3 July 2008 and again on 27 August 2008? Will the minister confirm to the House that he issued these instructions after a request from the former Minister for Defence?

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. Let me just outline the events that took place so that we understand precisely where we are at. A letter from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIB" rel="nofollow">
          NIB
         </a>
         seeking a meeting to discuss healthcare proposals was received by the Minister for Defence in late June last year. In accordance with the ministerial code of conduct, it would have been absolutely improper for the minister to deal with that correspondence and it was properly referred to me as the minister responsible for health in the Defence portfolio. The letter was referred to my office on 26 June at the direction of the minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         A preliminary meeting that included the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of NIB, Mr Mark Fitzgibbon, members of my staff and departmental staff from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
          DVA
         </a>
         and Defence was held on 3 July. A further meeting with representatives of NIB and Humana was held on 27 August. It was attended by Minister Griffin and me, along with staff from our offices and Major General Paul Alexander.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since that meeting, Defence has had no further contact with either company. I will just repeat that: since that meeting, Defence has had no further contact with either company. This was a matter which was rightly dealt with by me, not the Minister for Defence. I was the minister responsible for defence health and at all times behaved in accordance with the ministerial code of conduct.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, relating to relevance. I asked: did he issue an instruction to Major General Paul Alexander to meet?

           The minister responded to the question. I believe the minister has concluded his answer.
