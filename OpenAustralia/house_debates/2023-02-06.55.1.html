       <p>
        Given this is the first opportunity for me to get to my feet in this 48th parliament, it is with great sadness that I wish to offer my sincere condolences on the passing of Senator Jim Molan. While I appreciate there will be other provisions in this House for us to offer our condolences, I wanted to honour our friendship, and him, by making him my first speech in this parliament. Senator Molan was a respected and dedicated public servant who devoted his life to serving our country and to its people. He was a true patriot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Molan's work history is truly impressive. He served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        for more than 40 years and rose through the ranks to become major-general. He also served as Chief of Operations for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        in Iraq. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the deployment of troops overseas and for the development of strategic military plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Molan was equally committed to his service to his country as a senator for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . He was appointed to the Senate in 2017 and quickly established himself as a champion of veterans, their families and New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Jim Molan will be deeply missed by all who knew him, especially his wife, Anne; his daughters, Sarah, Erin and Felicity; and his son, Michael. He was a true patriot and dedicated public servant who devoted his life to serving his country and his people. I'll miss you, my friend. Rest in peace.
