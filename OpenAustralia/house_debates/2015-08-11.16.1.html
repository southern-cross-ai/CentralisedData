        Darwin recently hosted the

        </a>
        world group quarter-final, played for the first time on Australian soil in many years. I was privileged to attend this event, and I have to say that the atmosphere in the arena was electric. Visitors came from interstate and overseas to enjoy the first-class, international-standard event, and I am so proud to say that they also got to experience the unique

        Locals were treated to some top-class tennis through this once-in-a-lifetime event in Darwin. I commend the work of Tennis

        this wonderful opportunity. It showed the faith that they had in us to be able to put on this amazing event.

       <p>
        Forty-eight local volunteers and 22 talented youngsters from Darwin, Palmerston and the rural area acted as ball kids, and all were integral to the smooth running of this event. These Territorians definitely did us proud. It was great to see these volunteers have the opportunity to play a role on the court during the tie between Australia and Kazakhstan. To share the court with some of Australia's best male tennis players is an opportunity that every young sports fan dreams of. I spoke to some of the ball kids, and they were saying to me that they were so impressedâ€”
