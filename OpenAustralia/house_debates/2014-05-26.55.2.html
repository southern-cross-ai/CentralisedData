         and it is a perfectly appropriate question for the Leader of the Opposition to kick off question time with today. I am very pleased to be able to reassure the Leader of the Opposition that while we are making some savings in this area, as we are making savings across the board, we believe that by collapsing some 100 separate programs into five broad programs we can achieve efficiencies in service delivery that will mean, with somewhat less money, that we will achieve better outcomes. This is our objective: to achieve better outcomes for the Indigenous people of our country. What we are absolutely committed to doing is to ensuring that children go to school, that adults go to work and that people are safe in their own homes. These changes were thoroughly discussed with the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council. As anyone who had read Warren Mundine's speech given last weekend would know, the council is satisfied that the government are heading in the right direction.

           Australia does have a fundamentally strong economy, but under the former Labor government the budget was fundamentally weak. So we had a fundamentally strong economy but a fundamentally weak budget. What this government is doing is fixing the budget to strengthen our economy—and didn't it need fixing. The former government, the Labor Party, inherited a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, and they gave the people of Australia the six biggest deficits in our history. They gave us debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see—$123 billion in cumulative projected deficits and $667 billion in projected gross debt. Thanks to the policies pursued by members opposite, this country is borrowing a billion dollars every single month just to pay interest on the borrowings. Under the policies of members opposite, within a decade that mean $3 billion would have to be borrowed every single month—enough to fund the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            Western Sydney
           </a>
           infrastructure package, which this government are getting on with.
          </p>
          <p>
           You cannot keep putting the mortgage on the credit card, which is what members opposite have done. This government did not create the problem, but we are shouldering responsibility for fixing it. Under us, instead of a $30 billion deficit in 2017-18, the deficit will come in at under $3 billion and debt will be $300 billion less under the policies that we announced in the budget. This is what the government was elected to do. We were elected to take the tough decisions necessary to get this country back on track and that is exactly what we are doing. Every day before the election, we made it crystal clear what we were doing: we would stop the boats, we would scrap the carbon tax and we would build the road to the 21st century and we would get the budget back under control, and that is precisely what this government are doing.

                       <p>
                        I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I recognise that he, like most other Australians, knows that we have to do something about the legacy of $667 billion of debt that would have been in place had we not taken the decisions that we took on budget night. It is about getting the budget back on track. That was one of our key election promises: to fix the budget, to fix the mess that Labor left. At the moment we are paying a billion dollars a month—one billion dollars every month in interest on the debt that Labor has left. This would be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time if nothing is done. That is $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time if nothing is done about the state of the budget. Under the legacy of the previous government, each Australian's share of the interest would be $9,400 over the next 10 years. In four years time alone, if nothing is done, every single Australian will be paying the equivalent of $740 in interest alone on Labor's debt—$740 each.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        To put that in perspective, as the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
                         IMF
                        </a>
                        identified, we were left with a legacy of the third fastest growth in net debt of the surveyed countries by the IMF. What does that mean? That means that, ultimately, as interest rates rise, the punitive measures a future government would need to take to fix the budget would be more dramatic. We need to take action now. We must take action now, because the pain associated with taking action in the future would be far greater if we went down the path that the Labor Party is advocating—that is, do nothing. When you do nothing you become a victim of circumstances. When you take action you have at least a chance to control your destiny. The coalition is firmly of the view that we must take action now to repair the budget and to reduce the level of debt burden that is being passed on to future generations of Australians.

                         My question is to the Prime Minister. There are 8,429 families currently receiving family tax benefit B in the seat of Capricornia. How many families with children over the age of six in Capricornia will have their payments cut as a result of this budget? Why should these families suffer because of the member for Capricornia's failure to stand up against the Prime Minister's cuts?

                            Shock! Horror! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has discovered that some people will be impacted by budget decisions. Of course some people will be impacted by budget decisions. We could not go on as a nation giving people borrowed money that our nation cannot afford and that the government cannot sustain. Because of the pseudogenerosity of members opposite, this country was in an absolutely unsustainable situation—

                              borrowing a billion every single month just to pay interest on the borrowings. That situation was simply unsustainable. The thing about the budget is that it is a contribute-and-build budget. High-income earners will pay the deficit levy. Members of parliament will face a pay freeze. Motorists will pay the fuel excise indexation. Everyone is making a contribution so that our country will be better off in the long run, and that is what we were elected to do: to get the budget back under control so that our country will be better and stronger in the long run. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is so concerned about the welfare of the people of Capricornia, then scrap the carbon tax. That will save every household in Capricornia $550 a year.
