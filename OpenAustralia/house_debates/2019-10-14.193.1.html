        In moments of hardship, trauma and tragedy we see our community's resilient spirit shine. Our emergency services personnel selflessly put themselves in harm's way to ensure that our community is safe. In my electorate of Lindsay in the last few weeks we have seen extraordinary actions in the service of others. I would like to recognise the bravery and professionalism of the Nepean Police Area Command officers and emergency response personnel, who encountered the dangerous situation of shootings taking place both at St Marys Police Station and at Penrith Police Station, which is right next door to my office, on the evening of 2 October. My best wishes are with the officer who was injured in the incident. We wish you a swift and complete recovery.

        , in Castlereagh and across the state, has undoubtedly saved lives, homes and businesses.

        I often say that in Lindsay we are full to the brim and overflowing with community spirit. We are fortunate to live in a community with those who sacrifice so much in the service of others. On behalf of the community I represent, I express my sincere gratitude to members of the Rural Fire Service and Nepean Police Area Command for their recent responses and to all emergency services personal, who put their lives on the line and work tirelessly every day to protect us.
