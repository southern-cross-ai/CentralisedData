        As you would know, thoroughbred horseracing is alive and well in rural Australia, particularly in my electorate of Indi. I had the enormous pleasure on Saturday to go to the Alexandra Cup. It was a wonderful day with terrific crowds, great fields, excellent prizes, a fantastic atmosphere and such a warm welcome when I arrived from Barb Gamble, the treasurer; and Marg Tranter—thank you very much.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the highlights of the day was being able to congratulate Dr Doug Norman on his being awarded life membership. Doug is a traditional country vet, well loved by all—farmers, pet owners and the whole community. His two daughters, whom I was proud to meet, are both vets, and his son is an electrician.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only has he supported the racing club as a vet, he has also offered significant sponsorship to make the day such a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a wonderful day, and I am very, very pleased to be able to say thank you to the wonderful committee—and to the whole community that make it possible—particularly to

         Townsville celebrates 150 years of settlement next year. I want to speak about a man who has been at the forefront of our city's educational excellence for nearly a fifth of that time.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Livingston" rel="nofollow">
          John Livingston
         </a>
         has been principal at Kirwan State high school for nearly 30 years. In that time, he has seen the school develop from a tiny place on the edge of town to a massive corporate entity with a huge student base, international recognition for education, fantastic music and arts programs, and sporting excellence rivalled by few. More than that, John Livingston has loved his school, his students and the role of the educator in everyday of his professional life. Whether you were there 25 years ago, or whether you have graduated last year, he has touched your life with a love of learning, and has a capacity to inspire students, parents and citizens to want better for themselves and for each other. I count John as a friend and mentor. He is very sick at the moment and I want him to know that I love him as a mate. I want him to know that if none of my children attended his school, his mantra of doing better and giving opportunity—
