        People from country towns really understand the importance of an agricultural or community show to our regional communities. Country shows bring communities together. They play a vital role in our communities by showcasing local talent, providing a form of entertainment and offering goods and produce to buy.

        in particular also offer an opportunity to showcase new and innovative agricultural equipment, technology and local produce.

        Throughout this COVID year country shows have been on hold as our communities isolated themselves to reduce the risk of spread. As that risk decreases, I was pleased to see two communities in my electorate have opened their doors and gone full steam ahead with their country shows. The Kojonup Agricultural Show was held on 17th of this month and the 129th Katanning agricultural show was held last Saturday. While I couldn't get to them myself, due to being stuck here in Canberra, I had stalls at both shows, and my state government colleagues and candidates were there flying the flag. I'm told both these events were a resounding success and attended by people from all over

        , which is a testament to the importance of these beloved shows to their communities and the surrounding districts. Katanning Agricultural Society president Jill Kowald said that with the date set for 24 October, when restrictions were expect to ease, the society made the call to soldier on with strict hygiene and social distancing. I'm so proud that the people of my home town aren't hiding under the doona, and I'm grateful that my 94-year-old mum had a much-needed day out to meet up with her many, many friends.
