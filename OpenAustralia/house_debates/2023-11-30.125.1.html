        I recently had the pleasure of attending the annual open day of Remount, which is a not-for-profit organisation assisting those who have served to get 'back in the saddle' and reconnect through horsemanship. Located on a beautiful farm in Binalong, near Yass, they deliver horsemanship programs for current and former service men and women and their families, who may be experiencing stress,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        and/or physical injury related due to their service. Their experienced team takes participants through all aspects of horsemanship and mustering. Remount is delivered at absolutely no cost to current and former serving members of the military and has recently widened its remit to service first responders as well. The team of drovers and ringers who run the programs are all volunteers, generously giving their time, and they're putting on 10 circuit-breaking weekends this year. At the open day I was able to talk to participants, who told me that Remount had literally saved their lives. I'm thankful for what founders Ben and Marina Maguire have achieved with Remount, and I share their optimism and recognise them for the support they give to those who have served.

        I was absolutely thrilled to celebrate the opening of Gravity Eden, which took place on the weekend. This project has been in the works for many, many years, and it's one that I've been a big supporter of, from its conception to its reality. Gravity Eden is Eden's new mountain-bike park, consisting of more than 58 kilometres of mountain-bike trails and spanning a remarkable 300-metre elevation. The project came about thanks to the collaboration between the Eden Mountain Bike Club, Eden Community Access Centre, and Forestry Corporation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        , along with a $4.52 million co-contribution from the Australian and NSW governments under the Bushfire Local Economic Recovery program. Eden represents not only an exceptional mountain-biking destination but also a vibrant community. The multimillion-dollar project will deliver a critical contribution to our local community. I can't wait to get the kids down there. Well done to everyone involved.

        Recently we had the launch of the national circularity centre in Bega. Quite simply, circularity is how we use our scarce resources, with the aim of using them to their highest value in a more sustainable way going forward. The community in Bega, along with industry, agriculture and government, have joined to create a regionally based program to improve circularity. I was so proud to be there at the launch. It's a place where so many people have come together. The circular valley would not have happened without the

        The Albanese government are so committed to circularity that we have a one-billion-dollar investment to improve circularity in Australia.
