        [by video link] Our community is home to so many generous individuals who go above and beyond to help their neighbours and make our community a better place to live. Volunteers don't do what they do for accolades or acknowledgement. My annual Burt Volunteer Awards acknowledge their contribution and also encourage others to get involved. The winners of the volunteer awards are just the tip of the iceberg in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge that the winner of the 2021 Burt volunteer disability support category award was Rob Turner of the Kelmscott Bulldogs Football Club. Rob started the first inclusive sporting team in our community. This year the inaugural integrated all abilities
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        footy team has provided many local people living with disability the opportunity not only to play footy but also to get involved in the club in non-playing roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year there were three joint winners in the youth category, siblings Ashton, Destiny and Jasmine Perkins, who all balance generous community work with their studies at school and university.
       </p>
       <p>
        The winner of the environment category was Unice Robinson from Friends of Mary Carroll Wetland, who has been tirelessly working to activate the community and organising teams of volunteers to week, plant, pick up rubbish and run educational events.
       </p>
       <p>
        The winner in the sport category was Dawn Pereira from Gosnells City Football Club for her tireless work organising all sorts of functions and fundraisers for the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The winner of the community service category was Neville Raxworthy for his running of community youth service programs in Gosnells and the Gosnells District Neighbour Watch for many years, as well as being a justice of the peace and for contributing to education and safety.
