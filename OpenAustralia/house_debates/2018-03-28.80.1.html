       <p>
        For the 29th time since the resurrection of the Liberal saviour we see the sad procession of government MPs dragging themselves into question time, saying, 'We'll all be ruined.' They are as happy as a house full of Hanrahans. They don't need to wait for another opinion poll to tell them what the people of Australia have already worked out: they've run out of gas. They have got no ideas and no agenda, just a Prime Minister who waffles on and on and on and shows absolutely no judgement at all.

        Take yesterday for example. Just hours after it was revealed that four out of five
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        members would not pass on the $65 billion worth of handouts from this Prime Minister to workers in a pay rise or new jobs, the Prime Minister thought it would be a good idea to walk over there to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        and help the union for big business launch their 'big business is really nice' campaign. This is the campaign that is trying to convince Australians that $65 billion is better spent on handouts to big business than on hospitals for sick kids or schools or universities.
       </p>

        Yesterday, the member for Warringah said that leaders are often better the second time around. Well, not this Prime Ministerâ€”he's the same guy.
