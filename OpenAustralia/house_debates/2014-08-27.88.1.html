        My question is to the Minister for Health. I refer the minister to this article in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        on 29 July, referring to Australian taxpayers' funds being used to pay parking fines by Medicare Locals. Minister, what is the government doing to tidy up the waste that we inherited from the other side?

           The Health portfolio, I am sorry to say, was no exception by any stretch of the imagination. People who live in

            New South Wales

           or Queensland in particular know that Labor wreck the health system. They put money into bureaucracies—they take it away from patients and doctors and front-line services and they put it into health bureaucracies. That is what Labor do, and why do they do it? They do it because that is what pleases the union bosses. The union bosses are pleased with that sort of activity because it houses all sorts of former secretaries and workers within the union otherwise. That is why patients suffer.

              GP

             superclinics, and we know what has happened there: there are vacant paddocks across the country where people were supposed to be seeing GP superclinics. They have never been built. Do you know what happened when we came into government? We had a department and 23 outside agencies, presided over by Australia's worst health minister,

                In relation to Medicare Locals, they created a great, big, new health bureaucracy within Medicare Locals and they distracted money away from doctors and nurses that should have been spent on patients and they put it into these bureaucratic structures.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have said that we will cut from 61 the number of Medicare Locals down to a number less than 30, and we will get more money back to doctors and nurses so that patients can be seen, not just in primary-care settings but within public hospital settings as well. We are determined to make sure that we can reduce Labor's health bureaucracy, because they trash the health system at a state level. They trashed it at a federal level over the course of the last six years. And it is our job to clean up Labor's mess. We are getting more money to front-line services. Why? Because we have an ageing population and because we are determined to beef up the response at a primary-care level. We will clean up Labor's mess and we will make sure that more money gets back to the front-line health services in this country.
