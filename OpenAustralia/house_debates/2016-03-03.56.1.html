       <p>
        Today, I rise to acknowledge an incredible local public school in the Lindsay electorate—that is, Llandilo Public School, which is turning 150 this year. The member for Macquarie tells me that Llandilo Public School was once in her electorate. I am sure she is wishing them happy birthday this year as well. This is a wonderful school. Llandilo still has so much country charm. Principal Deborah Getley has said the school is becoming absorbed by some of the growth areas of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , being right next to Jordan Springs. So we will see a lot of changes happening to Llandilo over the next few years.
       </p>
       <p>
        A good friend of mine Charlie Oxenham, who is now 86, and Roxana Jensen, who is 93, recently went back to the school and reminisced about when the school was completely surrounded by cow paddocks and had dirt floors. The school is very different today than what it was a hundred years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, the school boasts a wonderful vegetable patch, a museum in a 1913 classroom and a wonderful continuity of family connections, such as through assistant principal Nicole Waugh—her grandmother Amy Luxford was a student, as was her father Noel Paul and now her son Riley. I wish the entire school community at Llandilo Public School a very happy birthday. You have a wonderfully rich history in the area. Congratulations.
