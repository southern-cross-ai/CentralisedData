        Today I want to congratulate Bundaberg's Lex Greensill, who was invested as a Commander of the

        last week for his services to the economy. He was named in the 2017

         His Royal Highness
        </a>
        the Prince of Wales. This is a story of successâ€”success which was earned. As someone who came from humble beginnings in my hometown of Bundaberg and who grew up on his parents' cane and sweet potato farm, he saw firsthand the impact of late payments on small business, when his father's sugar cane farm experienced the pressure of being a small company supplying large nationals. From those beginnings, ideas were built. In the following years, he successfully led the supply chain finance businesses for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Citi before he and a team of seasoned specialists founded Greensill Capital in 2011. He was appointed a senior adviser to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">

        Prime Minister, where he advised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
         White House
        </a>
        on the successful launch of their supply chain finance initiatives. He is also a senior adviser to Her Majesty's government on supply chain finance. He is also a graduate of the public high school Kepnock State High School in Bundaberg, which just happens to be where I graduated from. This man is a reflection of the motto of that high school, which says that success is earned. I congratulate the Greensill family wholeheartedly, and particularly Lex for his success; it's a unique honour. I say to all of those kids out there: this is what you can achieve if you work hard and give it your best effort.
