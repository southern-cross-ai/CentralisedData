        I start by welcoming to the chamber today Ambassador Culvahouse and the many others who have joined us today representing the United States. Today I rise to recognise the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's historic trip to the moon and to honour all who made it possible, including the many Australians who were part of that amazing achievement. Fifty years ago it was said that the heavens became part of man's world, and for one priceless moment all the people of this world were truly one. The achievement of that day lives through the ages. We should never cease to marvel at that achievement nor take it for granted, nor the nation that enabled us to achieve it.

        The decision to send a person to the moon ultimately involved the efforts and toil of 400,000 men and women for almost a decade. I'm sure many members and many outside of this place have taken the opportunity to watch many of the documentaries that have been airing and to marvel again at the tremendous stories. I took that opportunity with my kids over the weekend. These 400,000 men and women included 700 Australians. Every part of their effort was vital. Every challenge was interconnected with every other part of their mission. Nothing could be left undone, because the consequences of failure were too great. All who worked on the Apollo program carried the burden of Apollo 1, when astronauts

        wrote of the stations at Honeysuckle and Tidbinbilla, 'the road to the moon leads through Tharwa', and it did. The tracking stations formed part of the electromagnetic umbilical cord through which information travelled 186,000 miles per second. In the words of historian and author

        , Honeysuckle, Tidbinbilla and Parkes all played their part in a remarkable moment for humanity. It is a remarkable thing that we rarely say that Americans went to the moon, though that is a statement of obvious fact. Rather, to us it wasn't just Americans who went to the moon; it was humankind that went to the moon. That's because the United States, through its actions, embodied the best of us and all of us.

        said, 'The Apollo missions stand as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown.' They remind us that through united, concerted and unrelenting effort we can meet the challenges of our age: cancer, disease, water, climate, race—all things that challenge us.

         I join with the Prime Minister in commemorating the 50th anniversary of this quite remarkable event. The voyage to the moon, and that one small step, began with a visionary president dedicating himself and his nation to doing the hard things. John F. Kennedy of course didn't live to see this dream made real, but, knowing the United States as he did, he would have had every confidence that the hard things would indeed be done.

         did anything but choose the easy path. They let themselves be strapped into a tiny capsule on top of what, if all went according to plan, amounted to a prolonged explosion that would hurl them free of our planet's atmosphere and then its gravity. To say that this required courage is quite an understatement. The technology had advanced in the seven years since
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn" rel="nofollow">
          John Glenn
         </a>
         , the first American to orbit the earth, went to the launch pad with this thought:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I felt about as good as anybody would, sitting in a capsule on top of a rocket that were both built by the lowest bidder.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the risks were indeed huge. Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins knew them all, but off they went. They were proud Americans, carrying the stars and stripes to another world, but they went for all of humanity. They were the human race reaching out, the human race following our endless hunger to explore, to discover, to know.
        </p>
        <p>
         It seems somehow fitting that Armstrong and Aldrin landed the
         <i>
          Eagle
         </i>
         with only 30 seconds of fuel to spare. To think how disconcerting it feels when the fuel warning light comes on in your car when you're still on the highway might give you some perspective on that! Eventually, Armstrong's words came back across the void:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those words and that footage first touched down in Australia, landing on a dish at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeysuckle_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Honeysuckle Creek
         </a>
         , just up the road from here. Tidbinbilla and Parkes played crucial roles as well. Here on the opposite side of the world to Houston, Australia was perfectly placed to be the eyes and ears for America and ultimately the world. Australia certainly played our part, and we are proud of it—and rightly so. I note that the Deputy Prime Minister is particularly proud of the role his electorate played, as he should be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Right across Australia that day 50 years ago, people crowded around black-and-white televisions in living rooms, schools and shops. I remember—it's probably my first memory of watching anything on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         —being with the nuns at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
          St Joseph's
         </a>
         , Camperdown. Obviously we didn't have a TV in the school. We were in the nunnery, next to the school, watching it play out live. As a nation, we held our breath—first as they landed and then as we wondered whether they'd successfully take off and get home. As Armstrong uttered one of the most famous sentences in history, one person who did not hear it was Collins. While planet earth heard about that giant leap, Collins was alone in the orbiter, passing through the shadow on the far side of the moon, cut off from all communications, drinking coffee, in the most perfect peace.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Collins self-caffeinated among the stars and Armstrong and Aldrin lay their boots on untrodden dust, they knew they'd been put there by the work of 400,000 people: engineers, scientists, mathematicians, doctors, cooks, cleaners, builders—you name it—brought together by a government of courage and vision and a nation united in the fulfilment of a vision, the realisation of a dream they'd all come to share. Up there, surrounded by what Aldrin later described as 'magnificent desolation', they all lifted their gaze above the eerily small lunar horizon and looked back at what mattered most—planet earth, a blaze of colour in the black sky, beautiful, fragile and the heart of all we are. Fifty years ago, three of America's finest made that planet feel bigger for all of us. It was a time of wonder and excitement. What had once seemed impossible had been achieved. The last word should go to the first man. Many years later, Neil Armstrong reviewed the moon as a destination and he said this: 'It's an interesting place to be. I recommend it.'
