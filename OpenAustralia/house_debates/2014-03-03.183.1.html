       <p>
        On Saturday I was privileged to attend a welcome home parade in Darwin for Australian troops: men and women who had been deployed and served in Afghanistan across 2013. More than 250 ADF personnel, predominantly members of the Army, took part in the parade, which formally recognised the service and achievements of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Task Group, Combined Team Uruzgan 4 and Combined Team Uruzgan 5â€”all of whom were deployed in Afghanistan across 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parade was led by members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Engineers" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Engineers
        </a>
        with explosive detection dog Domino, who re-enacted a route clearance mission. As we all know, this is a vital task in ensuring the safety and security of Australian soldiers during their operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The engineers were followed by members of Combined Team Uruzgan rotations 4 and 5, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Task Group, Force Support Unit 7, the Logistics Training Advisory Team, Artillery Training Advisory Team 2 and Armoured Core Support Elements and Force Communication Units rotations 8 and 9. They all proudly marched through the CBD of Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        They were there acknowledged and welcomed by the Prime Minister, the Hon.
