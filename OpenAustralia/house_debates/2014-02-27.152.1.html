       <p>
        We all love our country. Indeed, Australia is truly blessed to have places of great beauty. In fact, my electorate of Lyons is home to many of the most iconic natural attractions in this country, which bring visitors from around the world to experience same.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the electorate of Lyons we have the majestic

        , the second oldest national park in Australia. We have the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Island" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the beautiful surrounding east coast beaches. The historic

         Port Arthur
        </a>
        penitentiary site, one of Tasmania's most visited attractions, is also in my patch.
       </p>
       <p>
        The latest Tasmanian tourism figures tell us that the state had more than one million visitors in the past 12 months, who spent in our state more than $1.5 billion. That was an 11 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. The visitor numbers were also up on the previous year by 18 per cent. The total number of visitors holidaying in Tasmania in the last 12 months was 410,300 compared to 349,000 the previous year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism is an important and growing industry for my state, which is struggling, as you well know, Deputy Speaker, financially. In my electorate of Lyons, 2,892 people or 7.1 per cent of the workforce are employed in tourism. We have 1,132 tourism related businesses, which represents 13.7 per cent of all businesses, according to the latest data from the
        <i>
         National Tourism Business Count and Employment Atlas
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Cafe and restaurant jobs account for the largest proportion of tourism jobs—24 per cent in the electorate—followed by jobs in accommodation, 20 per cent; and in the retail sector, a little less at 17 per cent. Tourism is a critical economic driver across Australia, generating $95 billion of expenditure and directly employing 514,000 people and supporting 283,000 businesses. It is no less important in Tasmania and in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        As deputy chairman of the coalition backbench committee on tourism I know the value of the industry to my state as it struggles to work through the tough economic times it is being dealt by the collapse of the forestry industry and the poor economic management of my state by consecutive Labor governments over 16 years. I am determined to do what I can to help rebuild Tasmania as a vibrant and self-sufficient economy. Tourism will be an important part of that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note the comments today in one of the major newspapers in my state by the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania that suggests that, going into the 15 March election, neither major party has a plan, particularly in relation to the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
          Spirit of Tasmania
         </a>
        </i>
        . I dispute this very strongly, because, certainly from the federal government's point of view, we are working through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        and the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I just note, that in terms of the mechanics of getting across the highway, that the vessel is owned entirely by the state government. One wonders, given that people come from both directions, whether there is a case for Victoria—the other beneficiary of that highway—contributing to that vessel.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a plan. Tasmanian Liberals have a plan to support tourism generally. I support that plan. It will help the industry grow and contribute to the state's economic development.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hodgman" rel="nofollow">
         Will Hodgman
        </a>
        will be the minister for tourism, we hope, after 15 March. The policy includes a plan to open up our national parks and world heritage areas to tourists by calling for expressions of interest from private investors and tourism operators. No better example could be given than in the Cradle Mountain hut experience and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Currant" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Currant
        </a>
        and the Pumphouse Point development. Proponents would have to propose sensible, low-impact ecotourism experiences and infrastructure. This would broaden the range of unique experiences on offer in Tasmania's national parks. Cradle Mountain is a great example of how sensitive development can be done. Appropriate development around state parks and reserves would encourage and drive visitation, and unlock the potential of the parks to the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I compliment Tourism Tasmania for the work that they have done in the past 12 months with their Go behind the Scenery campaign and the good work being done by the regional tourism organisations. I seek leave to table 'Liberal plan to create new tourism jobs by unlocking our parks and

         Many years ago—it may even have been before my incarnation as an MP—I sat down with my old sparring partner
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hewitt" rel="nofollow">
          Andrew Hewitt
         </a>
         , a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Communist Party
         </a>
         organiser in student politics, who was then the executive director of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Aid_Abroad" rel="nofollow">
          Community Aid Abroad
         </a>
         , which later begat Oxfam. We reached a modus vivendi not to descend back into the days of student politics and have endless fights about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . It was a very wise policy for me and for Oxfam—we could both proceed with out lives. Unfortunately, under pressure from the mother country it seems that people in London whose decrees do not jive with the new world seem to have given the impression that Oxfam internationally is very closely associated with the boycott of Israel movement. That is very unfortunate, because Oxfam does excellent international humanitarian work and human rights work. I am sure that it does not fit with the Australian mentality. That is why a number of Labor MPs this week made it very clear that we are opposed to the boycott of Israel, just as when the previous government was in office then foreign minister Rudd, Treasurer Swan et cetera joined me, people from the current government and other people from public life at various
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Brenner" rel="nofollow">
          Max Brenner
         </a>
         outlets to show our opposition to this selective boycott.
        </p>
        <p>
         The current focus of the concerns of this selective boycott movement is a company called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SodaStream" rel="nofollow">
          SodaStream
         </a>
         , which has one of its 18 factories in a place called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'ale_Adumim" rel="nofollow">
          Ma'ale Adumim
         </a>
         . The factory employs mainly Palestinian workers who, I understand, are paid exactly the same wages. Ahmed Nasser, who works in the factory, when he was meeting a delegation from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church" rel="nofollow">
          Presbyterian Church
         </a>
         said, 'They're the best conditions in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          West Bank
         </a>
         . Everything is according to the law.' He added that he receives an hour-and-a-half worth of breaks in a standard 12-hour shift and that prayer times are not deducted from break allowances. Perhaps we could institute some of these ideas in the Australian industrial relations system!
        </p>
        <p>
         Anyone who supports this boycott, especially those who pretend to be left wingers, has to look into the eyes of those who survived the Hitler regime and their descendants when discussing boycotts of Israeli or Jewish businesses. Some years ago I received a glossy booklet from this boycott group that advocated boycotting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Oreal" rel="nofollow">
          L'Oreal
         </a>
         , Revlon and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidal_Sassoon" rel="nofollow">
          Vidal Sassoon
         </a>
         , none of which companies are based in the Middle East. They are all famous international cosmetic companies whose only commonality was that their owners were Jewish. It is clear that the motives of the boycott movement are not to promote peace, they are not to promote the current negotiations that are being fostered by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Barack_Obama" rel="nofollow">
          President Barack Obama
         </a>
         , they are not to promote a peaceful solution for the Palestinian people; the boycott is a vehicle for hardliners seeking to cloak their unacceptable political ends in the rhetoric of human rights.
        </p>
        <p>
         Do not take my word for this. On 14 December last year, in the

         the guru and founder of this international boycott campaign said, 'Going back to a two-state solution, beside having passed its expiry date, it was never a moral solution to start with.' In the same article, he said, 'Good riddance. The two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is finally dead. But someone has to issue an official death certificate before the rotting corpse is given a proper burial and we can move onto a unitary state where, by definition, Jews will be a minority.'

         If you were in Israel—a highly successful, high-tech, pluralist, democratic state where there are Arab members of the Knesset and of the supreme court and so on—and viewing events in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt, you would not easily be giving up the pluralist, democratic, technocratic state you live in for of the aims of very hard-line people.
