        When I recently posted on Facebook my support for penalty rates and the important role that they play not only in the livelihood of young people in my electorate but also the regional economy of towns like Newcastle, I was overwhelmed by the level of support from Novocastrians and, indeed, the broader community. Their reasons for supporting penalty rates were broad, but I want to highlight just two of the stories that were shared with me on Facebook. There is a single mum and she is a cleaner at a major hospital in Newcastle. She said:
