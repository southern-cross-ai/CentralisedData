        On Friday night, I had the great honour to go to the Warrnambool Racing Club to launch the May Racing Carnival which will take place this year. That's three fantastic days of flat racing and jumps racing. I say to everyone: get along if you possibly can, because it will be great entertainment as always. There were also the inductees into the Warrnambool Racing Club Hall of Fame. I commend

        , the committee chair of the Warrnambool Racing Club, and all the committee for this great, great initiative. Eight inaugural members were inducted last year, and another four were added this year: the great jumper Al Garhood; Ted Byrne, a legendary jockey;

        , a legendary chairman; and Bill Gibbins. It was Bill Gibbins who had the foresight and the initiative to put in place the Jericho Cup. It is now another great feature of the Warrnambool Racing Club, and it goes from strength to strength. Bill, your health isn't great at the moment, but hopefully being inducted to the Warrnambool Racing Club Hall of Fame will improve your spirits and make sure you have a speedy recovery. We all wish you the very best.

        On Saturday night, I was pleased to be able to go to the Warrnambool Golf Club, where they unofficially opened their wonderful new $7 million clubhouse. It is a fantastic facility. It will be there for many, many years to come so that people can have a quiet beer after playing golf. People will be able to go there and have 21sts. They will be able to get married there. It's got a beautiful vista. There are 12 to 14 holes at the golf course. It's just a wonderful venue now. I say to Paul Blain, the chairman of the goal club, well done for having the courage to say: 'We're going to do this. We're going to get on and do it.' Now there is a wonderful legacy as a result of your inspiring leadership. Also, Ashlee Scott, who oversaw the whole project, did a wonderful job in making sure that it was been done in a way that, when you go there, you just know that it is a quality place to have a drink after golf, have a function or have a celebration. The community is all the richer and all the better for the great work that Paul, Ashlee and the whole of the golf club have done in putting this new facility in place for the local Warrnambool community.
