        My electorate has 44 schools, and one of the first things I did as a member was to launch an award called the Menzies Shield, which is an award for citizenship, leadership or another category that the school picks. The other benefit of visiting those schools in the assemblies is that I have often been invited to speak to children, particularly in primary schools but also in some secondary schools. Recently I've spoken to children at

        There's no greater privilege than standing in front of a whole assembly of students. When they get asked to put their hands up, it's what I imagine the full press gallery would be like if they were all together, except I think the students' questions are better. They're unfiltered and they're straight from their hearts about what they think is important. Some of them are like this: 'What made you want to become a member of parliament?' The answer I give is that it's a great honour to serve. I wasn't born here, and I always look for opportunities to give back. I think serving in this place is one of the greatest honours we all can have. They also ask questions like, 'How much do you get paid?' The answer is: enough. We get paid more than most Australians, to the point where we don't worry as much as others do.

         The gallery is complaining! They ask, 'How often do you speak to the Prime Minister?' I said I have spoken to him three times in the most unusual circumstances, in the parliament; I've asked him three questions, although yesterday I did bump into him in the corridor and got a nod. Maybe I will speak to him in person one day.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some ask what I did before politics. They ask questions like, 'What was war like?' I tell them truthfully there were some awful days, but there were many more that I remember fondly, especially the people I got to serve with and the chance to lead young, brave Australians. That was one of the greatest honours of my life. They ask about my time at

         </a>
         . They say: 'Did you get to make what you like? Is soft serve really made of ice cream?' I won't give away those secrets, but I think it's an important question.
        </p>
        <p>
         They ask if I have kids and whether I miss them. Yes, I do, and I do miss them. But they know that my coming here is a great honour for our family and for our country. They say, 'What do you enjoy most about being a member of parliament?' It's the chance to serve and to make a difference. It's also the citizenship ceremonies where you see people come to this country, so excited about the opportunities that are before them. Finally I say that I love being here. I love being here and speaking to you and answering your questions. Thank you.
