        might be over, but we're only halfway; we've got the Paralympics coming up. Like every member of this place, I had a number of participants in the Olympics, and I do want to give them a shout-out, because they performed exceptionally well, coming from regional Queensland and going all the way to Paris.
       </p>

        Tarin Gollshewsky is a teacher in Bundaberg, would you believe? She made her Olympic debut in the discus. She went in ranked 30th. She finished in 15th place and threw a personal best of 62.36 metres. I'm sure Ms Gollshewsky will be warmly welcomed back by her students and pupils. They'll be very excited to hear all about the Olympics.

        , finished seventh. That is Australia's best men's result in the Olympics in two decades. He is a machine. He was part of the mixed relay, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        finished in 12th place. Of course, we all saw the footage of the swimming in the Seine, so he should get an award for bravery as well!
       </p>
       <p>
        In swimming, Isaac Cooper from Bundaberg swam in the 100-metre backstroke. He was part of the 4 x 100-metre medley relay team, which placed sixth in the final. He is an incredible athlete. He works really hard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebecca Greiner from Bundaberg, a member of the Hockeyroos, made her Olympic debut as well. The Hockeyroos were unbeaten in pool B but, unfortunately, went down to China in the quarterfinals.
       </p>

        Shannon Davey is the boy from Narrabri, but he moved to Bundaberg to train with

        , so we're claiming him. He's with us. He's in the green-and-gold tracksuit, so he's definitely one of ours in Australia. He trains at the Attila Boxing Academy.

        from Bundy is in the 100-metre T34 and the 800-metre T34. This will be his fourth Paralympics. He won silver in Tokyo, he won silver in Rio, he won silver in London, and I know he's going to go all-out to get one more at the Paralympics in Paris.

        , the Bundaberg discus thrower in the F38, competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, where she finished sixth. She came into my office just in the last couple of weeks. She's a lovely young lady. I think my staff were more excited to meet her than anyone else. She was very much welcomed. She is just a ball of fun.

        In the last few seconds I've got, I thank one of my staff: Liz Carson. Liz has put in her notice after nine years of service to my office as a media adviser. Everyone in this place knows it's the media adviser that gets the 4 am call to see if the boss can be on at five. They also get the late-night call to show up to run the live view for Sky. Liz has been a wonderful part of my office, and she leaves with our gratitude and my gratitude. I wish her and the girls the best of luck in her new ventures. Hopefully, we'll still see you out on the polling booth, Liz; we'll be looking forward to some more help! Good luck with the new adventure, and thank you so much for your service. You've been a wonderful part of the team.
