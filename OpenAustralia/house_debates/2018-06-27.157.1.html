        Nearly 400 volunteer lifesavers from the 15 clubs across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        got together recently to celebrate another successful season at the Surf Life Saving Central Coast Awards of Excellence night. This season saw 513 lives saved, 17,970 preventive actions and 1,775 first aid cases, all by local volunteer surf lifesavers, over 96,300 patrol hours, so there was plenty to celebrate. With more than 8,000 volunteer members, our surf clubs do a fantastic job in helping to keep our beaches safe. I'd like to thank every member of a local surf lifesaving club for volunteering their time for the benefit of our community.

        I'd like to acknowledge some particularly exceptional volunteers from my electorate of Robertson. Open Athlete of the Year and Young Athlete of the Year was Jemma Smith from Umina Surf Life Saving Club.

Assessor of the Year was Ashley Capps from Copacabana Surf Life Saving Club, and Facilitator of the Year was Ramzy Fawzy from Wamberal Surf Life Saving Club.

        My own club, Terrigal Surf Life Saving Club, won a number of awards, and I was really proud to see the club named Overall Surf Sports Pointscore winners. Paul Lemmon won Masters Athlete of the Year, Tim Pittolo was awarded Trainer of the Year and the outstanding Cathy Cole was named

        Umina Surf Life Saving Club had an incredibly successful season and was recognised for this on the night, taking out the top honour of Club of the Year. MacMasters Beach Surf Life Saving Club and Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club won second and third, respectively, which was an outstanding achievement. To everyone at Umina: congratulations. To President Bill Cook and the whole team, thank you for all you do for our community. Club of the Year wasn't the only award Umina took home.
