       <p>
        We're calling on the federal government to support—I say the word 'support'—the thousands of women who are experiencing violence. We call on the federal government to immediately introduce legislation which will see the inclusion of 10 days paid domestic violence leave in the national employment standards. What I said is 'support'—not a bunch of those opposite wearing ribbons and painting their nails, showing support but not using their position of power in this place to do something about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Family and domestic violence, as we are all very, very well aware, is the leading cause of death, disability and illness among women in the 15 to 44 age group. It is greater than cancer or heart disease. Yet access to paid domestic violence leave is limited. Paid family violence leave means a woman can access support services so she can leave. It means she can attend court or doctors' appointments, or meet with real estate agents and find secure housing for herself and her children, without the fear of losing her job. Paid domestic violence leave will save lives. The estimated cost of introducing this is just 5c per day per worker—5c! The estimated cost of the family and domestic violence that is currently hitting our communities and streets is $12.6 billion per year.

        We won't wait. I was happy to meet with the campaigners of the We Won't Wait campaign today. We all know the statistics. We know that the outcome for some of those victims is death. The case has been made. We won't wait. I am very proud to support the We Won't Wait campaign.
