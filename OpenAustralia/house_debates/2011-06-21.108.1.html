        It was a great pleasure on seeing the Queen's birthday honours list to observe that there were eight constituents from Bradfield named in that list. I want to use this occasion to briefly pay tribute to them. First of all I would like to acknowledge Mr Douglas Spencer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for service to the community through a range of social welfare and service organisations and to the law. I would like to acknowledge Ms Helen Preston OAM of Wahroonga for service to conservation and the environment. I would like to acknowledge Mr Andrew Locke OAM of Gordon for his services to mountaineering. I would like to acknowledge Mr Ian De Mellow OAM of Wahroonga for service to aged welfare. I would like to acknowledge Mrs Margaret Catterall OAM of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Turramurra" rel="nofollow">
         North Turramurra
        </a>
        for services to the community through a range of Jewish organisations and to the Gemmological Association of Australia. I note in passing, with some pride, that my wife is a member of the Gemmological Association of Australia. I would like to pay tribute to Mr David Barnsdall OAM of Killara for services to the community through the Hamlin Fistula Australia organisation. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Geoffrey Ainsworth AM of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Ives" rel="nofollow">
         St Ives
        </a>
        . He was made a member of the Order of Australia for service to the visual and performing arts through the promotion and support of contemporary art and to the community. I would also like to acknowledge Mr Mark Scott AO, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Managing Director
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Broadcasting Corporation
        </a>
        and a constituent of mine in the suburb of Roseville. His citation reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For distinguished service to media and communications, and to the community through advisory and governance roles with a range of social justice and educational bodies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do note with pride the fact that all of these constituents were honoured in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours_List" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours List
        </a>
        . I particularly note the rich diversity of the nature of the service that they have provided to our community. One of the great features of the honours system in Australia is that it offers a chance for the community to note the contribution of people in so many diverse areas. As I move around the electorate of Bradfield, I am constantly struck at the range and diversity of people and of their voluntary or other contributions to the community. I think that the presence of eight constituents in the Queen's Birthday Honours List is testament to the degree of community services going on.
