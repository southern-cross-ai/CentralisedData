        The greatest initiatives that move us forward as a nation are never created by governments.

        , it's entrepreneurial work that's quietly happening each day which will shape the future of our country in extraordinary ways. Our job is to make sure the opportunities exist to allow people to create, to solve problems and to make creative proposals to help us move forward as a nation.

        Some people who are doing this work include Dr Vijay Paul from my electorate and Dr Nishanth Krishnananthan, the founders of Vantari

        . This company has developed technology to convert medical images from 2D into virtual reality so patients can see and more clearly and meaningfully understand what is happening to their bodies. They have now turned their attention to improving medical training. They saw the opportunity that virtual reality provides to have doctors deepen their knowledge and skills. Vantari VR are developing a sophisticated, realistic virtual cadaver which will give doctors more time and tools for deepening their skills, ultimately meaning an improvement in patient outcomes. I'm so proud to be able to say that the Morrison government has given them an opportunity to take their great work forward. Vantari VR have been named as a recipient of an Accelerating Commercialisation grant through Minister Andrews's Entrepreneurs' Program. The grant will allow them to complete the development of their new technology and get it ready for widespread use. I want to commend the Vantari team for the fantastic work they're doing. It's a privilege to be part of a government that's encouraging entrepreneurship and encouraging a company that pioneers and takes forward advances in medical training.
