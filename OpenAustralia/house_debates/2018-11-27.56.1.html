        My question is to the Prime Minister. The former Liberal, and now independent, member for Chisholm said that the policies of this government have changed:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … largely due to the actions of the reactionary and regressive right wing who talk about and to themselves rather than listening to the people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister, when will this chaotic and divided Liberal government stop fighting itself and start listening to the Australian people, who are saying that everything is going up except their wages?

        <p>
         I'm asked about the government's policies. I understand that's what the question was about: the government's policies. Our government's policies are for a stronger economy. Our government's policy is for tax relief to encourage and reward hardworking Australians. It is our government that delivered the personal income tax cuts, which will change the future of our tax system over the next decade. If you're a young person in your early 20s going to work today, the changes that we have legislated to our tax system means that bracket creep will not be a thing that you face over the course of your working life—for some 94 per cent of Australians. If you are a young person or a middle-aged person—or whatever stage of life you're in; you may be going into retirement—and you start a small business, as a small business owner you are going to pay only 25 per cent in tax, because that's what we've done as a government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our policy is to reduce the tax burden on Australians, to grow the economy. It's our government's policy to back small and family businesses, whether it's ensuring they get access to the finance or the capital or to ensure that we're reducing their red tape burden by removing and lifting the threshold for compliance burdens with ASIC for small business. Whether it's ensuring that they get paid on time, that governments pay them on time—the federal government, state governments—and that small businesses are not used as a bank, our policy is to fix the budget and that's exactly what we're doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before the Australian people go to the next election they will have a surplus budget delivered by a coalition budget. We said we'd fix the budget. It's taken us five budgets to get there, but the heavy lifting had to be done. We have done that by keeping expenditure under control, by keeping taxes under control and by growing the economy, which ensures that we can invest, importantly, in the funding for schools, hospitals and essential services—an extra $37 billion in funding for schools over the next decade and another $30 billion in the next five years for hospitals. Our policies are delivering this, because we're focusing on delivering a stronger economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our other policies are about keeping Australians safe. Last week I announced that we'll be introducing the legislation into this place this week to ensure that if there is a radical Islamic terrorist, or any terrorist of that nature, who we believe has another citizenship we will strip their citizenship away from them. You would never have got those policies from the Labor Party, because the Labor Party subcontracts out national security policy to the coalition on every single occasion. They might happily on occasion follow us. But when it comes to keeping Australians safe Labor is never in the lead. They are always trailing along behind, often making excuses but sometimes turning up to the event to ensure that we can keep Australians safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         We'll also be putting in place the exclusion orders. They're our policies—
