        I rise to say a few words about the fact that it is National Homelessness Week. It's an opportunity for all of us to recognise the growing crisis that we have not just in our electorates but also across Australia of far too many Australians finding themselves homeless. It is quite extreme what some people are having to go through. Just this week I've had people contact me and my office to share their experiences. A young family that have two children not too much younger than my own, a six-month-old and a two-year-old, are homeless, living with friends, hoping desperately to get a rental. They've applied for over 100 properties and are yet to be successful. This is one of many stories that all of us are hearing far too often. It is to be rare, but these days it's happening more and more.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a challenge that is complex because the solution is not a simple one. We need to increase the amount of social and community housing that we have, and our government has committed to do so. We have committed to building more housing stock. We need to work with developers and to work on possible schemes where we are looking at a proportion of a development that goes towards low-cost or social and community housing, schemes that have been successful at state government levels. We need to work with local governments who are willing to put forward their own ideas. I have an amazing commitment from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Alexander_Shire" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in my electorate, who want to put forward the possibility of their old car park being turned into accommodationâ€”being able to build small, independent units on that block. They're just hoping that they can pull the state government, the federal government, a developer and a community not-for-profit all together to help make it happen. It's innovative thinking, but the way in which to make that project happen feels really complex. So we do need to get together at the local, state and federal level with community and industry on how we can get more housing stock built.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also need to look at areas like Airbnb and the impact that that has had. Whilst it might be great for people to have more affordable or have a homelike experience on their holidays, it has had an impact on our rental market. How much of an impact is something that I believe we need to investigate. These are issues that I'm raising and that lots of people are raising during National Homelessness Week. The last thing I'll say is that we need to act urgently. Far too many people tonight and this week are homeless. Whether they're couch surfing, staying with friends and family or living rough, more people need a place to call home.
