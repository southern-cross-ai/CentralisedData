       <p>
        On 2 August I had the great honour of hosting a community morning tea with the Prime Minister, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        . The event was a great success, and over 400 local community members gathered at the Gateway Baptist Church in Mackenzie to meet and mingle with the Prime Minister. Representatives from a wide range of community organisations and schools throughout the electorate of Bonner were present, and I take this opportunity to commend each and every guest for helping to make the morning tea such a memorable occasion. I also thank the Prime Minister on yet another display of his commitment to the people of Bonner and those in the community who work so tirelessly to make our local area an even better place to live. I can assure the Prime Minister that he will always be welcome in Bonner, and I know that for many at the morning tea the opportunity to personally meet their Prime Minister was a great honour and an enjoyable experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was with particular interest that I read a local school newsletter after the event in which a year 7 student,

        in Manly, reflected on his experience when he wrote:

        I went to see Mr John Howard on Wednesday at a morning tea. It was a cool experience. He did a speech about all the stuff that is going on and there were a lot of people there. The morning tea was great, I loved it! The Prime Minister is a nice guy and we took photos with him. We all sang

        and we all talked a lot, we loved it. And I felt very special.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe Danny Kelly captured the sentiments of all students when he wrote those words, and I am delighted that the event proved such a special experience not only for school representatives but for community members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, I acknowledge that the event would not have been made possible without the dedicated efforts of the staff and volunteers of the Gateway Baptist Church. Pastor

        led a team of fine men and women who worked extremely hard to facilitate an outstanding morning tea, and I congratulate the church again. It is through interaction with the grassroots community that all government leaders gain a better understanding of and respect for those local Australians who contribute so significantly, yet often so quietly, to the community. I remain committed to bringing the leaders here in Canberra to Bonner so they can personally see the good work of the community that is alive in the electorate.
