        I'm so proud of how the Perth community and the Perth electorate have responded during this pandemic crisis. Our community has, I believe, the highest number per capita of rainbows and teddy bears in windows of any electorate in the country. The Forsyth Gardens retirement village residents gained social media fame with their socially distant street party. We've seen many small businesses innovate. Childcare centres have been struggling through change after change after change. Whipper Snapper Distillery made 13,000 litres of sanitiser out of 130,000 litres of wine. Some would say that's a waste; I think it's a great achievement. Beaufort Street Books had international authors join them on Zoom. Future Bayswater have the farmers market. The

        As I said in this parliament in March, we need and want the Prime Minister and the government to do well. Equally, I'm proud of how the opposition leader and our side have conducted themselves during this time. But doing well means doing something about jobseeker; doing well means doing something about JobKeeper. That will provide certainty for small businesses, vulnerable communities and our education sector.
