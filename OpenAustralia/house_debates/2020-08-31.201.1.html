       <p>
        While it has been a challenging period, many school communities in my electorate have experienced major milestones this year, which I would like to acknowledge.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosebank_College" rel="nofollow">
         Rosebank College
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Dock" rel="nofollow">
         Five Dock
        </a>
        is farewelling their principal, Mr Tom Galea, who, after 16 years of service to the school, has announced his retirement. As a former Rosebank College student, I can attest to the fact that Mr Galea has transformed the school in his time as principal. I wish him all the best for the future, knowing the school will uphold the legacy he is leaving behind. I would like to congratulate Mrs Helen Elliott, Principal of All Hallows Catholic Primary School in Five Dock, who is a finalist in the Australian Education Awards. She has been nominated in the category Primary School Principal of the Year for a non-government school. I wish her all the very best for this exciting ceremony.

        Over in Strathfield,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Sabina_College" rel="nofollow">
         Santa Sabina College
        </a>
        will soon have significant safety upgrades as a result of the Morrison government's Safer Communities Fund. Congratulations to their principal, Ms Paulina Skerman, on successfully gaining a federal grant of $345,000 for new security fencing and gates as well as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Likewise, I would like to acknowledge St Mary's Catholic Primary School in Concord, which has received $18,000 through the Morrison government's Local Schools Community Fund for a new shade structure. It was a pleasure to meet the principal, Anna Marsella, who introduced me to the kindy students, who are enjoying the new shade sail.
