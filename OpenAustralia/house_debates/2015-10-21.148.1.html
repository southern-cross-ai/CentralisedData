        Wednesday, 7 October saw the small business awards in the Panthers marquee in Penrith. It was a wonderful event, and it is also wonderful to support local small business. Two-thirds of the community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        have to commute every single day for work, one-third to the city and one-third into other places around greater Western Sydney. The Penrith region has in the vicinity of 10,000 small businesses. These 10,000 businesses are essential so that more people can work, live and play close to home.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to now go through a few of the winners at that wonderful event. The youth award went to

        These are wonderful local businesses, wonderful local entrepreneurs, who have been working very hard to keep local people working. The other night I was sitting with the wonderful Gina Field, who is not only an incredible entrepreneur herself from Nepean Regional Security but also the president of the Penrith Valley Chamber of Commerce. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been involved in the local business for many years. The local business awards give small business a platform to not only build up the business but to inspire and motivate their employees as well. As the president of the Penrith Valley Chamber of Commerce and a small business owner myself, I know that owning a small business can be a lonely place at times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Winning an award and awards programs give small business self-acknowledgement and the encouragement to continue to do what they do best and continue to grow and employ. I congratulate all of the businesses and hope that they have a very good year this year and that, as we run into Christmas, they are all getting ready and they have all their stock on their shelves.
