        One of the great privileges we all share in this vocation is participating in awards and graduation ceremonies for schools in our electorates. As all members would agree, seeing students flourish is something that keeps us going. It's great to be in touch with young Australians who are learning and growing as they finish school.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it's not just that academic success that we celebrate. In 2020, I introduced, for schools in my electorate, an award for outstanding students called the Double Reds Resilience Award. This award is for those who embody the spirit of determination and resilience of the brave soldiers of the 2nd Independent Company, who faced overwhelming odds during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . The name Double Reds derives its significance from the Double Reds' insignia, proudly worn by the members of the company.
       </p>
       <p>
        To fully appreciate this award, we must briefly examine the remarkable history of these men, who are often hailed as Australia's first commandos. In 1942, these extraordinary soldiers, known as the 2/2, embarked on a significant guerrilla campaign in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        after the Japanese invasion in February of that year. The campaign lasted for almost a year, with the 2/2 faced overwhelming Japanese forces as they were cut off from the rest of Australia with no communications back to the mainland. Although East Timor wasn't the main theatre of the Pacific war, the 2/2 actions in 1942 played a pivotal role in securing victory for the allied forces. These brave soldiers, with the support of the Timorese people, held their ground and resisted the Japanese forces under incredibly challenging circumstances. Their efforts diverted thousands of Japanese troops that would otherwise have been deployed to critical battlefields, like Kokoda and Guadalcanal. I think that the 2/2's bravery in tough times altered the path of our national history. It's worth noting—this might be slightly parochial—that more than 80 per cent of the original 2/2 soldiers hailed from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , making this story especially meaningful for my local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        About the award itself, it's something very special we have created, along with the 2/2 families, to honour the legacy of the 2/2 and share their noble and inspiring story with young Australians. The award's primary objective is to recognise students who have shown exceptional character and resilience in the face of adversity and hardship throughout the school year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Double Reds Resilience Award is a symbol of inspiration for our youth. It encourages them to face challenges with strength, bravery and determination and to never give up. It celebrates the qualities of character and resilience that are essential not only during one's school years but also throughout one's life. We all know that adversity is an inevitable part of our lives; it's part of the human experience. We are striving to instil in our young people the same kind of resilience and determination that the 2/2 displayed during their service and to honour those young Australians who have faced adversity already in their lives, whether it be through grief and loss, through disability or through illness—

        As I was saying, this award, the Double Reds Resilience Award, is not about academic excellence. It's about publicly acknowledging and honouring young Australians who have overcome personal obstacles, helped others in times of need or demonstrated exceptional strength of character. Over the last three years, I've met a lot of young Australians in Canning who've suffered grief and loss, who've struggled with a disability or an illness, yet they have persevered. It's been such a privilege to honour them in their local school community. That's why we have the award, and we want those students to learn from the valour of the 2/2 and inspire them to be future leaders who can make a positive impact on their community. I look forward to handing more of these out at the end of the year, and I thank you for extending the time so I could finish my speech.
