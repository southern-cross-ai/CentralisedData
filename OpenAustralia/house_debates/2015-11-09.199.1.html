        It is always a pleasure to stand in this place and recognise some of the wonderful achievements of the young people in our communities. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate four year 10 students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_College" rel="nofollow">
         Canterbury College
        </a>
        who took part in the Junior Secondary Schools Culinary Challenge at Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        . In teams of two students Jessica Lord, Alexander Noney, Kaitlyn Randle and Taneisha Richardson competed against 17 other teams from around Queensland. The students had to work with a chef to present a meal in 90 minutes. They also had to work out costings and ingredient constraints, and they had to incorporate at least two Indigenous ingredients. The students also had to demonstrate certain skills, including turning vegetables and deboning chicken. The competition was highly competitive and the meals were outstanding, but in the end the panel of six judges declared the team of Jessica Lord and Alexander Noney the victors, winning first place in the state. Kaitlyn Randle and Taneisha Richardson also did very well, placing third overall. Jessica, Alexander, Kaitlyn and Taneisha worked very hard over the past couple of months, practising their dish after school so that they could take part in the state finals. This is a fantastic result for the school. I would also like to mention chef mentor Adam Gleaves and their teacher Mrs Ingram, who both worked tirelessly with their students to prepare them for this competition. Congratulations to the students and well done to Canterbury College.
