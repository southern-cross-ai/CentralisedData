        The electorate of Fowler is the most multicultural in the country, so I have the privilege of attending many vibrant cultural and religious events and celebrations. I find that these events not only showcase and preserve the traditions of people's original homelands but demonstrate their commitment and gratitude to their new home, Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I again had the honour to speak at the opening of the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Moon Festival
        </a>
        event in Cabramatta. This is one of the biggest events in my local area, with more than 90,000 people from all around Sydney attending for the main celebrations on the Sunday. The food, music and many entertainment activities of various cultures of the Asian community truly showcased the diverse and multicultural nature of my electorate. In fact, I have one of the largest Asian communities outside Asia itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to praise the efforts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Fairfield City Council
        </a>
        ; its mayor,

        </a>
        ; and, in particular, the event coordinator, Cheryl Bosler, and her team for organising such a wonderful event. Cabramatta police, the

        </a>
        and the fire brigade were all on hand to ensure the safety of all those who turned out to celebrate this important community event.
       </p>
       <p>
        A couple of weeks ago, together with my wife, Bernadette, I also had the pleasure of attending the annual Friends of India Ganeshotsava celebrations at Liverpool's Whitlam Leisure Centre. We enjoyed a traditional south Indian dinner, maha prasadam, as well as a program rich in culture and tradition with classical singing and colourful dances by the children. I would like to thank my good friend Charishma Kaliyanda, who keeps me informed and updated and involved with the local Indian community. I would also like to thank all those who are involved with the Friends of India group for their wonderful contribution to our community.
       </p>

        Most recently I attended the Cabramatta Lions Club's Cambodian singing competition to raise funds for the Sovanapoom Care Orphanages in Cambodia. These orphanages provide boarding and day school, vocational training, a refugee centre and emergency food relief and medical care to close to 3,000 people a week. I thank my very good friend Jenny Tew and Sotha Bourn from the Cabramatta Lions Club as well as Virak Um from the Khmer Community Radio. I also recognise the work of the dedicated students from Canley Vale High School Leo Club, particularly their President,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Wong" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who deserves to be praised.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently attended the annual general meeting of the Great Lakes Agency for Peace and Development, an organisation bringing together refugees and migrants from across Africa. This organisation plays a key role in facilitating a strong cultural exchange between Australia and Africa and assisting migrants from various African countries to settle successfully here in Australia. I acknowledge the good work of Theophile Elongo, director-general of GLAPD and president of the Congolese Council of Australia, as well as Nadine Shema, director of public relations, for fostering a greater involvement of migrants from African countries in Australian society.

        Last weekend I had the honour of representing the Prime Minister at the official opening of the 24th Philippine Australian sports and culture festival, Fiesta Culture, at the Fairfield showground. I would like to thank

        , president of Philippine Australian Sports and Culture Incorporated, for his commitment to a strong presence and involvement by the Philippine community in Australian society. I also thank my good friend Francesco Marchesano, better known to many of us locally as Paul; Father Anthony; and also the president of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romano" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Romano
        </a>
        , for inviting me to the annual Our Lady of Mt Carmel Festival last weekend. Following mass I took part in the procession to the Mounties sports club complex. We enjoyed traditional foods, drinks and entertainment, all associated with the festivities of the parish community and paying a tribute to the nature and contribution of the Italian community in south-west Sydney. It certainly was a traditional Italian celebration.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just some of the events that truly showcase Australia's rich cultural diversity while celebrating and keeping alive the traditions and customs brought from people's homelands. I take pride and feel most privileged to attend these functions and see firsthand the full benefits of living in a diverse, vibrant, multicultural society.
