       <p>
        You're on fire today, Mr Speaker! Well done, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to move the following motion:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) before the election the Prime Minister promised on 97 occasions to reduce Australians' power bills by $275, but instead power bills have increased since he became Prime Minister;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) before the election the Prime Minister promised Australians cheaper mortgages, but instead there have been eight successive increases in mortgage interest rates since he became Prime Minister; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) before the election the Prime Minister promised Australians that he would not raise taxes on superannuation, and last week the Prime Minister announced a new tax on superannuation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) this Prime Minister is showing himself on issue after issue to be untrustworthy and deceptive, having told Australians one thing before the election and doing the opposite of what he promised now he is in government; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) as a result of the Prime Ministers' conduct, Australians are now unable to trust any of the promised he made; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) therefore calls on this Prime Minister to keep the promises he has made including in relation to reduced power bills, cheaper mortgages and not introducing new taxes on superannuation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion forthwith:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House:
