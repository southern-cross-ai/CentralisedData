        summers are hot, and that means classrooms can overheat, making the learning environment very uncomfortable for students and teachers. High temperatures and humidity obstructs learning, reduces student concentration and negatively impacts student behaviour. For example, since Worongary State School installed air conditioning in the year 2 student classrooms, there was a 30 per cent decrease in behaviour incidents, a 15 per cent increase in grades in maths and a 10 per cent increase in grades in English. I'm pleased that Worongary State School, Aquinas College Ashmore, Southport Flexible Learning Centre and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benowa_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">

        can now install the much-needed air conditioning in more classrooms through the Local Schools Community Fund. A comfortable classroom environment is essential for learning.

        Clearly the heat has affected the Queensland Labor government, as we saw them just last week backflip on their election policy. The Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        made the commitment nearly two years ago to put air conditioners in all classrooms. Since then, state Labor has refused to do the same. They said that we didn't need it because we have sea breezes on the Gold Coast. Eight months out from the election, they pull a rabbit from a hat and announced their supposed election promise to air condition all Queensland state schools. For these schools, air conditioning installed before the end of the year will make a massive difference for students and teachers. These are just some of the projects that have been successful in my electorate, and I look forward to visiting those schools in the coming weeks.
