         I thank the member for Cowper for his question. As I travel throughout the country I see a resilience in our people unmatched anywhere in the world. Regional people are very resilient people, whether it's drought, whether it's bushfires, whether it's the summer that we've hadâ€”indeed, the novel coronavirus 2019. The regions are meeting challenges head-on. Whether they're crayfishers in Geraldton or, indeed, tourism operators in Cairns or Rockhampton, they know that there are challenges ahead. They are meeting them. They are determined to build, to grow and to thrive as regional people always are. Together we will build back together. We will build back better.
        </p>
        <p>
         In January I went to Macksville in the Cowper electorate, where I met Judy Ward, Helen Rival and other staff at the local ex-services club. During the bushfire crisis they established a crucial coordination centre, which proved very valuable for the local community there. Judy and Helen epitomise what regional Australians are all about. They are meeting the challenges and also making them into opportunities to ensure that Macksville and other communities in Cowper can be their best selves. As a government we've addressed these challenges as well: a $2 billion National Bushfire Recovery Agency, putting $8 billion on the table for the drought and making sure that we're doing everything we can to protect public health and safety with the coronavirus outbreak.

         I'm asked about bringing forward investment. Look at the $2.9 billion in infrastructure that we have brought forward, with $571 million for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         to improve safety and efficiency, including the Pacific, Newell and Princes highways. I know the member for Page is particularly excited when we talk about the Woolgoolga-Ballina upgrade, where we've fast-tracked $20 million to complete that project this year. But it is every state and every territory: $1.3 billion for Queensland, $868 million for WA, $514 million for Victoria, $327 million for

          South Australia
         </a>
         , $173 million for Tasmania, $147 million for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">

         and $30 million for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I know the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
          McEwen
         </a>
         is completely pleased that the Hurstbridge railway commuter car pack, with 120 spaces, will be the first of 30 commuter car parks in Victoria to be delivered under our fast-track spending. That's particularly important for the member for McEwen. I know; I was in his electorate the other day. We were looking at infrastructure and looking at what could do for that particular part of the world. He's nodding in appreciation and recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Look at the

         bypass in the electorate of the member for Cowper: four lanes, 14 kilometres long, 12 sets of traffic lights avoided and thousands of vehicles removed from the town centre. Perhaps most importantly, part of the plan is 12,000 jobs created during construction.
