       <p>
        As a parliament, we often talk about the economic challenges that come with providing for our ageing population. This is very important, but it is equally important that we talk about the value that older Australians add to our communities, to our economy and to the Australian nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I organised a function in Adelaide to recognise the amazing community contributions by many older Australians within my electorate. At this function we asked local community groups to nominate older Australians who had made a valuable contribution to our community. These nominations came from local branches of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        and Meals on Wheels,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        divisions,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , neighbourhood watch groups and all sorts of other community organisations. I cannot think of an occasion when I was surrounded by more inspirational company. In the room we had 100 guests who had made some amazing contributions to our community. Whilst I would love to be able to share all of their stories, I recognise that this parliament cannot allow me the time do that, so I may just share a handful of examples of the sort of hardworking, dedicated volunteers who were honoured in my electorate last week.
       </p>
       <p>
        One example was Mrs Barbara Wilton, who was nominated by Prospect Meals on Wheels, where she has been a volunteer for 48 years. She served the first meal that was ever cooked in their kitchen. We also honoured Mr Lindsay Wills, who was nominated by the Rotary Club of Enfield, where he has been a member for 30 years; he has never missed a meeting. We honoured Mr Albert Bonython, who has been a worker at the Kilburn RSL for over 50 years. He is also a life member of the Kilburn Football Club and Kilburn Cricket Club and he was the originator of night football in Kilburn in the sixties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The examples are many. Mr

        brass band and several other community groups. There are a host of amazing contributions to our community. It is very important that as a parliament we recognise some of these fantastic achievements. Let me mention another person, Mr Stan Lesnicki
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Stan has been associated with Ethnic Broadcasters since 1975. He has been presenting the Polish radio program since commencing at the station; for 18 years he has successfully run the stationâ€™s sports program every Saturday afternoon. Now in his 80s, he is still producing and presenting his own program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all of these older Australians for their amazing contributions and for their contributions to our community. We will continue to honour them.
