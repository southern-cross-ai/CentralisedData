        I would like to congratulate this year’s entrants in the 2010 Crime Stoppers Youth Challenge. The challenge is an award-winning education program examining crime in the community. The program is an inquiry-based competition for students in years 5 to 10 in all Tasmanian schools. The youth challenge aims to educate youth as to the consequences of crime. The topic of the youth challenge this year was electronic-safety, with the focus on safe internet use, protecting your privacy online, and cyber bullying. I recently had the pleasure of attending the Crime Stoppers Youth Challenge Awards and it was my honour to present the winners with their prizes. With the use of internet and mobile phones becoming more prevalent in schools and the wider community, it was fantastic to see the efforts students put into their work in drawing attention to issues associated with e-safety.
       </p>

        To quote my state Labor colleague Mr Brian Wightman MP, who in his address drew on his experiences as a school principal:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schools cannot escape technology; they must learn to embrace it.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I would like to draw attention to the division winners: East Launceston Primary School,

        </a>
        , and the

        </a>
        ; and to the winners of the Commissioner’s Award, Lewis Arnold and Dana Devine. They produced powerful presentations. Congratulations again to all entrants and winners in the 2010 Crime Stoppers Youth Challenge.
