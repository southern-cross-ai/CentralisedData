          <p>
           I'm raising a point of order concerning what's just happened. You can't move dissent when no ruling has been made. When a point of order is raised, sometimes in response to a point of order a speaker will make a ruling. Sometimes in response to a point of order a speaker will give guidance to the House or to the person who is speaking or will simply indicate what will happen next. On the occasions when a speaker gives a ruling then dissent can be moved. But it is pretty hard to move dissent in a ruling when a ruling hasn't been made.

                    <p>
                     What has happened here is very clear. The opposition has asked an extremely tightly-worded question of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
                      Local Government
                     </a>
                     . The minister has, in a number of ways, sought to evade answering what is an extremely direct question. We, on this side of the House—both the Leader of the Opposition and I—have sought clarification from you. We've sought a ruling from you. A ruling has been provided. We've indicated that we disagree with the ruling. And what we are now doing is moving dissent. The reason that we are moving dissent is that you made a ruling that the minister was in order, and what we are putting to the House is that the minister was not in order because she was not being relevant to what was a very tightly worded, narrowly defined question. So that is the basis on which the opposition is moving dissent, as is permitted under standing order 87.

                         before the minister made her decision to reject the application?'—that was the first question, put by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. She did not answer that question. We then asked it a second time. The Leader of the Nationals asked: 'Did the minister or her office have any discussion with the Prime Minister or his office concerning the application for additional flights to and from Australia by Qatar Airways before the minister made her decision to reject the application?' Again she failed to answer the question.

                         We then had a question from the member for Riverina, where he asked whether or not the minister had spoken to Alan Joyce. Again she failed to answer the question. The Leader of the Opposition asked the question: 'Are you working in the interests of the Australian people?' And it's very clear you're not. Australians are paying more for their flights because of the protection racket that you have put in place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The questions continued, getting tighter and tighter by the question. The minister has failed to explain how her decision to reject the application for additional flights to and from Australia by Qatar Airways will benefit Australian consumers. The point I'm making, Mr Speaker—

                           Mr Speaker, the theme of this question time has been very clear, very clear indeed, and it's that the minister is running a protection racket for Qantas and she is making it a lot harder for Australian consumers, who are paying more for their flights. On this side of the House we stand up for Australians who are going through a very tough cost-of-living crisis. Interest rates are spiking under this government. Food is more expensive. People are having to cut corners everywhere in their family budgets. And, just when they need relief through flights, what do you do? You establish a protection racket with Qantas. This side of the House will always stand for the Australian people, for consumers. We will work to get a better deal for them. And the reason why we're dissenting, Mr Speaker, is that we want the minister to answer the questions.

                             has run a very significant commentary in relation to this important issue, and that is about whether or not this government has made an appropriate decision, and the actions of the minister—

                               I fully understand that, Mr Speaker, and I've given you the background as to why this issue needs to be dealt with in this chamber, why the question needs to be answered appropriately by this incompetent minister. The ruling that you've provided, Mr Speaker, should be dissented from because it allows this minister to continue to escape proper scrutiny in this chamber. She's a member of the executive. She refuses to say, in response to questions, whether or not she met or spoke with Mr
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce" rel="nofollow">

                               The relationship between Mr Alan Joyce, the Prime Minister and this minister is well documented. This is a murky situation at best. The minister's integrity is seriously in question. The Prime Minister had to come back into this chamber yesterday to correct the record when he misled this parliament. And why we need to move dissent in your ruling is obvious, because the question could not have been tighter. The circumstances could not be clearer. And the minister could not be more evasive. We need to hear from this minister, in a very direct way, whether or not she met with or spoke with Alan Joyce prior to making a decision to stop Qatar flying into our country which was of commercial benefit to Mr Joyce and to Qantas, and clearly to the detriment of the Australian flying public.

                               This government—and this is why your ruling needs to be dissented from—is costing, through this decision, Australians thousands of dollars through their airfares when they seek to travel internationally. Not just internationally, Mr Speaker. As we have seen from Virgin, who have an alliance with Qatar, if those inbound international flights are coming in and feeding the Virgin network, you will see a reduction in domestic airfare prices as well.

                                <p>
                                 Mr Speaker, the standing orders of this parliament are sacrosanct. We need to make sure the integrity of our Westminster system is upheld, and the requirement to do so falls squarely upon your shoulders. You are a decent Speaker. You're an honourable Speaker. But you have been put into the most difficult position by a minister who is trying to escape reality. You would not be put in this position that forced our hand to move dissent in your ruling if the minister had not been so evasive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Australians are demanding answers from this government. The Prime Minister's off on another overseas flight, and you've got this minister who refuses to answer questions in his absence. I don't think the Australian public are seeing a level of transparency, and that is why this minister has put this House into disrepute. And this is why, with all due respect to you, Mr Speaker, you should have upheld our point of order, moved that the minister was not in order, moved that the minister was not relevant to the question being asked, instead of the ruling that you made.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 This is a serious issue, and the precedent here is important because, to be honest, this is not the first occasion where we have contemplated whether we move dissent because of the way in which the government has put you into a difficult position. Today is a red-letter day for this minister because the minister has a clear question before her. Will she answer it honestly? So far she hasn't, and the Australian public demand nothing less of her.
                                </p>

                                  It's a pleasure to follow both the Leader of the Opposition and the former future leader of the Liberal Party on what is one of the silliest moments I can imagine of a dissent motion. If this was the test of whether or not you move dissent, we would have had a dissent motion every question time every day for the previous nine years. That's what we would have had.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  What they're objecting to is the fact that the standing order simply says you have to be relevant. That's what they're actually objecting to. That's their problem that they have. If you have a look at the question, it asked, in the end part of it, about Qatar's application before the decision was made.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  What made them outraged, what suddenly enlivened them, was when the minister started to refer to what the situation was before the application was made. It's exactly what she was referring to. She was referring to the situation the previous government had left in place. The question specifically invited an answer about what the circumstances were before the application had been made. If you don't want an answer about what the circumstances were before the application was made, then don't be so idiotic as to ask a question as to what the circumstances were before the application was made.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  The reason they've done this is really simple: they have given up on a debate about cost of living, completely given up. They are embarrassed, completely embarrassed, about the economic accounts that have come out today. They are embarrassed that inflation has been going down, they are embarrassed that wages have been going up and they are embarrassed about having to sit on the opposition benches seeing a government deliver a surplus that they were never capable of.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Amidst that embarrassment, you fall back to all you've got left: 'Maybe we can manufacture a procedural argument.' And how desperate were they to get to a procedural argument? There was the desperation of the Leader of the Opposition saying: 'Can you give me a ruling? Can this please be a ruling? Please give me a ruling so we can talk about something other than policy. Please give us a reason to interrupt the minister when she is about to refer to what the situation was before that application.'
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  While it is certainly disorderly in this place for me to call anyone a hypocrite, there is extraordinary hypocrisy in the debate when you look at previous behaviour and what the circumstances were before that application was made. We have a minister for transport here who has acted in the national interest for this country. We have a minister here, in Minister King, who has made decisions, and then the outrage—

                                    The outrage that they have about the minister being in a situation, in the questions that have been raised in the debate—we've had all the different questions raised in the debate. It was bizarre while we had the earlier ones in a question about relevance on this one. But, as we heard the different questions, a whole series of them simply went to: did a minister conduct due diligence and talk to stakeholders? I'm not surprised they are shocked that ministers do that these days. It used to be the case that a minister wouldn't even have to talk to colleagues, because the Prime Minister could just talk to a mirror and have the whole cabinet present! They were all there! Who needed stakeholders? Who needed anyone to consult with? The Prime Minister of the day could just have a quiet chat with himself, and everything was okay.

                                      Mr Speaker, it's on standing order 91(e), disorderly conduct. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to listen to both major parties talk about what is appropriate under standing orders or not, but there are members of the Australian public sitting in this chamber at the moment watching this behaviour, and I do not believe this behaviour is befitting of this chamber.

                                      If we could please have this debate and have it reasonably, without yelling at each other, that would be in the best interests of everyone.

                                            Once again, even that point of order shows the contempt they have for this parliament. Even that point of order shows exactly how they used to run things and how they wish things still were, where they get to make a point and no-one gets to answer it in return. That is precisely what they are wanting to have happen here. That's the only reason that point of order could have possibly been raised, but there's some sort of outrage that a different point of view is given in this parliament.
