        If the measure of a community is how it treats its sick, its disabled and those at end of life then Noosa should be commended. It has two unique places that are treasured safe havens for those that are ignored or worse in less fortunate corners of the world. Sunshine Butterflies is a disability support charity, and Katie Rose hospice cares for people navigating their final phase of life. They are community driven not-for-profits and valued by the Noosa community, who donate to them regularly, fundraise for them and volunteer for them.

        When it comes to government support, none are more deserving. That's why the Morrison-Joyce government announced $1.5 million to extend Katie Rose Cottage Hospice so that more terminally ill people and their families navigating the final stages of life can be supported. Simply put, Katie Rose is where families can truly say goodbye to their loved ones. It's where the dying share their final moments with family and friends in a comfortable home environment with dedicated, professional and compassionate care. The difference is that the dying mother at Katie Rose can watch a child playing around her, swimming in the pool and exploring the garden rather than be alone in a cold hospital room. A dying father can eat a home-cooked meal and share a room with his wife on his final night. The bereaved whom Katie Rose Cottage support could not speak more highly of it, because they have been helped during the most challenging time of their lives. Our commitment to Katie Rose hospice will mean that 20 further people from the

        While Katie Rose cares for the dying and their families, Sunshine Butterflies changes the lives of individuals with disabilities and their families. The vibrant, home based

        at Cooroibah will now feature an accessible playground, cafe and stage roof over an accessible stage with the help of a $135,000 grant from the Morrison-Joyce government. It's a place that delights children of all ages with music, colour and movement. There are chooks, ponies and peacocks, and now they will have a playground from which no child, no matter their disability, will be excluded.

        To Carol Raye, Leanne Walsh and your teams: you have shown what a community that cares can achieve with dedication and perseverance. I extend my heartfelt thanks to both of those people for doing what they do in their wonderful establishments.
