         I thank the member for Bendigo for her question and for working with local employers to access the scheme and also, importantly, for welcoming all those Pacific workers that are right now in Bendigo contributing to the local economy.

         The Albanese Labor government is deeply committed to a stronger economy and to deepening our relationship with the Pacific. The Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PALM" rel="nofollow">
          PALM
         </a>
         , is critical to that. It was created by Labor in 2012 through this
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWP" rel="nofollow">
          SWP
         </a>
         , and we're improving it now that we're in government again. We're improving it by reducing the travel costs for employers utilising the scheme. We're improving it by allowing workers on long-term visas to bring their families. We're improving it by increasing protections against worker exploitation. And we're improving it by expanding the number of sectors that can access the scheme. And I'm proud to inform the House that this is already paying off. We've got a record number of Pacific workers in the economy already—over 27,000—and nearly 400 employers are accessing the scheme. This is critical to filling our labour shortages while we train Australians right now. It's making a huge difference in the Pacific. One-third of the 15 million Pacific islanders live on less than $20 a week. In contrast, the average worker in this scheme, on a long-term visa, sends back $15,000 to a year. Imagine the impact for their families and communities with $15,000 going back to them each year.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've had the privilege of seeing the impact of this scheme firsthand. I recently visited the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         and met Joeseph and Gerard, who had returned after three years in Australia. Not only did they benefit from that scheme; they developed critical skills that are now allowing them to set up new businesses in the Solomon Islands. I met people training to be meat workers and hospitality workers who are so excited about this scheme. While I was in Suva with the Prime Minister, I visited a training centre where 40 enthusiastic women were training to be aged-care workers in Australia. They are now in Australia doing their practical training in the lead up to working in regional Queensland. I'm delighted to say there are 40,000 pre-screened workers ready to go.
        </p>
        <p>
         We anticipate that, each year, this scheme will inject over $360 million into the economies of the Pacific islands, which will be vital in some countries where remittances make up up to 40 per cent of their
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         . This is a vital scheme that helps the Australian economy, lifts families out of poverty and strengthens our relationship with the Pacific.
