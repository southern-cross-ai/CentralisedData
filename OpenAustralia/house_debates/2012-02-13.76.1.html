        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. How is the government keeping our economy strong and helping Australians make ends meet? Can the minister outline what other opinions have been put forward and how these would impact on working people?

         I would like to thank the member for his question. In his electorate, courtesy of this government's reform of superannuation, 31,000 of his constituents can expect to increase their superannuation entitlements from nine per cent to 12 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are three ways in which this government is assisting Australians to deal with the future and making sure that people can make ends meet. The first way is by achieving a surplus, the second way is by supporting jobs and the third way is by having a view about the future and a positive plan for the future. We are achieving surplus. In the last budget—

              When you look at Australia's position compared to the rest of the world and you have a look at the Commonwealth net debt, you will see that we are doing far better. We are at 8.5 per cent.

              But it is not just about the surplus; we are supporting jobs. That is why we have a manufacturing policy which stands up for the automotive industry.

              Those opposite may laugh, but their policy is to buy a white flag and a European car. We are also standing up for apprenticeships—130,000 new places next year. We are also standing up for industry and jobs by using the mining tax to help provide a tax cut for small business. This is the contrast when we talk about supporting jobs. The difference between Labor and Liberal could be no starker or clearer than when it comes to the mining tax. We want to use the mining tax to lift people's retirement savings. We want to use the mining tax to help small business. They want to use the mining tax to give a multibillion dollar tax break to billionaires.
