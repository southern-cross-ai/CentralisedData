       <p>
        I rise today to talk about the significant milestone of two ministers in the local Anglican community in my electorate. On 28 January, Reverend Barry Butler AM and his wife Margaret, along with Reverend Patricia Williams and her husband Keith celebrated their diamond 60th anniversaries. I was fortunate enough to be invited along to the celebrations on 7 February; however, it was a significant milestone for my family, with my mum turning 70 on that day. We were actually here in Canberra, so while it was great to be able to spend some time with Mum, unfortunately I was not able to spend time with the other two families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to leaving for Canberra I did catch up with Reverend Patricia and we were able to have a look at the cards from the Prime Minister and the Queen. I know all couples really appreciated those sentiments. I would like to thank Reverend Keith Joseph for making me aware of this very special occasion in the community and also for making sure I was invited to come along. I wish the Anglican community all the very best. I hope these couples are very happy and there are many years left in their marriages. They are wonderful people. I wish them all the very best.
