       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate the Launceston Community Legal Centre for its success in Volunteering Tasmania's recent Tasmanian Volunteering Awards for 2017. It was my very great pleasure to nominate the Launceston Community Legal Centre to be recognised for its role in advocating for the most disadvantaged in our community through its successful Legal Literacy program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Launceston Community Legal Centre seeks volunteers for its services through Volunteering Tasmania's website. As part of the selection process, volunteers receive four days of initial training over a four-week period. The program run by the Launceston Community Legal Centre has a high satisfaction rate, and a particularly high retention rate. Volunteers are encouraged to mentor, buddy and support each other in their work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legal Literacy program uses local, non-legally-trained volunteers to help other members of their community to complete documents and forms of all kinds correctly. The volunteers also write letters, identify legal needs and refer people to timely legal assistance as required. Since the legal literacy service was established, volunteers have helped over 2,000 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are 54 active Legal Literacy program volunteers in nine locations across the north-east of Tasmania. Legal Literacy program volunteers bridge the gap between the traditional areas of law, welfare, health, education and community. Practical assistance is the result, and the Bass community benefits from an innovative program.
