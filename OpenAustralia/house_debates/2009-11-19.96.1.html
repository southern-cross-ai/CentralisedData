        I have been receiving many emails and other expressions of support from my constituents on the issue of school chaplains. Louise, from Willetton, says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am writing to ask that you request the renewal of the school chaplaincy program beyond 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have seen the wonderful work that our chaplain, and those at Ardross, Thornlie and Yale primary schools do with our children and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Geraldine, of Leeming, says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am aware of the importance of having the services of a school chaplain. I believe that funding needs to be secured for chaplaincy so we can have a wholesome educational system and I urge you to ensure this happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the same vein, Gaye, from Riverton, says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They do an excellent job and are much appreciated by school staff and students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wendy, from Shelley, says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our youth as a whole are bombarded by so much media pressure and an objective listener can be the difference between life and death decisions sometimes, and chaplains are a great neutral role model between students and their teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Donald, of Willetton, says that it would be ‘a grievous error if federal funding was not continued’. He goes on:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In these days of violence amongst our youth, this programme is essential for the well-being of our youth.
       </p>
       <p>
        One mother simply says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … please continue funding for school chaplains. The Applecross school chaplain has been so helpful to my son.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just a small sample of the messages that I have been getting; words from the heart of grateful people. Mind you, to hear the member for Fowler on 19 October, you would think these were all wild-eyed, religious fundamentalists whose only goal was to brainwash our children. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Perhaps the only reason she never received a request for a chaplain was that the people knew that such a request would fall on deaf ears. These chaplains are fine, caring people whose aim is to help, console, listen to, advise and comfort by filling a role not filled by teachers and, sadly, sometimes not by parents. I have not received one complaint about any school chaplain from anyone in my electorate. I have only heard good things; unsolicited expressions of support for people who do a tough job.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not sure whether the member for Fowler objects to chaplains because they have a faith—heaven forbid—or whether they are hard to unionise. Her virtually Marxist view of the world certainly does not fit with the reality of chaplains in Tangney schools. Her snide and contemptuous slur of ‘praise the Lord and pass the Ritalin’ plumbs new depths in the character assassination so beloved of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Left" rel="nofollow">
         Far Left
        </a>
        . As for the bleating about using money for better things, perhaps she does not realise that at least in Tangney part of the funding is provided from the community, not from Treasury.
