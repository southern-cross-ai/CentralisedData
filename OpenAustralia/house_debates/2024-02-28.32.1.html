        I was pleased to join our community in bidding farewell to Reverend Ric Holland, a local legend, on Sunday. Reverend Ric is a compassionate, energetic and progressive individual committed to improving the lives in the communities he serves. He has enjoyed an esteemed, multifaceted senior management career in Australia and overseas. Reverend Ric has balanced roles both as an ordained minister and as a senior executive in the not-for-profit sector, including as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Melbourne City Mission.
       </p>
       <p>
        I especially want to thank him for his incredible support for our community as the minister of Hampton Park Uniting Church and as the vice-chair and former chairperson of Hampton Park Community House. For years, under his leadership, the Hampton Park Uniting Church has helped thousands of people in our community by ensuring they get access to support services such as food relief, free legal services and playgroups. His selfless contribution has been driven by a genuine commitment to further embed the church and the community house as welcoming places of support, inclusion and empowerment. I thank you for your invaluable service, Reverend Ric.
