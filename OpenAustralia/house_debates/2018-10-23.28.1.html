        Ever since the member for Cook became Prime Minister, he's tried to convince Australians that they need to move on, that there's nothing to see here, that he somehow pulled a Bradbury to become the leader. Well, Australians aren't buying it. They're still asking: why is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        no longer the Prime Minister? But we know why. We know this didn't come about by some miraculous turn of events that accidentally installed the bloke next door with the cap and the lapel pin.

        <i>
         The Saturday Paper

        revealed that he replaced Malcolm Turnbull by ambition, doublecrossing and outfoxing, with the Minister for

        </a>
        as an unwitting stooge. No wonder the Prime Minister refers to his own government as a muppet show. He played his own party like muppets, creating an illusion of support for the Minister for Home Affairs only to come from behind and pull the leadership rug from under his feet. It's like

        but without all the good bits!

        Australians cannot trust this Prime Minister, because they cannot trust a man who denies that he has blood on his hands. They cannot trust a man who simply tells them to move on. They cannot trust a man who rewards treachery with cabinet positions and who lurches from one thought bubble to the next and calls that policy. They cannot trust a man who is immune to introspection and instead blames all and sundry for the demoralising defeat in Wentworth. It doesn't matter how many caps or how many lapel pins this Prime Minister wears; Australians will never get an answer to the question of why Malcolm Turnbull is no longerâ€”
