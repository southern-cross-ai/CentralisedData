       <p>
        On Friday, 19 October I had the pleasure of attending the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        Show. I met some scouts, and I know that the scouts have just been given a volunteer grant of $4,000 to assist them with a trailer and barbecue. I congratulate the Flinders Island Show committee, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        , the show stewards, the bar staff and the catering volunteers, as well as the Flinders Island Council for their support of this annual event. What a great show Flinders Island people put on. It was a great event.
       </p>
       <p>
        One example of how important this was for the community is Aunty Phyllis, who is well known and well loved on the island. Phyllis has been a committed mentor for young Aboriginal people. She has been involved as an elder and mentor in meenah mienne—'my dream'—an arts based pilot project for Aboriginal youth in the youth justice system, and she visits and mentors Aboriginal people at the Ashley Youth Detention Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phyllis has worked tirelessly for the Tasmanian community throughout the mainland in youth justice, housing, family violence, Aboriginal wellbeing and Aboriginal women's health. She is highly regarded as a passionate advocate for the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, their identity, culture and traditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I offer my congratulations to Gillian Woods, the recipient of the Flinders Island citizenship award for her hard work in the community. Gillian was nominated by community members in recognition of her ongoing support and fundraising efforts for the
