       <p>
        Over the last two months I have been travelling around Australia holding many public forums and consultations on my portfolio responsibilities. I have been very pleased with the response that I have had, particularly the youth consultations. Last week I hosted a consultation in the Campbelltown area of south-western Sydney where one-quarter of the population are under 25 years of age. The area is home to many young people, and many of these young people experience some disadvantage or multiple disadvantages. There was a terrific turnout from not only young people but also children’s lawyers, youth workers, youth centre health workers, youth homelessness service workers and advocates from other youth organisations. I was particularly pleased to welcome a number of youth workers in training from the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        college.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people in Campbelltown raised many of the issues that, unfortunately, have been raised with me time and time again around this country. I say ‘unfortunately’ because they are issues of great concern. The first thing that is often raised with me is the lack of interest that is shown by the federal government in youth issues and the way that is demonstrated in the breakdown of the youth representative structures that used to exist in Australia—the defunding of the Australian Youth Policy in Action Coalition and the halving of the National Youth Roundtable. I am pleased to note that they are meeting in Canberra today, although the lack of resourcing and the halving of the number of youth representatives on that roundtable is certainly of concern. People also raise the fact that there is no longer a youth minister. The fact that youth issues are not represented around the cabinet table is very serious. The effects on young people losing their right to vote with the changes to electoral enrolment is an issue that is always raised.

        Health issues are raised, as is mental health, including depression and youth suicide. The rate of youth suicide has decreased in recent years, but we still have one of the highest rates in the Western world. Also, young people always raise their experiences in the workplace and how they fear that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        legislation will have a terrible effect on vulnerable workers. The notion that a 17-year-old can walk in and negotiate on an equal level with Coca-Cola Amatil or some large employer is just nonsense. Young people understand that, as do their parents, and they constantly raise the issue. At a time when we have a significant budget surplus, young people cannot understand the lack of funding for TAFE and they cannot understand why there are now more than 60 degrees which cost $100,000 or more. They cannot understand, with the incredibly high rates of youth unemployment, why we are still turning young people away from TAFE and importing apprentices from overseas.
