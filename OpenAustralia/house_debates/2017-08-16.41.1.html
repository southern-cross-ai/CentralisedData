        The () (): Now for something that means something to real people. In November last year I had a couple of my younger constituents come to see me about their desire to see a skatepark or some form of youth facility constructed near where they live. About 10 days ago, eight months after that initial visit, I was able to stand with those two young lads to announce $1 million in funding under the Liberal-National government's Building Better Regions Funds for the Mackay Skate Park &amp; Wheeled Sports Plaza project. It was a very rewarding outcome in a relatively short space of time, with collaboration occurring at all levels of government. The Mackay Skate Park &amp; Wheeled Sports Plaza is a $2.2 million project which will deliver the region's first competition standard skatepark and wheeled sports plaza, in partnership with the Mackay Police Citizens Youth Club. The state-of-the-art facility will cater for beginners through to advanced riders.

        Ethan Laval and Flynn Bushell were 12 years old when they called into my office to talk about their dream for a skate park. They conducted surveys and met with local councillors. The council subsequently did more investigation of the need and determined that a regional skate park of competition standard was needed in our region. They lodged an application under the Building Better Regions Fund, which I lobbied for as well. It was one of 100 successful applications from a field of around 500. I want to congratulate the council but, more importantly, congratulate Ethan and Flynn on their drive and enthusiasm. I look forward to seeing the completion of their dream in a year's time.
