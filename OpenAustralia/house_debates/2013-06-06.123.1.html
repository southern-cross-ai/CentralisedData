        . This is not quality journalism—not by any stretch of the imagination or by any measure of journalistic standards. No wonder the circulations of newspapers are going down. Advertisement figures are down, circulation is down, and Mr Murdoch is hitting the panic button. Mr Murdoch is now in Australia to administer the latest poison pill. Next week he will flag through the separation of his profitable entertainment business and the underperforming newspapers. But you will not be reading the real agenda in
        <i>

        </i>
        or
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        . They have to look after their master. They cannot talk about job cuts or how Mr Murdoch is trying to siphon away his profitable asset and kill off anything that is not making money. Well, I have some advice for Mr Murdoch: if he wants to cut more costs out of his unprofitable assets, he can start right here and get rid of this tripe.
       </p>
       <p>
        But let's be realistic: he will not. Expect more tripe. Expect more stories about reporters falling into pot plants and/or almost knocking politicians over. It was not meant as a serious report—just one to ridicule a politician, and not just any politician, mind you, but a Labor politician. Why? Because it fits Mr Murdoch's political and business agenda to knock this Labor government. Make no mistake: Mr Murdoch's political and business agenda are one and the same. If it is good for Mr Murdoch's business, he will support it. If it is bad, he will knock it down and destroy it. If citizenship gets in the way of business expediency, he will trade it in for another. If a newspaper and its staff get caught up in a phone-hacking scandal, do not expect Mr Murdoch to accept personal responsibility. He will blame the journalists, blame the editors, blame everyone else and then shut the newspaper down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian employees of Mr Murdoch should not expect a better response when their turn to face the axe comes, and it will come soon. Why? Because it is expedient for business. The financial bottom line comes first and foremost, ahead of all else. The standard of tripe reflects Mr Murdoch's standards. He is not interested in the content as such, but the editors know what is expected. That is why the
        <i>
         News of the World
        </i>
        scandal happened in the United Kingdom. Everyone knew what was expected. What they did not count on was that they would be the fall guys for a bigger picture—a picture that had room for one man alone.

        How dare Rupert Murdoch tweet: 'Oz polls show nothing can save this miserable government. Election cannot come soon enough. People decided and tuned out months ago.' The reason people tune out, Mr Murdoch, is because of the tripe served up in your tabloids and your cross-promotion of that tripe. Everyone knows you twist the political agenda to suit your business agenda and in so doing you crush and corrupt our democracy. We are not frightened of you and we will not surrender to your massive media power encapsulated in your tweet.
