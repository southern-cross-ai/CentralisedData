       <p>
        I rise to talk about a very important issue in my community, which is raising awareness about domestic violence. Next week, in conjunction with the Tweed Valley Women's Service at Murwillumbah, I am very pleased that, together, we have organised a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         White Ribbon
        </a>
        event to raise awareness about domestic and family violence right throughout our community. On Tuesday, 17 November, concerned members of the community are invited to come together to sign a pledge and decorate a tree to commemorate and acknowledge White Ribbon Day, and show their support for ending violence against women. The event will be followed by a morning tea, and it will be held next Tuesday at 10 o'clock at the Tweed Shire Women's Service at Murwillumbah.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a former police officer, I saw firsthand, on so many occasions, the devastating impact of domestic violence on women and children, and upon our community. We all have a responsibility to act. We are holding this event to help break the silence around violence and to raise awareness of the issue, because we all know violence against women is now at epidemic proportions. Devastatingly, over 12 months, on average, one woman is killed every week in Australia. This is outrageous. People need to know they can make a difference, and bringing an end to violence really will take a whole community approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to commend Tracy Asby and all of those in the Tweed Valley Women's Service. I also want to commend all of our police and emergency service workers, and those in our community organisationsâ€”all of whom are working so hard to end violence against women and children in our community.
