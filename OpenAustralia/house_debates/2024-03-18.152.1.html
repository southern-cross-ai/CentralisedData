        I'd like to acknowledge today and remember the incredible life of local icon, Paul
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill" rel="nofollow">
         O'Neill
        </a>
        . Paul sadly passed away last week at the age of 64. Whether it was the Lismore Speedway, the Marist Brothers Rugby League Club or Lismore Nissan, Paul was passionate about treating everyone like his family, and he loved Lismore.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul had an incredibly successful sedan racing career at the Lismore Speedway. He rose through the ranks, becoming one of Australia's most well-known names in the racing scene. He won the Australian Grand National Sedan Championship in two consecutive years, in 1986 and 1987. His greatest victory during his racing career was when he won against the Americans at the Lismore Speedway, as a member of the Australian team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joining the Marist Brothers Rugby League Club, Paul helped to turn it into a financially secure club with a strong and successful team of players, and he very much drove it to have a strong community focus. He owned Lismore Nissan, and he had a great passion for excellent service at the dealership, securing 11 years in a row of being awarded the Elite Dealer Excellence Award. Here Paul and his wife, Wendy, worked daily. I'd like to express, on behalf of myself and my wife, Karen, our deepest condolences to Wendy, to Paul Jr and Molly, and to Victoria and Nick. We know that you will miss him deeply, as will many in our community, for the generosity that he showed. Rest in peace,

        I'd like to acknowledge and thank Maria Pagotto for 44 years of volunteering in our community, including at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Vincent's" rel="nofollow">
         St Vincent's
        </a>
        hospital in Lismore. Turning 97 this year, Maria has spent her time at the hospital helping patients, staff and the chapel. She first spent time at the hospital as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        member. Maria did hair and beauty care for rehabilitation patients. She did this for 28 years. She transferred to the day surgery, handing out cups of tea and sandwiches. The patients always noted their happiness because of Maria's dedication in the way she served them. Maria also spent 17 years at the Italian aged care, keeping patients company and looking after them. After transferring to the south Lismore Catholic parish church, Maria spent 15 years volunteering, continuing to become the Eucharistic minister at the Saturday evening mass.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of Maria's most cherished achievements include spending 33 years as a member of the Red Cross and receiving the service award in 2004 for 22 years of valuable service, and she is still serving as a volunteer today. I'd like to thank and acknowledge Maria for her important contributions to the local community through her volunteering efforts.
