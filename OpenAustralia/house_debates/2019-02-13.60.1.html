        Eleven years ago today I watched in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as the Prime Minister said sorry. Saying sorry was not the hard part. The hard part was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        choosing to accept the apology in the spirit in which it was given. And they did. I had the honour that day of spending time with Heather Vicenti, who had travelled from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        . She had been taken from her mother at two years of age. Indigenous Australians like Heather came from all over our country. Many entered through the Prime Minister's courtyard and many sat on the lawns at the front of parliament. A whole nation watched as the parliament said sorry and we as a nation took an important step in a healing journey.

        In the 31 years this building has stood, I believe the apology was the best day in this building. Political rivals worked together. I have a photo in my office of Dr Brendan Nelson and former Prime Minister Rudd shaking hands at the conclusion of the apology. I think it was one of the beautiful moments that happened in this chamber. It was a proud day to be an Australian. I'm equally proud of the work that the member for Jagajaga did and the work that former Prime Minister Gillard did in making sure that we continue to honour the spirit of the apology.
