        Basketball Victoria recently announced the 2023 under-16 state teams, and it was a slam dunk for Sunbury. Impressively, the under-16 Victorian country men's team includes

        Having four athletes from the Sunbury Basketball Association make a state team at the same time is a huge credit to the whole association's hard work and dedication to their sport. Whether it's the coaches, other players or their families backing them in, it takes a whole team behind every player. It's a credit to people like President Darren Watkins, whose work to empower the members of the Sunbury Basketball Association is off the charts. Thanks, Darren, for all that you do. But the accolades don't stop there. I'm also pleased to report that the Sunbury Basketball Association has three

I'll keep working with the Sunbury Basketball Association to build on this so that kids in Sunbury can have the opportunities they deserve well into the future. Go, Jets!
