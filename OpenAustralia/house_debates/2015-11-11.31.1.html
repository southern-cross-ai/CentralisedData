       <p>
        Last night I attended the Australian Primary Principals Association launch of its Charter on Primary Schooling here in parliament house. I once again acknowledge the critical role primary school staff throughout Australia have in creating a future for children and the sometimes undervalued role that they have on a child's formative years. When I visit any of the primary schools in my electorate I am always most impressed by the level of care and commitment for each child displayed by staff, with staff often going well beyond what is required of them. As the principals say in the brochure issued last night:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Primary schools teach our children and contribute to our nation's future. They embrace the responsibility of giving children the academic and social foundations for leading fulfilled and enriched lives. In our school communities, each child's identity and culture are celebrated; personal responsibility is encouraged and expected; and, the knowledge and skills are gained to become independent and lifelong learners.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that statement sums up the important role that they play.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to thank the staff of all the primary schools in the electorate of Makin, which I represent, schools which I not only visit on a regular basis but keep in touch with by reading their newsletters, for all that they do to ensure that the children that they are given custody and care of are given the best start in life that they can have.
