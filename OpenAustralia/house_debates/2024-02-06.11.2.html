        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Sweden and United Kingdom from 31 October to 9 November 2023, and ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.

        I am very pleased to speak to the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom and Sweden which took place from 31 October to 9 November last year. It was a great privilege to act as leader for this delegation, and I thank the members for

        , Wright and Blair for their support, expertise and contributions during the delegation. The delegation worked well together, and brought a variety of interests and knowledge of issues, which proved to be valuable during our meetings and discussions. The delegation, held in early November, visited Stockholm in Sweden as well as England and Scotland.
       </p>

        I would like to add my appreciation and thanks to

        The delegation aimed to strengthen the important parliamentary links with Sweden and the United Kingdom and to discuss issues of common interest and concern. Main topics of discussion included A

We received a briefing on the operation from the contingent commander, visited the training area to observe Ukrainian recruits undergoing weapons and tactical training, and we engaged with the Australian and Ukrainian soldiers. The delegation members recognised the professionalism, care and expertise of the Australian soldiers taking part in the training of the Ukrainian citizens, and we appreciate the conversations and hospitality that were shown to us during our visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the delegation, I would like to record our appreciation for the work that went into preparing such a successful trip, including the arrangements made by the staff of the International and Parliamentary Relations Office and briefings provided by the

        </a>
        . I would also like to thank His Excellency, Mr Pontus Melander, Ambassador of Sweden to Australia, on the briefing he gave us, which provided insightful information before the delegation's arrival in Sweden. I would also like to record my thanks to Mr Peter Banson, Deputy Clerk of the House of Representatives, who accompanied the delegation to provide logistic and secretarial support and advice. His assistance was appreciated by us all. The delegation presented a valuable opportunity to strengthen bonds with the UK and Sweden, and we were pleased to be able to hold useful discussions and promote matters of importance to Australia. I commend the report to the House.
