       <p>
        On Friday I attended the Station Street Men's Shed open day. It was in fact more of an 'opening day' because it was the first time they opened up the place. They have not as yet used any of the machines and I know that because there was no blood or sawdust on the floor. It was great that the member for Berowra, the Chief Government Whip, could join me at the opening as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many members of the public were there. It was also an opportunity for the wives to come along and see where their husbands would be spending some of their 'shed time'. It was mentioned during a speech that that was the first and only opportunity for the wives to see or gain entry into that particular men's shed. However, the rules are not yet set in concrete.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also present were Mr Kevin Morris, the Station Street Men's Shed committee secretary, who also works with the Canning Horticultural and Recreation Society. The men's shed location is in Cannington, as I said, just behind the Cannington Greyhounds. I know that many people in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        will know exactly where that is in Cannington. The horticultural and recreation society has granted a lease and, when the new development for the Cannington Greyhounds goes ahead where they will relocate the actual greyhound track further behind where it currently is, that will be moved and there will be a new location for the men's shed. It will still be local for the local men.

        , a resource recovery organisation, was there as well. It presented a $5,000 cheque to the men's shed. Mr Nial Stock, WA's SITA general manager, was also present. The grant of $5,000 was part of a $96,000 program launched by SITA in October 2013. This is an example of corporate philanthropy, working at its best in the local community. SITA have a facility in my electorate of Swan, at the Welshpool Resource Recovery Centre, which I have toured with the local member for Belmont, Mrs Glenys Godfrey. SITA of Welshpool is home to a number of resource and recovery waste management activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate everyone who attended the event on Friday, including the people from the Canning Horticultural and Recreation Society, who provided the facilities. Also, thanks to the members who provided a barbecue lunch afterwards and also to SITA which provided the celebration cake to kick off the Station Street Men's Shed.
