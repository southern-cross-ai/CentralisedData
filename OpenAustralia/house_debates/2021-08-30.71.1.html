        [by video link] My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how sticking to the Morrison-Joyce government's national plan will ensure access to a secure regional workforce both now and as we continue a safe pathway out of the COVID-19 pandemic? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. I might briefly also acknowledge the passing of Senator Alex Gallacher, whom I worked with. Alex and Senator Sterle were best of mates. I know Sterlo will be taking this pretty tough as well. To Paola: I wish you all the best. I'll have more to say on Alex at a later stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the member for Nicholls for his question and note what he and his people are currently dealing with in Shepparton. I note that it is a hotspot and that he has been in close contact with us all the way through, making absolutely certain that his messages get through to me and that his requests get through to the Treasurer. He is a champion for his people. He's always at the forefront, parochial and hardworking, and I thank him for that.
        </p>
        <p>
         He also knows, with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPC" rel="nofollow">
          SPC
         </a>
         and the horticultural and farming industries in his electorate, how vitally important it is that we continue on this program of suppression of the virus as we drive towards making sure we hit our targets so that we can give back to the Australian people the liberties and freedoms that they were born with and that they expect to get back. We know this is vitally important, because there is a connection from the paddock to your dinner plate. If we can't make sure that we get through this as quickly as possible—and we are—then you don't have the farm workers to pick the produce, you don't have the processors to process the produce and you don't have the transport workers from the union that Senator Gallacher was from, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">

         , to get them to the supermarkets; therefore, you don't have dinner on your plate.
        </p>
        <p>
         All these things are connected, and the people in regional Australia are fundamentally connected to the people of every suburb of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. But we are driving forward with this process. In greater Shepparton, 57 per cent of people have received at least one inoculation. We are driving forward with this process: last week, two million people were inoculated. We're driving forward with this process: 57 per cent of Australians now have had at least their first shot. We are making sure that we continue on with this task. It is disappointing that I get a sense that some on the opposite side aren't hoping for the future but are hoping for failure, because we are making absolutely certain—
