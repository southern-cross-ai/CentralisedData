       <p>
        I would like to highlight the importance of the aged-care industry. The aged-care industry is one of the largest industries in my electorate. With the exception of local government, it would be the largest employer in most of the major centres in the Parkes electorate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aged_care" rel="nofollow">
         Aged care
        </a>
        is a highly specialised and professional career. I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to visit most of the aged-care centres in my electorate. I have seen firsthand the incredible level of care given to residents in these facilities and also the very high standards set by management and staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is evident that the number of people requiring aged care is increasing, but this increase in numbers has not led to a decrease in services. In fact, I would say it is the opposite. I have witnessed the professionalism of aged-care providers throughout my electorate over the last six months and can honestly say that the services provided are of the highest quality. Therefore, I was appalled by the comments made in relation to aged care in the House on 13 March this year by the Minister for Ageing,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Elliot" rel="nofollow">
         Justine Elliot
        </a>
        . The ministerâ€™s comments were demeaning to the entire aged-care industry and, as the shadow parliamentary secretary for ageing, I have had many aged-care providers tell me how disappointed they were that the minister made such callous remarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        All the nursing homes in my electorate have contented residents who are well cared for. These facilities should be applauded, not belittled by the minister. On 13 March the minister referred to her previous experience as a police officer. She needs to understand that her role as a minister is not purely an investigative one. She also needs to show leadership and give support to the tens of thousands of people employed in the aged-care industry.
