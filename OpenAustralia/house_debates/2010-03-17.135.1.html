        can look forward to another exciting project funded under the second round of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. As we know, this program has provided the single largest investment in local infrastructure in the nation’s history, now totalling in the order of $1 billion. A total of $387,000 has been allocated for a new public exhibition space in Shellharbour Village, a place where we can exhibit local art and craft and promote the tourist potential of this area. This comes on top of the $900,000 provided in the first round of funding for lighting and landscaping works at the magnificent Myimbarr Community Park, which was officially opened by me and the council’s administrator, Mr David Jesson, on 16 December 2009.

        is the recipient of $230,000 from the Jobs Fund, which will help to complete new facilities in a well-patronised community centre. That totals around $4 million worth of investment in infrastructure for the Shellharbour area. This infrastructure will stand the test of time and add to community amenity whilst sustaining and stimulating local employment.

        I want to place on the record my thanks to Minister Albanese for his visit to our region in March last year and for his ongoing interest in progressing the projects I have talked about this morning. In addition, the residents of
