        Elwood is so nice that even members of the National Party like to go there! On the weekend I spent time at a number of different community events at Elwood. On Saturday afternoon I attended the 'Heat, Fire and Flood' event at the

        at Elwood secondary school, put on by the Port Phillip Emergency Climate Action Network. It was a wonderful gathering, a full house—a packed house—at the Phoenix Theatre in Elwood, put on and chaired by the force of Jack Halliday. One of the speakers,

        The weekend was topped off with a wonderful Sunday afternoon in Elwood, at the Elwood Toy Library where we had the Messy Play Day. There were a number of families there, including my own. We brought my beautiful daughter and my nephew to come and play with all of the messy toys at the Elwood Toy Library. It was a wonderful weekend and I encourage everyone to come and visit all the things that make Elwood wonderful.
