        Today I rise to congratulate a particular service in my electorate. I congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA" rel="nofollow">
         PISA
        </a>
        Italian Meals and Services on the opening of their new meals kitchen in the suburb of Torrensville, which happened at the end of last year. PISA is an acronym for Pasti Italiani e Servizi per Anziani, which means 'Italian food service' for the Italian community in the western suburbs. PISA's vision is to be a provider of meals to many elderly people, to those who are disabled and to many others who, for whatever reason, cannot get their own mealsâ€”and also, very importantly, a point of contact for the community to enhance their lifestyle choices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The electorate of Hindmarsh has a very large Italian community, many of whom are now getting to the ages of the late 70s, 80s or 90s. Many of them came over in the 1950s or 1960s as young men and women in their late teens or early 20s, and today they are one of the fastest-ageing populations in my electorate. I think this service will be a huge success for them and is much needed. My electorate is one of the oldest, so we are having many, many ageing issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the new kitchen was built, all meals for PISA were cooked in the Firle kitchen, which is on the other side of Adelaide, meaning a long drive for those many volunteers to come down to the western suburbs to deliver their meals to the houses of the clients. Logistically, it was a challenge to keep food at the right temperature et cetera. The new kitchen is located in the heart of Torrensville, in the heart of the Italian community in the western suburbs. It also doubles as a shopfront where you can pop in for a coffee or pick up a beautiful ready-made meal. I can tell you that the meals are pretty good, and so is the coffee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to attend the opening with some of my state parliamentary colleagues, including the Minister for

        ; Minister Grace Portolesi; and Minister Tom Koutsantonis. It was at the end of last year. It was an absolutely packed house, and no wonder, because the feedback I get back about PISA is absolutely excellent. We were all very impressed with the new kitchen and with the services that PISA will now be able to provide to the residents living in those western suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        As someone whose own parents are from a non-English-speaking background, I am very acutely aware of the importance of culturally appropriate aged-care services. That is why I am really pleased that we here in the Australian government helped to fund this new kitchen through our Home and Community Care package, because it will make a huge difference, especially in the quality of life of many, many constituents. I must extend special thanks and congratulations to the

        of PISA, Kelley Russo, and Grace Ciccone, the president, who worked very hard to get the kitchen up.
