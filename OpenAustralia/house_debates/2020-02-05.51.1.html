        I rise to honour the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        honours recipients for 2020. In my wonderful electorate of Higgins there are many very worthy recipients. I'm pleased to say that a number of women have been honoured this Australia Day. Professor Rachelle Buchbinder AO was honoured for distinguished service to medical education in the fields of epidemiology and rheumatology and to professional associations. Rachelle, who is based locally at the Cabrini hospital, the only hospital in Higgins, is a rheumatologist who has worked to help thousands of patients with back pain. She has encouraged patients and doctors to move away from addictive opioids and surgery that can be dangerous and focus more on losing weight and staying active as a treatment for lower back pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Erica Frydenberg AM was honoured for significant service to psychology. Dr Frydenberg is not only a neighbour of mine but the mother of our federal Treasurer,

        . Her work over a 50-year career has developed key psychological tests to assess adolescent resilience and adult coping. It is such important work. The former executive director of the Australian Psychological Society Lyn Littlefield honoured Dr Frydenberg for her work, acknowledging her reputation in research and clinical excellence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Lenore Manderson AM was acknowledged for her service to education, particularly medical anthropology, and to public health.

        These are fantastic women. This year, 41 per cent of Australia Day honours went to women. I'd like to see more of that. Congratulations!
