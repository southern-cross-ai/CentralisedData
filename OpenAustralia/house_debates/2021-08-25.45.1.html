        In 2010, young
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_White" rel="nofollow">
         Sam White
        </a>
        was living with his parents, Jim and Andrea, in Whyalla. Jim was a senior manager at Arrium. Sadly, he has passed since. But Sam had a motorbike accident at Port Lowly, about 15 kilometres out of the city and, sadly, he was rendered a paraplegic as a result of that accident.

They went back to back in 2014-15, and Sam made his way onto the Rollers team, which is the Australian wheelchair basketball team—our national team—as it went to the Rio Olympics. Two years later he was part of our team at the world championships and tomorrow he will take the boards for the Rollers at the Tokyo Paralympics. Go Sam!
