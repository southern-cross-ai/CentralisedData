       <p>
        I really thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, for your cooperation and indulgence in keeping the adjournment debate going following that division. I want to use my time in this speech to join with the Prime Minister and other members of the parliament in offering my condolences to the families and people of Greymouth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        , in the wake of the disaster at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        mine.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know this is something that is very much on the minds of people in my electorate, being one of the major coalmining regions of Australia. The unfolding tragedy of the past five days would have had very strong resonance within the households, workplaces and communities of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
         Bowen Basin
        </a>
        and of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        more generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst our hearts have gone out to the people affected in New Zealand, the tragedy could not have helped but stir memories for many families and people of towns like Moura and Collinsville, in particular, but also in Central Queensland who have been touched by their own workplace tragedies associated with the mining industry over the years that it has been a big part of our economy and activity in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        About an hour or so ago I made a phone call to a woman, with whom I work quite closely, in the town of Moranbah, without realising that her husband is part of the mines rescue team in the Bowen Basin. He is in fact, almost as we speak, flying over with another workmate to New Zealand to be part of the rescue operation over there. There are people in my electorate who are personally involved and for them the danger is not yet over. His wife said to me that, as soon as the all-clear is given to go anywhere near the mine to retrieve the deceased miners, her husband will be the first one going in there. My thoughts are with those people in my electorate who are so closely involved in this matter. I am very conscious that the danger is not yet over for them. I wish them all the best in assisting that community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things about mining communities is that there is a very strong bond between miners and their families which crosses all borders and boundaries. So the thoughts of people in my electorate will be very much with the other people of Greymouth and with the families of those killed at the Pike River Mine.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke, when you were in the chair a couple of weeks ago, about the additional burden of danger that is being placed on too many of our miners. I am talking about the increasing reliance that mining companies are placing on their employeesâ€”I guess fly-in fly-out is the overarching term, but it is the drive-in drive-out practice that is becoming more widespread in the Bowen Basin. That is adding an extra burden of worry and danger on miners and their families as they are not only working very long hours in what is a dangerous industry but then compounding that by having to drive long distances backwards and forwards to their families, mostly located on the coast. I really support the communities in my electorate which are taking a stand and trying to hold the line against that overreliance on drive-in drive-out or fly-in fly-out practices. These are strong communities, they are good communities and they need to be building off the back of this boom rather than seeing it pass them by.
       </p>
       <p>
        One young man I do want to mention, in the closing minutes of this debate, who lost his life less than a month ago is Scott Ramage. Scott was a great young bloke from Collinsville who was working in Moranbah. He lost his life just a few weeks ago on the road between Moranbah and Collinsville. My thoughts remain with his family, his dad, Peter, his wife, Kirby, and his young boys. I know that their grief is far from over.
