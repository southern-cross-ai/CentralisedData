        I rise today to speak in support of the Logan community. Over the past few weeks, there has been plenty of media coverage about the events in Logan several weeks ago. But I would like to remind those in this House and the broader Australian community that on any given day in Logan there are many positive events happening that do not get this kind of attention, and I would like to focus on a couple of those today.

        Earlier this year, CentroCARE opened in Beenleigh, providing food parcels, clothing, care and support for the people in our community. Since opening, CentroCARE has supported people through the recent floods and helped out many others in need around our community.

        In other news, a local mother, Stephanie Azri from Shailer Park, has developed a book to help children keep a healthy mindset. Stephanie wrote a program which was trialled in a local school and, due to its success, she decided to publish it, making the program available to children to help teach resilience and positive thinking; and to help young people deal with self-esteem, anxiety and stress, grief and loss, relationships and healthy bodies.

        These are just a couple of the many examples of the good stuff that is going on in Logan community on any given day.
