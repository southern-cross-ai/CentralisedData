        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. Following on from the minister's statement to the House today on industry and manufacturing, will the minister outline how the Morrison government's investment in national manufacturing priorities will create a stronger manufacturing sector to create jobs and new economic opportunities?

         I thank the member for his question. I was delighted this morning to deliver the ministerial statement on industry and manufacturing and set out the very clear vision that this government has for industry, specifically manufacturing, in this nation, because our manufacturers in Australia are ready to take on the world and we are backing them, absolutely, to be able to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our strategy for manufacturing is based on building competitiveness, building resilience and building scale. But, before we did that, we had to make sure that we were putting in place the very strong economic foundation that was needed and that would support all of industry, all of businesses and all of manufacturing. That includes the instant asset write-off. It includes the work the minister for energy is doing on gas. It includes the work that is being done on deregulation. That is the very strong economic base on which the $1.5 billion manufacturing strategy is built.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have been very clear about is that we have acknowledged that we cannot be all things to all people. What we have to do is name some pretty clear priorities, some national manufacturing priorities, where we have either a competitive or a comparative advantage or we need to build that capability because of the strategic priorities of this nation. The six national priorities that we have named are: resources, technology and critical minerals processing; food and beverage; medical products; recycling and clean energy; and defence and space. We are backing those key priority sectors so that we can build the scale that we need.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that those opposites are focusing their manufacturing strategy on trains. Frankly, that is the only platform they have for manufacturing. They have no idea. They do not understand what manufacturing in this nation is all about. We on this side of the House understand it and we are backing Australian manufacturers every single day. Australian manufacturers can rely on this government because we understand what they're about. We are building them. We are going to make small businesses medium enterprises. We are going to build our medium enterprises into large businesses. We won't turn our back on them. We will put our money into developing those key strategies and we will make sure that we are delivering the jobs that are needed now and for the future.
