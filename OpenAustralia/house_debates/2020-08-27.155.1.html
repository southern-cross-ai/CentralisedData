        I'd like to highlight today the fantastic work being done by the

        , and school principal, Kristine Pizzaro, are changing lives with the program they've created there. They have increased attendance dramatically, improved academic results and empowered the young men in the program. Luke Walker, whose brother Cody plays for the Rabbitohs, told me that before the academy program started, some of the boys were at school once or twice a week. Now the same boys are waiting at the front of their house at 6 am for a bus to get to their footy training session, and then get ready for school. I'd like to congratulate last year's graduates, Sebastian Knox and Zac Mason. Graduating this year are Damon Kirby, Isaiah Thornton, Blade Blackadder,

        and Jarrod Chalker. And the current year 11s who will graduate next year are Liam Godwin, Oscar Knight, Koby Cook, Jamal Laurie, Josh Seaton and Kaylan King. Congratulations to everyone involved at this South Grafton High School on a fantastic program.

        I would like to recognise 18-year-old Anika Learoyd, a rising cricket star in my community. Anika grew up at Corindi and has just signed her first major cricket contract with the Sydney Thunder. It has been a very big year for Anika, who has also been selected as part of the

        I'd like to acknowledge the Seaview Tavern in Woolgoolga. They have just been named in the top 10 per cent of hospitality businesses worldwide by Tripadvisor, an exceptionally exciting achievement for a locally owned business. It's awarded by looking at the hundreds of reviews that are left by customers. They were also awarded a Tripadvisor 2020 Travellers' Choice Award. I want to congratulate the management staff: Mark Mihai, the managing director;

         The time for three-minute constituency statements has expired, but traditionally we get the leave of the House to continue for another 30 minutes. So, if there's no objection, we will continue for another 30 minutes.
