        (—) (): Last week I had the privilege of attending the opening of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Independence" rel="nofollow">
         Project Independence
        </a>
        's newest complex in Phillip. The work Project Independence is doing in Canberra represents a new dawn for how we treat those living with an intellectual disability, and the key is in the project's name: independence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day was a long time coming. Twice disrupted by the pandemic, what was originally a six-month project in 2019 turned into an epic build that has taken almost four years. The first sod was turned right back in August 2019. Then COVID hit and the project was put on hold. It was also delayed by supply issues, construction costs increasing and even the theft of all the dishwashers dropped off to the site for installation in the units. But, despite these setbacks, the residents have now started their journey to homeownership as they move into the units in the Phillip development.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project will see 10 people with intellectual disabilities, with an average age of 29, move into the new units in Phillip. Up until now, nine had been living at home with their families. They now have safe and secure housing and the opportunity to own their own home, with a portion of their disability support pension going towards ongoing costs and an equity share of the property. One of the new residents in Project Independence's Phillip project is 24-year-old Remy, who has been living at home with his parents, Gayle and Bud, in Wanniassa. Remy, a visitor concierge officer right here at

       </p>
       <p>
        Homeownership rates for young people with intellectual disability are amongst the lowest in Australia. The Phillip homes were the third residential scheme opened in Canberra by Project Independence, a not-for-profit enterprise that provides homeownership for people with intellectual disability. Created as a social business, Project Independence aims to provide people with an intellectual disability with a pathway to achieving ownership of a property through ownership of a company share. Project Independence's unique model works in a way that makes sure that people with an intellectual disability who are living out of home for the first time are fully supported while learning essential life skills but are then given the opportunity to grow their independence through buying their own home further down the track, without derailing their financial capacity. As a social business, Project Independence aims to engage with other like-minded organisations, such as governments, businesses and not-for-profit organisations, to develop future housing options for the intellectually disabled, as long as they meet the other objectives of the organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Project Independence is an organisation grounded in values that aim to provide a place of safety for residents to grow their independence both financially and socially, with guidance and support, while living within a sustainable, safe and caring community that ensures residents are entitled to a lifestyle that is based on the same rights and opportunities as other citizens have in a shared living environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the board of directors behind Project Independence, including Glenn Keys, the co-founder and managing director of Canberra based Aspen Medical, one of the world's leading providers of outsourced healthcare solutions. Glenn's son, Ehren, who has Down syndrome, is a driver for Glenn's passion for the disability community. Serving with Glenn on the board are

       </p>
       <p>
        Another three developers have committed to three further Project Independence projects in Canberra, which will add to much-needed supply in Canberra, where 57 people are waiting for their opportunity for independent living. Project Independence is giving hope to Australians living with an intellectual disability. It's projects like this that are a testament to corporate social responsibility.

It's a thriving year 7 to year 12 school with a social justice heartbeat that has taught thousands of Canberrans every year, from Genesis Owusu and Nick Cotric to Eamon and Stella Smith. Congratulations, MacKillop, on 25 years. May there be another 25 years coming just around the corner.
