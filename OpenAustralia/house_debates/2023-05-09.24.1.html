       <p>
        Much of the focus today is, understandably, on the budget, but I want to acknowledge the extraordinary stress and emotional turmoil that families of Sudanese heritage everywhere, including in my electorate, are experiencing.

       <p>
        A resilient people, they give back to this nation in so many ways. Take Mohamed Semra, who arrived here as a six-year-old with his mother and siblings after years in a refugee camp. Now 24, Mohamed is the co-founder of a social enterprise, Endeavour Youth Australia, which works in school to stamp out racism and develop the leaders of the future. His two brothers, both Australian citizens, remain trapped in Sudan. His sister-in-law is nine months pregnant and can't travel. The situation remains volatile and dangerous. Australia is deeply concerned by reports that more than 550 people have been killed and almost 5,000 injured since fighting began in Sudan on 15 April. Australia continues to work closely with international partners to evacuate Australians; some 237 Australians and their families have left Sudan. Huge efforts are also underway to provide humanitarian support. Of the $6 million in support recently announced, $1 million is for the

        </a>
        of the Red Cross to provide medical supplies, food, water and emergency shelter. Australia continues to call on all parties to agree to a permanent cessation of hostilities. In the meantime, our thoughts remain with the Sudanese community.
