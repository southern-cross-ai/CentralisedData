        I had the opportunity to have a work experience student from the Learn Earn Legend program in my parliamentary office. Benita McGinty is a young student living in Forrestfield in my electorate. Benita comes from

        in the Kimberly region. She is a young Aboriginal woman who is of Walmajarri and Gija Descent. She spent her childhood with her grandmother learning her language and culture. She moved to Perth in 2008 for high school. She is now in year 12 and doing a traineeship with Monadelphous completing a certificate

        in business. She is studying at

        and is working hard to create strong future for herself.

        Benita tells me that she would like a career on a mine site with a trade or to be working to build a strong local community. Benita believes that her time in parliament this week has been an eye-opener and an experience that she will not forget. She was interested to learn how new laws were being developed and new bills were brought into the parliament. Benita said that she is very happy and proud of herself to be able to come all the way to Canberra and meet Aboriginal students from across Australia from the Learn Earn Legend program and meet and see members of the parliament. I wish Benita the very best for her future and I hope this week was indeed an experience she will not forget.
