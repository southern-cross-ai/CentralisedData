          McEwen
         </a>
         for his question. The decision by the member for Cook to appoint himself to administer five additional portfolios without telling the Australian people—and, in the case of four of the portfolios, without even telling the relevant minister—fundamentally undermines the principles of responsible government that are reflected in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Constitution
         </a>
         . And, even worse, this is what the Solicitor-General concluded about this behaviour: 'An unpublicised appointment to administer a department fundamentally undermines not just the proper functioning of responsible government but also the relationship between the ministry and the Public Service.'

            goes into great detail about the sub judice convention. It makes clear that it goes nowhere near an inquiry of this nature. The question was in order, as you ruled, and it's very clear there's not even an objection being made that in any way the minister was being anything other than relevant to the question he was asked.

              I will repeat: few are in any doubt that the former Prime Minister's conduct was indefensible. The shadow minister for home affairs even called on him to leave the parliament. But there are still many questions that remain unanswered, and that is why the inquiry that the Prime Minister announced with me on 26 August is necessary. What precisely were the facts and circumstances surrounding these secret appointments? The only account we've had is a self-pitying, self-serving and self-justifying account by the member for Cook, who appears to remain pathologically incapable of accepting responsibility for his own behaviour, let alone showing genuine contrition. What precisely were the implications arising from these appointments on, for example, the functioning of relevant departments and statutory bodies or on the accountability of the executive to the parliament, and what steps can the current government take to make sure that this never happens again?

              This sorry saga does speak poorly to the culture of cover-up and secrecy inside the former coalition government. Most Australians were well aware of the former coalition government's addiction to cover-up and secrecy, but what this particular scandal tells us is that the culture of cover-up and secrecy inside the former government was so insidious and so corrosive that senior ministers, including the Prime Minister, couldn't even keep each other informed about significant—

The sub judice convention in particular applies, the House has previously found, when you're dealing with something in the order of a jury trial, where there is a sense that what is said in parliament could have an implication for the justice that is then shown. To think in any way that debate in this parliament over the behaviour of the former government would have an impact on a former High Court judge in that way is something that the convention goes nowhere near.

                    I'd repeat: the culture of cover-up and secrecy inside the former government was so insidious that senior ministers could not even keep each other informed about significant matters, even if they were concealing matters that went to the proper functioning of responsible government.
