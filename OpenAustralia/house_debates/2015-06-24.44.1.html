        Last weekend we saw a celebration of Gilmore youth. On Friday I had the privilege of opening the new Southern Youth Community Hub in Warilla. Narelle Clay, the dynamo champion of disadvantaged youth, had achieved a long-term goal with the opening of this facility, which will be of enormous benefit to young people in the region. Narelle's energy combined with the advocacy of my parliamentary colleagues,

        and

        , plus the vision of the coalition government in allocating more than $2.5 million for the hub has produced an outstanding achievement.

        On Friday night Amy Evison's dance students shone at their half-yearly concert in the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre. The cadets of

        were on inspection parade on Saturday morning. I congratulate Leading Seamen Kyle Douglas and Harmony Brown, and also Leading Seaman Natasha Cook, who joins the Navy next week. Petty officers Kimberley Cotterill and Glen Matheson were terrific. It was an impressive display and one I never tire of being able to attend.

        The stars of the Shoalhaven Eisteddfod were really shining on Saturday afternoon where dance, instrumental and speaking acts were all showcased. That night the members of the Shellharbour Surf Lifesaving Club were honoured. Many youngsters gained awards for surf rescue, surf bronze medals, and more than 67 members gained recognition for 100 per cent in surf patrol duty. These were all great contributions by youth in our community. Their talents and diverse interests are an asset for Gilmore. I am honoured to recognise them all today.
