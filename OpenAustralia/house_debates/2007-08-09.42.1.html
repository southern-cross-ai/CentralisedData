        My question is to the Minister for Ageing—who seems to be ageing in place down here. My question relates to the National Seniors Australia launch of its election priorities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        yesterday. The minister would be aware that one of the concerns raised was the limited implementation of the government’s National Oral Health Plan. Could the minister inform ageing Australians of the measures he intends to take in terms of oral health care?

         I thank the member for New England for his question. I think his question could properly have been put to the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Health and Ageing
         </a>
         , because it is a question about dental health. I would refer him to the budget announcements about dental health, which were generous and important and linked the Commonwealth government’s role with respect to dental health for older Australians—with a commitment of, I think, over $380 million specifically for dental health—to chronic illnesses associated with dental health.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         government has, through the PBS, the Medicare benefits schedule and through this particular commitment and program in the budget announced this year, specifically catered for senior Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is just one of the areas in which the Commonwealth government, led by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         , have put seniors front in centre in our policy. I am very proud to be the Minister for Ageing, following on from a number of ministers over the last 11 years who have increased the spending on aged care from $3.1 billion in 1996 to $10.1 billion by 2010; increased support for respite for carers of older Australians from a measly $18 million in 1996 to $184 million this year—and an extra $41 million was announced in this year’s budget for respite; increased the number of community aged-care packages from 4,500 in 1996 to over 45,000 in the present day; and increased the places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over from a measly 93 in 1996 to 108 today.

          Order! I remind the Minister for Ageing that he should refer to the Prime Minister by his title.
