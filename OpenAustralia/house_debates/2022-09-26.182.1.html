       <p>
        The cost-of-living crisis is hitting hard and it is especially felt by renters. In my home electorate of Brisbane, 53.5 per cent of dwellings were rented at the time of the most recent census. In the June quarter of this year, the vacancy rate in Brisbane dropped to 0.7 per cent. That is a lot of renters with very, very few options on where to rent. Low vacancy rates have been coupled with massive increases in weekly rents. In the last 18 months, the average weekly rent for a two-bedroom home has increased by almost 20 per cent in Brisbane. A one-bedroom apartment is up 15.5 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        These rental increases aren't just numbers, though; they're people. One of my constituents, Dominica, is facing an uncertain future for her and her daughter, as she must contend with unsustainable rent increases and a near-zero vacancy rate. Susie and Bella are two young workers in Brisbane who have had to offer far more than the listed rent price for every single rental application they have submitted, to even remotely be considered.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just two stories from the countless messages our office has received from renters and families in distress. It is time to freeze rents. This will provide immediate cost-of-living relief and economic security to millions of renters across the country, particularly people in my electorate of Brisbane. We cannot expect charities and community organisations to bear the entire brunt of the housing crisis. The government has a responsibility to step in and have people's backs.
