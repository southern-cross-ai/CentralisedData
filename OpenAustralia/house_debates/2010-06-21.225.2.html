        I am pleased to speak on this motion in recognition of the sinking of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Maru" rel="nofollow">
          Montevideo Maru
         </a>
        </i>
        on 1 July 1942. The story of how so many Australians died on board the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        , despite it being our nation’s most horrific maritime disaster, is little known. This Japanese transport freighter was carrying over 1,000 military prisoners of war and civilians. Over 800 Australian soldiers and 206 civilians were believed to be locked in the ship’s hold when she sank. No Australian survived—the biggest single loss of life in our nation’s wartime history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of those who died were members of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Lark Force
        </a>
        . Lark Force comprised the 2nd/22nd Battalion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIF" rel="nofollow">
         AIF
        </a>
        and supporting units, 1,400 soldiers in total. The 2nd/22nd Battalion, which formed the nucleus of Lark Force, was originally based at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Martha" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Martha
        </a>
        , on the Victorian peninsula. The majority of these men came from Victoria, from rural and metropolitan areas. The force arrived in the island on 26 April, tasked with protecting the airfields and seaplane base at Rabaul. The force was ill equipped and was vulnerable to Japanese attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Japanese began bombing in January 1942, and by the morning of 23 January Lark Force commander Colonel John Scanlan ordered a withdrawal from Rabaul, stating that it was ‘every man for himself’. Of these Australian troops, around 400 escaped and returned to Australia. Of the remaining troops, over 800 became prisoners of war and 160 were massacred at Tol Plantation. Those remaining members of Lark Force were taken prisoner by the advancing Japanese army and were placed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW" rel="nofollow">
         POW
        </a>
        camps in Papua
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        . Australian and European civilians who were living and working in Rabaul at the time were also taken prisoner by the Japanese army and placed in the POW camps.
       </p>
       <p>
        In late June 1942, the troops and civilians were taken to the port city of Rabaul, where they were boarded onto the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        , which was scheduled to carry them to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Hainan Island
        </a>
        , in China, which was occupied by the Japanese at the time. En route to Hainan Island, the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        was intercepted by the American submarine the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS" rel="nofollow">
         USS
        </a>
        <i>
         Sturgeon
        </i>
        . Unaware that there were Australian POWs on board, the USS
        <i>
         Sturgeon
        </i>
        torpedoed the ship at 2.29 am. Eleven minutes later, the ship sank. It is thought that most drowned where they were imprisoned in the hull of the ship as it took on water.

        today with his two daughters. Of the Australian civilians to have died in the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        , one was Walter James Ryan. Walter had moved to the island in 1931 to work for a local trading company. Walter was due for long-service leave in December 1941 but decided to hold off while his wife, Frances, moved to Sydney to settle the children into schooling. Walter was looking forward to following later in 1942 but he did not return home. Walter’s daughter Julia Richardson lives in my own electorate. She has said, like so many of the men and women who are here today, that their life was put on hold for over three years while they waited for the hope of news of their father.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of this tragedy was felt by people right across our country. Loved ones and relatives of those Australians killed have carried the unbearable and unimaginable burden of losing a loved one at war. Amongst these mourners are members and former members of this House. I respectfully acknowledge the loss of Reverend Syd Beazley, the Hon.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Garrett" rel="nofollow">

        , both of whom were on board the
        <i>

        </i>
        on that fateful morning.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of my contribution, I would like to read some words that Kim Beazley has sent specifically for this evening:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Families of those who lost relatives and loved ones in this our greatest loss at sea would be deeply grateful for recognition of their sadness and pride. Most of us left now are too young to have known the fallen but they live richly in our family legend. Australians are good at somberly recognising the sacrifice of their fellows. Opening the nations arms through the Parliament to embrace the dear lost of the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        is part of a fine tradition. The relatives of Syd Beazley—
       </p>
       <p>
        and, I am sure, many of those here today—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        would be warmed by this embrace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story of the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        will live in our nation’s history. It is remembered on the national prisoners of war memorial in Ballarat and on other memorials across Australia and internationally. In this parliament, I formally acknowledge those who died on the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        and I pay my respects to their families and their friends who are present with us today.

         It is indeed a privilege to rise this evening, on behalf of the coalition, to add the support of members on all sides of the chamber to the motion that has been put forward by the member for Ballarat and which has been spoken of today—principally, of course, to recognise the sacrifice of those Australian servicemen who lost their lives aboard the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Maru" rel="nofollow">
           Montevideo Maru
          </a>
         </i>
         some 68 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         As someone with involvement in the Montevideo Maru Foundation since my election in 2001, I want to pay particular tribute to Cynthia Schmidt and James Kennett who I know worked alongside so many others, all of whom have been tireless advocates of the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         and the need for recognition of Australia’s worst maritime disaster. Of what has been the worst maritime disaster there is still too little known. I know from the time that I have spent speaking face-to-face with people like Cynthia of the genuine grief and the need to have closure through a definitive answer to questions that have lingered for far too long.
        </p>
        <p>
         The facts of the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         the capture of the Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Lark Force
         </a>
         personnel and the civilian interns, as well as what we know about the circumstances of the ship’s sinking—have been, today, relatively well documented, both in the House and by the member. But it stands in contrast to the history—that for so long so many people had no real clarity about the circumstances that took place.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I want to talk about today—and I am mindful of the presence in the public galleries of survivors, of relatives, of family and friends—is the need for closure and the need for certainty for so many Australians who lost family members either on the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         or in the days before the ship set sail. In the past I have sponsored petitions in this place calling for the government to conduct an inquiry, and for a search for the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         . It is important to acknowledge that not everyone is of the same view with respect to the relevance of that. But I have been persuaded over the years that an inquiry, and looking into the feasibility of a search, is the direction in which we should go to help to provide closure for those who still question who was on board and who was not.
        </p>
        <p>
         In many respects, today is just a start. The formal recognition by this nation’s parliament is something that has been well overdue for too long. But it is just another step on the journey. I know, from having had the opportunity just this afternoon to speak with family members, that there is still a great desire for more to be done. That is why I was pleased that both the government and the opposition committed $100,000 today towards an ongoing search, as part of an ongoing commitment to bringing closure to the families involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         On this important occasion, when the families of victims have travelled from around Australia to be in the House of Representatives today, I want to renew that call for closure. For Australia’s worst maritime disaster and following the joy of finding the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Ship" rel="nofollow">
          Hospital Ship
         </a>
         <i>
          Centaur
         </i>
         , I believe that we as a nation should expect nothing less. I also think we should give consideration to a national day of remembrance to be celebrated on 23 January—the anniversary of the fall of Rabaul,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain" rel="nofollow">
          New Britain
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Ireland" rel="nofollow">
          New Ireland
         </a>
         and the surrounding islands of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          New Guinea
         </a>
         . The reality is that, despite this being Australia’s worst maritime disaster, there is not enough public awareness of the ultimate sacrifice made by more than 1,000 Australians in this incident. Though most Australians know of the HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and the search for the
         <i>
          Centaur
         </i>
         , fewer Australians would know anything about the tragedy of the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         . It is my sincere hope that today will represent a turning point in the ongoing story of the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to place on the record my profound respect and admiration for the Australian men and women who gave their lives in this horrible disaster. Though not a lot, and certainly not enough, is known about their fate, we can be certain of their bravery and sacrifice in the defence of our nation. I have no doubt that all the people in the gallery today and all of those who read of this in subsequent days will stand proud of the fact that that sacrifice was not for naught but for our nation.
