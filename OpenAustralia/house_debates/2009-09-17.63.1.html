         Order! The member for Canning will resume his seat. People want to try to control what is happening here by interjection. For several seconds there was only one person seeking the call, and that was the member for Canning. The member for Canning has the call.

          installer paid $6,000 for 100 packs of 20 insulation batts last month. This month he paid $5,240 for 50 packs of 10 batts. That is a price hike of four times the cost of the original unit—costs that are being passed on to the Australian taxpayer. Will the minister explain to the house how a quadrupling of the pink batts price represents value for money?

           I thank the member for his question and I am happy to take on notice that particular matter that he refers to, see whether there is additional information in relation to the views that he has put to me about that, come back to the House and report to them. But I make that response in the context of issues that have been raised by the opposition previously, including that by the member for Hinkler which I referred to in question time yesterday. We found that, on examining the view of the company in question that the member purported to represent here in the parliament, in actual fact the claims that the member made in the parliament were false.

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister has conceded that he has completed the answer to the direct question. There is a process of the House to add to an answer. He can make use of that if he wants to do what he is trying to do now.

              I make the point to the House that since the inception of this program two things have happened. The first is that we have had a record number of ceiling insulations take place in a record short period of time. This was for a program that those opposite opposed. The second thing is that we have put in place a range of compliance and auditing measures in order to make sure that the taxpayer gets very good value for this program that the government is delivering. Let us remember that we are delivering a program that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, that employs Australians, that puts ceiling insulation in the roof to enable Australians to lower their energy costs and—

                 <p>
                  I simply make the point that one listens carefully to the questions that are put by the opposition and to the views that are put by the opposition, and when it comes to some members of the opposition—in particular the member for Flinders, who said that this program was falling apart at the seams when we had 290,000 installations—I think it is time to put these questions in context. But we will take seriously the question that the member has put. I will come back to the House. I make this final point. If we are serious about addressing climate change—as we are on this side of the House—then the Energy Efficient Homes Program, which has only 0.3 per cent of actual issues that have been raised on a program that up to this point in time has been phenomenally successful in its deployment, is doing the job that it was required to do.
