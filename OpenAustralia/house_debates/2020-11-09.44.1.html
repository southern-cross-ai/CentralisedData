        Although restrictions are lifting, the lasting effects of the COVID crisis continue for many as they face an uncertain future. That is why the Morrison government is rolling out a COVID-19 mental health campaign—'How's your head today?'—to urge people to prioritise their mental health, raise awareness about how to identify when something is wrong and encourage people to seek help. The campaign will be launched on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        and radio and in shopping centres and venues online and through social media, and will continue into next year.

        The message is simple but effective. With the world turned on its head, many of us aren't feeling like ourselves. But what happens in your head doesn't have to stay there. There are things we can do to feel better, like staying connected, keeping busy and being active. How's your head today?
