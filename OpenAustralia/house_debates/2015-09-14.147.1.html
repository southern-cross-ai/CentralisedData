        Gilmore is always a place to gloat about and last Friday was no exception. The day began at the Navy base

        Albatross to turn the first sod. At least, this was a symbolic gesture. I almost thought I would have a chance to operate a bulldozer as the site is well and truly in its construction phase. The Minister for Defence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Andrews" rel="nofollow">

        , was unable to attend so I was able to represent him to turn the sod as a confirmation of the government's $157 million investment in the Helicopter Aircrew Training System. This brings the total investment in our local defence region to a level of more than $6.2 billion. This level of training infrastructure, simulators and accommodation brings this base to a position of being one of the best in the world. The community is proud and the Navy and Army helicopter training school is proud. Special mention of our great Navy personnel Commodore Vince Di Pietro, Commodore Colin Lawrence, Captain Simon Bateman and Captain Steve Hussey should be made. A more personable and professional group I could not ever find. Thank you also to Group Captain Browning and Lieutenant Colonel Hamlyn, who ably represented the full integration of all our services. I could not be more proud myself.

        That afternoon, Gilmore shone in two other ways. Karen Anstiss, an energetic and never-give-up woman, had the formal opening of her Work for the Dole inclusive workplace, The Collared Box. Just eight weeks ago she had the brainchild of having an up-market op shop. She worked with local landlords and secured premises with the generosity of reduced rent from one of them. Her husband, David—always a steadfast ally—helped create clean and well-lit space. Trent Mills, from her Terara Farm venture, and

        -Little, who turned recycled timber into furniture pieces, created the fit-out as well as producing goods that were able to be sold and which were a major drawcard. Mel Busby, who also works occasionally at Flagstaff, will be helping. It is a truly inclusive employment space. Already there are Work for the Dole managers helping in the retail space and learning those skills in this not-for-profit venture. Congratulations to Karen and her daughters Molly, Kia and Roz, who have all pitched in to make this amazing venture fantastically successful.

        Finally that afternoon we held our inaugural Syrian refugee resettlement strategy meeting. Around 30 group representatives and individuals came to my office to ask questions and give offers of assistance to help the people settle into our community. Their compassion, enthusiasm and fair dinkum wish to help is heart-warming. Thanks to the Culey family, the Kettlewell family, Mel Hybinett, Margie Jirgens, Sally Vidler, Roger Tilly, Ryan Heard, Kylie Farrer,
