         thank the honourable member for Gwydir and acknowledge his deep interest in this issue over a long period of time. No Australian would be pleased to see the reports of violence in Aboriginal communities or the level of violence in Aboriginal communities which appears to be occurring at present. This is a problem—

         <p>
          This is a serious issue, and I hope that the opposition will take it seriously, because I believe people of goodwill on all sides of Australian politics will want to see a situation where those who live in Aboriginal communities are safe—safe from rape and child abuse—and will want to see a situation where those people who perpetrate violence against others in those communities are brought to justice, prosecuted and punished.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Mal Brough, has recently been on a tour of some of these communities to see for himself the level of abuse and violence. I want to pay tribute to him for the way in which he has taken on this issue so forcefully and thoughtfully.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government believes that there is no substitute for law enforcement in Aboriginal communities. The government believes that there is no such thing as a cultural defence for rape or child molestation. The government believes that, whatever the colour of a child’s skin, it deserves a safe life; and the government believes that, whatever the colour of the skin of a perpetrator, that perpetrator must be brought to justice. The federal government pledges every support to the Northern Territory government and its police force in relation to bringing to justice those people who are reasonably suspected of crime, ensuring that they are processed by the courts and punished.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          government stands ready to lend any assistance to the Northern Territory government to ensure that that policing function can be properly discharged.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yesterday I wrote to all of the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories to invite them to a summit on violence and child abuse called by Minister Mal Brough, the minister responsible for Indigenous affairs. I urge all premiers and chief ministers, including the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
           Chief Minister
          </a>
          of the Northern Territory, to attend. The aim of the summit will be to develop a concrete set of actions to improve law and order in Indigenous communities, to strengthen policing of laws that protect children against abuse and to ensure that support is given to those who report and give evidence. It is important that witnesses and those who give evidence feel safe about doing so if the perpetrators are to be brought to justice.
         </p>
         <p>
          In June 2004
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
           COAG
          </a>
          approved a national framework on Indigenous family violence and child protection and agreed that further work would proceed through bilateral agreements between the Australian government and each jurisdiction. Whilst this has produced some useful outcomes, many important issues remain. I would urge each of the premiers and chief ministers to attend the summit. I say again that the federal government stands ready to assist them in the business of policing and law enforcement.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          indicate, I hope on behalf of both sides of this parliament, that the people of Australia would want us to take a strong stand in relation to safety in Aboriginal communities, and this government will ensure that we do.
