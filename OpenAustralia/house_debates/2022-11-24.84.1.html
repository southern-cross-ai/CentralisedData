        I'd like to acknowledge Lisa Munro from the Casino Rural Fire Brigade. Lisa has been named a life member of the brigade after 27 years of service. She is only the second person to receive this honour. Passionate about firefighting and fire safety, she has also fulfilled roles at the station such as acting captain, communications radio operator and coordinator, brigade secretary, treasurer and call-out officer. During the 2017 Lismore flood, she worked two weeks straight hosing down muddy roads and private property. When she isn't fighting fires, she's providing education about fire safety by visiting schools, preschools, day cares and community events such as Casino Beef Week. She also travels to the

        as part of the New South Wales Rural Fire Brigade's education stall. Congratulations and thank you, Lisa, for all your passionate work in our community.

        I'd like to acknowledge the Grafton and Lismore speedways as they start or have just begun their seasons. Good luck to Grafton Speedway promoters Mick and Cindy Corbett for the season opener this weekend, and also big thanks to

        . They put in many hours during the off-season to ensure the speedway is ready for another season.

        I also give a special shout-out to the Lismore Speedway, which has recently changed hands from

        to the new promoters, Mick and Kim Sauer. The track was severely damaged after the February flooding natural disaster. However, earlier this month, after months of hard work, the season opener attracted some of the biggest crowds ever seen. So congratulations to Mick and Kim and also big thanks to
