        I add my words of support in acknowledging what an important day yesterday was. My question is to the Prime Minister. On Sky News this morning, when asked why
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        was no longer Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence Industry said it was 'because Malcolm Turnbull couldn't sell the government's message'. Is this why the government deposed Malcolm Turnbull and installed the advertising guy as Prime Minister? And given the government's disastrous performance on the weekend, how does he think the muppet show is going?

         The leader of the Labor Party and the deputy leader of the Labor Party seem completely obsessed with the bubble of politics in Canberra. This is where they reside on a daily basis. It's been eight weeks now, and all they can ask questions about is politics. But I will remind them once again of what we've been doing in the last eight weeks. We have concluded the negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement; established the

         into Aged Care Quality and Safety, keeping older Australians safe; toured the drought areas and announced the decision to reduce the red tape for truckies carting hay; increased the payments we've made available for Farm Household Allowance; started construction on Sydney's second airport, with 50 years of talk now over and the project underway; provided more choice for Australian parents, with more funding for non-government schools; moved quickly to establish tougher penalties for food tamperers; legislated a fairer and more sustainable way to distribute the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         ; cut taxes for small and family businesses, accelerating those tax cuts to 25 per cent as those opposite had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do it; and tackled farm labour shortages.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are ensuring that we're focused on the issues that Australians are. Today we have announced further measures to ensure that we will be taking the electricity prices of Australians down by putting in place measures that take the big energy companies to task, and putting in place a big stick—the price guarantees—to ensure Australians can pay less for their electricity, as opposed to paying more and more and more under Labor. There is no surprise that the Labor Party only want to talk about politics, because they have no plans for the future. They want Australians to pay more for everything: higher taxes, higher electricity bills, more for their private health insurance. These are the issues that Australians are focused on; these are the issues our government are focused on. The leader of the Labor Party is just another politician trapped in the Canberra bubble.
