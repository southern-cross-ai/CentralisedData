       <p>
        Back in March, I stood in this place to voice my support for the creation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        's own A-League team. At the time I was not aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Federation_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Football Federation Australia
        </a>
        was well advanced in its plans to deliver upon the dreams of many in our great region. Nearly 10,000 people play the beautiful game in the Chifley electorate alone and I am the proud patron of the mighty Mount Druitt Town Rangers Football Club. Football is in our blood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Thursday I had the huge honour of attending the official launch of the A-League's 'newest, oldest' team: the Western Sydney Wanderers, a side brought together in a mere 186 days, built up from its grassroots via the input of fans. From the colours to the culture to the playing style—all these things have been taken into account and are reflected in the make-up of the Wanderers. Importantly, the Wanderers will provide a critical platform for the region's next generation of young players.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday night the hearts of over 10,000 fans were filled with pride when they saw their team, for the first time, run onto
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Parramatta Stadium
        </a>
        , now dubbed 'The Wanderland.' They took on the

        </a>
        —a tough initiation for a new team—but they acquitted themselves nobly, through a nil-all draw.
       </p>
       <p>
        That the team was built so quickly and comprehensively is an absolute credit to Executive Chairman Lyall Gorman; coaches

       </p>
       <p>
        The two ambitions this humble foundation member has for the club are: firstly, to see them win their first grand final and, secondly, that both sides of politics commit to the construction of a new multipurpose stadium in Western Sydney, one that can become the home of our new A-League team and other sporting events.
