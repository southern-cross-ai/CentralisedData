       <p>
        Local government elections were held in Queensland recently, and I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the local mayors who were re-elected or elected in my region.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the Scenic Room, I congratulate the new mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sharpe" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Sharpe
        </a>
        , on his election. Tom Sharpe defeated the former mayor, Greg Christensen. I'd like to pay tribute to him for his service to our community. I look forward to working with a renewed

        .

        , I'd like to congratulate the hardworking Tanya Milligan on her re-election. Tanya is a wonderful advocate in the region and for the council, and I look forward to continuing my strong relationship with her in the term ahead. In

        </a>
        , local residents voted for a new mayor, with the retirement of Darren Power. I pay tribute to Mayor Power for the significant contribution that he made over many decades. And I take this opportunity to congratulate Jon Raven, who has been elected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">

        , Tom Tait was returned unopposed for his fourth term. I enjoy a strong working relationship with him, along with Glenn Tozer, who was re-elected by our hinterland communities. And in the councils on my borders, Somerset voted in a new mayor, Jason Wendt, and Teresa Harding will return in Ipswich. I look forward to working with both mayors Wendt and Harding.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all those who stood for elections as mayors or councillors across the region, I thank you so much for putting yourselves forward.
