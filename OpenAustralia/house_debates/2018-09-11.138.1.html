        This week is Queensland Disability Action Week. It's a time to raise awareness of issues surrounding disability and empower those living with one. But, above all, this week is a time to celebrate and reflect on the achievements and contributions people living with a disability make to our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Statistics suggest that on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        , where my electorate of Fisher is, there are almost 17,000 people living with a disability. Even more people are touched by disability, from family and friends to carers and health professionals.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , of course, the numbers are much higher, with more than 18 per cent of the population reporting a limitation, restriction or impairment that restricts their everyday activities. I'm the father of a little girl with a disabilityâ€”I shouldn't call her a little girl. She's 16 now. She'd kill me if I said 'a little girl'. She's my baby, so I can get away with it. I have some understanding of the challenges and unique complexities faced by those with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        We as a government have a responsibility to care for those who need our assistance, and I'm proud to play even just a very small part in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        rollout. This year's theme for Disability Action Week is 'Everybody has a role to play'. Madam Deputy Speaker, let me assure you this government is playing its part by delivering the largest disability healthcare reform ever undertaken by the Commonwealth. The NDIS has already overhauled access to disability services, and from 1 January 2019 people on the Sunshine Coast, at Gympie and Noosa, will finally be part of the scheme. A range of services will be provided under the NDIS, from individualised care plans to access to assistive technologies and referral support. The NDIS will offer security and stability to those who need it most. I know from my time on the NDIS committee and from personal experience that the insurance scheme will be a life-changing experience for many Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the NDIS rollout in Fisher now fast approaching, I've taken the time to meet with locals who will be part of the program. Information sessions hosted by me and attended by representatives of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        allowed locals to understand how the changes will affect them and the ways they can get involved. Almost 200 attendees were able to discuss their individual situation with NDIA representatives to ensure they will be best prepared when the scheme rolls out next year. Next month, I'll host a third information session, for local businesses and service providers looking to become part of the NDIS. The session will outline how prospective service providers can get involved, and there'll be a chance to meet with others who've already signed up to the scheme. I encourage all service providers in Fisher to contact my office for more details.
