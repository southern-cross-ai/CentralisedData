        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to media reports today that the Prime Minister told the coalition party room earlier today that the workers and the workplace conditions at Toyota were responsible for Toyota's decision to leave Australia. Will the Prime Minister tell Toyota workers what he told his party room today—that he believes that they are the highest paid in the world and not productive enough—and is that why Toyota is closing its doors?

         I think that the Leader of the Opposition would be best to rephrase that question because in its current form I do not believe it is in order as it relates to proceedings in the government's party room. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to rephrase his question I will give him that opportunity.

          I refer to reports of the Prime Minister telling a meeting I cannot specify that the workers and workplace conditions at Toyota were responsible for Toyota's decision to leave Australia. Will the Prime Minister tell Toyota workers, the 2½ thousand people who lost their jobs on his watch, that he believes that they were too highly paid and not productive enough and that is why Toyota is closing its doors?

           <p>
            I am happy to assure the Leader of the Opposition that I made no such statement. I made no such statement in the party room or anywhere else. I made no such statement because it is not the case. There were a whole range of factors behind Toyota's decision. Those factors were enumerated to me at different times, including last night, and the sad truth is that the cost of producing cars in this country was simply too high for Toyota to continue. It was simply too high for Toyota to continue.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition wants to sheet all of this home to a government which has been in power for less than six months, as opposed to a government that was in power for six years, but the fact is that 130,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared under members opposite. Motor industry production declined by a third; motor industry employment declined by a quarter; Ford announced their departure; and Mitsubishi did depart—under members opposite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let us not dwell on the past. Let us not play the blame game, which the Leader of the Opposition is so desperate to do. Let us ask ourselves this question: what should this parliament do to make it easier for jobs to be created in this country? What should this parliament do to try to ensure that businesses can flourish in this country? And let us ask the question—

             Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. The boundaries of direct relevance are going a very long way with this answer now.

               Are jobs better protected with a carbon tax or without one? Are jobs better created and protected with a mining tax or without one? Are jobs better protected without an Australian Building and Construction Commission or with one? I say again: I think the workers of Australia know who their real friends in this parliament are.
