        I honour today the late John Cushing, who passed away recently aged 89 years. John served as an Ipswich city councillor and was a champion of Ipswich hockey. In 1992, John was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        in recognition of his service to the sport of hockey and the community. He was granted life membership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 1995. In recognition of five decades of significant contribution to the sport, John was awarded the

         Australian Sports Medal
        </a>
        in the year 2000. He was named Ipswich Citizen of the Year in 1991 for his community service. His lifetime of service included 20 years on the Ipswich ambulance board, 12 as chair. He was a diligent railway fitter and supervisor at the North Ipswich Railway Workshops, where he worked for more than 46 years. Railmotors were his passion. Recognised by the railways commissioner for suggesting the relocation of an oil-filling position on the 2000 class rail motor, he earned a bonus of $5 in 1973. John had a simple approach to getting things done: 'I'm dedicated but low-keyâ€”I don't like a lot of fuss and glory.' He was

        in Ipswich, a lovely, generous, honest caring man. I feel honoured to have known John. My thoughts are with the Cushing, Mantell and Woodford families. John was a true local hero. Vale, John. May you rest in peace.
