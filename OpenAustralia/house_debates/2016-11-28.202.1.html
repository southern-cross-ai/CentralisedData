       <p>
        I rise to speak about an event that I will be attending this Saturday. This weekend I will be attending, as I have done in past years, to celebrate and recognise the achievements of our students at Vietnamese language schools in my electorate of Oxley. This weekend I will be attending the graduation services at the Trung Vuong Vietnamese Language School, which is based at Darra State School, and also the Lac Hong Vietnamese language school, based at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenala_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Glenala State High School
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Both of these schools have been operating in my community for decades. They provide a great cohesion for Vietnamese students who are continuing to learn their language and culture, and they provide the diversity that our suburbs are much known for. I would like to recognise the volunteers, the educators, the principals and the parents who give up their time to support their students; in particular, my friend Khanh-Tien Truong, from the Vietnamese language school at Darra, and also Mr Nguyen Vu, who for decades has been providing support and inspiration for many young Vietnamese in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        These schools provide a vital link to make sure that young Vietnamese Australians continue the traditions and, more importantly, connect with generations of their family that have called the south-west suburbs of Brisbane home. I am proud to have supported these schools for many years and will do so in the years to come.
