        Lester, Uncle Lester, Ecka Checka,

         Big L

        —a man known to many and loved by all. He loved his daughter, Holly, with all his being. His wife, Karen, the centre of his world, passed years ago. His new partner, Maria, was the flame of love and light in Lester's life. He was a man of the community, a dedicated paramedic with the New South Wales Ambulance service. A consummate professional, a pleasure to work with, a man who discharged his duties with the highest empathy and compassion—these are just a few descriptions by his New South Wales Ambulance brothers and sisters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hawkesbury River Ambulance Station, where Lester was posted during his time in the service—with my dad, in fact—is isolated and required high levels of clinical and professional independence. You spend a lot of time by yourself, and those who worked alongside Lester at the river know that it was always gratifying to have him by your side. Following his time in the ambulance service, Lester became actively involved in the Gosford Community Men's Shed. There he found not only a group of people with similar stories to himself but also a group that helped, cared and worked with each other to improve the lives of many. To his daughter, Holly, and partner, Maria, on behalf of the people of Robertson I send my deepest condolences. We wish you love and peace. Paramedic Lester Eccles, car 233: return to station. Your shift has ended; it is now time to rest.
