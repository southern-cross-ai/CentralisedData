       <p>
        I want to address the Queensland government's continued unwillingness to provide details of the Premier's COVID camp plan at Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport. A month ago, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        first floated the idea, and, yesterday, a representative of the Deputy Premier's office confirmed that the state government had not supplied basic details of its plan to the federal government. It's over a month on, and there are still no details, despite repeated requests from the Prime Minister's office, Commonwealth officials, my office and the Toowoomba region community.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         The Premier
        </a>
        stated that the camp would be run by the state government; her deputy said it would be run by the federal government. Which is it? The lack of a detailed plan is causing fear and anxiety in our community, and, every day, I receive more emails and phone calls from the community, from business leaders and from health workers who are frustrated at the lack of detail. I don't blame them. They're trying to be reasonable, but, without these details, how can they be confident in the Premier's plan? The Toowoomba region desperately wants to resolve this issue, and I humbly offer the Premier a solution. It's a simple one: show us the plan. The Premier says the details are there; her deputy says they aren't. Premier, make the details public so we can see for ourselves. This has caused significant fear and concern in the community, and we'd like to resolve this issue as quickly as we can. Premier, this is your proposal; show us your plan.
