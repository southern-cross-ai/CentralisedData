        Today I rise to offer my condolences and acknowledge the extraordinary life of Colin Gramp AM, who passed away in his beloved
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Barossa Valley
        </a>
        aged 98. Known for his contribution to the wine industry, Colin was a community leader who worked tirelessly to grow the reputation of that iconic Barossa. He follows a long line of winemakers, including his great-grandfather,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gramp" rel="nofollow">
         Johann Gramp
        </a>
        , who was the first person to plant vines at the world-renowned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob's_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Jacob's Creek
        </a>
        in 1847, after migrating from Bavaria.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1953, Colin Gramp and the Gramp family revolutionised the Australian wine industry by introducing cold pressure fermentation. At a time when 80 per cent of the wine produced in Australia was fortified wine, this change in fermentation practice helped develop Australian wine into the $45 billion industry it is today. From 1947, Colin was a technical director of G Gramp &amp; Sons, growing the business exponentially before that business was sold in 1976 to what would become the world-renowned Jacob's Creek winery.
       </p>
       <p>
        While he was still at school, Colin unfortunately suffered tragedy, losing his father, Hugo Gramp, in a plane crash. When he spoke of this loss, Colin was saddened not only by the loss of his father but by the realisation that he would never get the great opportunity to work alongside and under his father as his father had done with his grandfather and great-grandfather. Despite the plane crash, when duty called during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Colin bravely volunteered to serve in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        . Between 1942 and 1945, Colin served as an air gunner and was part of the 461 squadronâ€”the squadron that was notoriously engaged in 49 operational sorties.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Colin returned home, he continued to serve his country, but this time it was the community. He became involved in various executive boards around agriculture and show societies to promote our regions across Australia and beyond. To list a few, he was a foundational member and past president of the Barossa Valley vintage festival and a council member of the Royal Agricultural and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticultural_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Horticultural Society
        </a>
        , including serving as its chairman in 1975. He also chaired the Adelaide Wine Show committee in 1974 and served as a council member for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseworthy_Agricultural_College" rel="nofollow">
         Roseworthy Agricultural College
        </a>
        . Through his extensive knowledge of the wine industry, he served and led these organisations successfully for many decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Colin for his military service. I want to thank Colin for his service to the wine industry and broader business community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . And, of course, I want to thank Colin for his invaluable contribution to the community of the Barossa Valley. Vale, Colin Gramp AM.
