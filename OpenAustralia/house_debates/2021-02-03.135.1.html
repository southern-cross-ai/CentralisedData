        I'm pleased to be able to speak today about Lugarno Lions and the incredible work they do in our community in Banks. Since 1974, Lugarno Lions have raised more than $3 million for community projects in our area. Year in and year out, the members of Lugarno Lions go above and beyond to do so much work for our community. This year was a difficult year, of course. Because of COVID-19, Lugarno Lions weren't able to hold the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Spring Festival
        </a>
        , which is such a massive event every year, usually at Gannons Park. It couldn't be held this year, but the Lions went on, nonetheless, to go through a range of different activities to raise funds for our community. They still held their Christmas raffle and still did so many other activities. They've been a great supporter over the years of the Autism Community Network, a wonderful group in our community that works with families with kids with autism. They've helped out the Riverwood Air League over many years and many other great local non-profit organisations. To the president,

        , and to everyone at Lugarno Lions: thank you so much for what you do for our community.

        dance studio in Peakhurst is one of the most renowned dance schools anywhere in Australia. Many hundreds of students are there, and it was great on 18 December to attend their annual presentation. Belinda Agostino and Priscilla Severino have done a remarkable job with All Starz and have won the small business of the year award in previous years because of the strength of their classes there. With more than 800 students, many of whom have gone on to perform nationally, it is a tremendous community there at All Starz. Congratulations to All Starz on another great year.

        , and the rest of the committee who have done such a great job at East Hills. East Hills is one of the backbones of the Canterbury-Bankstown rugby league community. It has been around for many, many decades and has been a breeding ground for some of the great stars of the past. To Mark Smith and everyone at East Hills rugby league: congratulations on a great year.
