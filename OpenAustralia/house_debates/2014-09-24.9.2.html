       <p>
        On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Procedure I present the committee's report entitled
        <i>
         Use of electronic devices in the chamber and Federation Chamber
        </i>
        , together with the minutes of proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with standing order 39(e) the report was made a Parliamentary Paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”Changes in communications, such as the increased use of smart phones and tablets and the ease of access and portability provided by wireless connectivity have been embraced wholeheartedly by members of the House. Many now use electronic devices, including through social media, to communicate from within the chamber and the Federation Chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report examines the House's current regulatory framework regarding the use of electronic devices and the way members are currently using devices. It considers issues such as the potential impact on order in the chamber, respect for the role of the chair and the likely status of comments made by members on social media.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Procedure Committee
        </a>
        sought members' views throughout the inquiry. It invited written submissions, held a roundtable meeting and wrote to members about the possible outcomes of the inquiry. A number of members indicated they would like to have a comprehensive and authoritative source of guidance on the use of electronic devices in the chamber and Federation Chamber. The committee has made two recommendations, which it hopes will assist members to understand their responsibilities when they use electronic devices to communicate from the chamber and Federation Chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first recommendation relates to a current publication, the
        <i>
         Guidelines for
        </i>
        <i>
         M
        </i>
        <i>
         embers on the status and handling of their records and correspondence
        </i>
        , that our colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests have published for some years now. The guidelines are helpful, and provide practical advice on the usual issues encountered by members in their correspondence and records, including their status. The report recommends that the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests consider expanding the guidelines to address communications made by members using electronic devices.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should add that the Procedure Committee has no wish to impinge on the remit of our colleagues on the Privileges and Members' Interests Committee and the recommendation is intended as an indication of respect for the practical and authoritative nature of the guidelines. Expanding their coverage would provide members with a single source of guidance on a wide range of their typical communications.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second recommendation is focused entirely on the use of electronic devices by members in the chamber, Federation Chamber and committees. It proposes that the House adopt a resolution in the terms contained in the report. In his submission to the inquiry, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
         Clerk of the House
        </a>
        proposed a draft resolution for the committee's consideration. The committee circulated its terms to all members for comment during the inquiry. The feedback was very positive. The proposed resolution encapsulates the present position in a concise and straightforward way.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to thank all members who assisted the committee by providing submissions, attending the round table and providing informal feedback. I also wish to thank the Clerk for his submissions and briefings. I conclude by thanking my colleagues on the Procedure Committee for their work on this inquiry. I wish to also acknowledge the work of and thank the committee secretary Miss Catherine Cornish, inquiry secretary Mrs Lynne Eveston and their research officers. We have worked effectively and harmoniously on this first inquiry. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House and move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House take note of the report.
