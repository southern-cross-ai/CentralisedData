        I rise today to say a big thankyou to the Philipzen family, a name that many families in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bega_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Bega Valley
        </a>
        will be familiar with. It's synonymous with the Bega War Memorial Swimming Pool. The family has run the pool for more than 45 years.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Harris" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Harris
        </a>
        ran the pool for 39 years, before Phil's daughter Zoe and her husband Mark took over. As one of the families who has benefited from their hard work, I say thank you, and I wish you all the best in your next chapter, focusing on Henry. The public are invited to drop in to Bega War Memorial Swimming Pool between now and 28 March next year to share your stories and memories of their time running the pool.
       </p>

        A huge and heartfelt congratulations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Foster" rel="nofollow">
         Barbara Foster
        </a>
        from Yass who has won the Centre for Volunteering Senior Volunteer of the Year. Barbara leads a small band of volunteers who open the New South Wales National Trust's Cooma Cottage and garden to visitors ranging from schoolchildren to historians, film crews to family reunions and weddings. Barbara's extensive role also includes organising major events like the recent 150th anniversary of the

        expedition. Thank you, Barbara, and well done for being recognised for your huge volunteering effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another shoutout goes to the Queanbeyan Sleepbus team, which was recognised in the same awards for their ongoing support towards homelessness. The volunteer team provides small sleeping pods to those in our community sleeping rough, which comes with all that they need for an overnight stay. Since 2021, Sleepbus has helped more than 1,100 people with safe sleeps. Well done on winning this award. More importantly, thank you for everything you do week in and week out for our community. You are an amazing volunteer team and this is a great recognition.

        I was recently one of 15,000 visitors who streamed through the gates at Murrumbateman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Days" rel="nofollow">
         Field Days
        </a>
        . In the best of traditions, the Field Days are an opportunity for the country and the city to come together to see, experience and taste the best on offer. The Murrumbateman Field Days certainly delivered, with over 300 exhibitors. You could taste apples from Batlow, olives from the Gilmore Valley and bread from Murrumbateman. You could sample gin from Braidwood and Tumbarumba, beer from Tumut and wine from Murrumbateman. The food was amazing, with Yass Public School, Binalong Public School, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        providing sausage sandwiches, scones and spuds to keep up our strength. The Murrumbateman Community Association does such a great job organising this year in and year out, so make sure you book a weekend in Murrumbateman on 19 and 20 October next year, when the Murrumbateman Field Days will once again be held.

        Lastly, a quick shoutout to Dr Corin Miller of Merimbula, who took out the Rural/Remote Health Professional of the Year award in the inaugural National Rural and Remote Health Awards last night. She runs the fully integrated Jinggi Gudjaagalali Kids Clinic, which helps with early intervention on a range of health measures. Well done, Corinâ€”you're a legend.
