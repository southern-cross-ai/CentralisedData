       <p>
        Today I would like to talk about a truly awful occurrence in my electorate of Chisholm. Two weeks ago Monash Men's Shed, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Waverley
        </a>
        , was broken into, with thieves making off with more than $20,000 worth of tools and electrical equipment. Anything that wasn't bolted down was taken, and damage was also done to the shed itself. This is a huge blow to an organisation that gives so much to our local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last two years I have been so lucky to visit the shed for lunches and talks and just to chat with members over a cuppa. You couldn't hope to meet better people. Greg and the rest of the team there do such an amazing job for our community, providing a space for blokes to talk, cook, make stuff and learn new things. Just a couple of months ago I visited the shed for lunch and to hear a talk from an expert on dementia. It was really informative, and I left feeling so happy and grateful that this incredible resource exists for Chisholm's men.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men's sheds across the country provide a safe and friendly environment for men to gather and/or work on meaningful projects, with the ultimate aim of improving the health and wellbeing of their members. They address social isolation and boost men's mental health. They also provide vital health information and resources that men may not usually access or may be reluctant to access by themselves. A study in 2013 found that men's sheds members had significantly better scores than non-men's sheds members for physical functioning, general health, vitality and mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are now more than a thousand men's sheds around Australia. The government recognises the invaluable contribution they make to communities across the country and the substantial positive impact they have on men's mental health, with $1 million worth of grants each year through the National Shed Development Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forming close friendships with others is particularly critical in supporting men's mental health and reducing the risk of suicide. I know that connections forged through men's sheds have been hugely helpful for members of my community in Chisholm, especially through the pandemic. During lockdown, Greg and other members of the Monash Men's Shed have continued to find ways to reach out to, engage with and connect with their members while they are physically apart. The shed phone continues to be manned between 10 in the morning and 12 pm for any man wanting a chat or support. This, of course, is in addition to the many phone calls that they make to their members and the activities that they offer over Zoom.
       </p>
       <p>
        It beggars belief that anyone would want to harm this incredible organisation or disrupt its important work. I can only assume that the thieves did not know exactly where they were or who they were stealing from. The alternative is too horrible to think about. Whatever the criminals' motives or intentions, one thing is clear: the Monash Men's Shed and its members truly did not deserve this awful and shameful act. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help replace some of the stolen items, install a security system at the workshop and continue to contribute to the shed's mental health program. I know it is a lot to ask in what are already difficult times, but I encourage locals in Chisholm and anyone listening who can spare it to chip in and help out. Any donation, big or small, would be greatly appreciated.
