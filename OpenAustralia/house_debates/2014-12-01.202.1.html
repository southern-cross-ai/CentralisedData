       <p>
        Good government is about vision and planning. The aim is to make sure that our final outcome is always of benefit to the Australian nation. Just before the election in 2013 we were assured by the then Labor government that the government debt for 2013-14 was to be $18.5 billionâ€”never mind that it was originally supposed to be close to surplus. But what we found after the election was a $30 billion difference. The debt level had skyrocketed to $48.5 billion. This is unacceptable. In all areas, reduction is a must and savings have to be made. We simply cannot continue to borrow money internationally to pay off debt.

        One of the original proposals to make such reductions impacted on the pay package offered to our Defence personnel. Gilmore is, and always will be, a Navy region, and despite the need for savings it is no secret that I have had concerns about some of the proposed changes, particularly the changes to recreation leave as well as tax-free income and allowances. After months of discussions with our ministers and the Prime Minister, I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of changes to the original proposals. They are: reinstating the additional five days of extra recreation leave a year for arduous service, adding to the existing 20 days of annual leave and the 10 days of additional recreation leave; reinstating the second extra day of Christmas leave; maintaining the existing motor vehicle arrangements; and reinstating off-base ongoing food allowance. Many in Gilmore will be proud of this.
