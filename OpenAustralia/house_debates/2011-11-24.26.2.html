       That this House:

      <p class="italic">

      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (3) recognises that the attack remained a secret for many years and that even today, many Australians are unaware of the bombing of Darwin and the significant damage and loss of life which resulted;
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (4) also recognises the campaign of coordinated bombings against northern Australia involving 97 Japanese attacks from Darwin, to Broome and Wyndham in the west, to Katherine in the south, to Townsville in the east over the period February 1942 to November 1943; and
      </p>
      <p class="italic">

        Before I begin my remarks on the motion, I would first like to pay special tribute to the former Speaker, the member for Scullin. I thank him for his humour and patience with all of the new members of this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Labor Party have finally come on board to support this motion on the bombing of Darwin moved by the coalition earlier this year. My motion was never about politics; it is all about my community. My local community is passionate about the commemoration of the bombing of Darwin and about ensuring that all Australians understand our contribution to the defence of Australia in the darkest days of World War

        The bombing of Darwin was the first time Australia was attacked by enemy forces. Bombing raids by Japanese forces over Darwin continued for many months and extended to other northern Australian cities, including Broome, Cairns and Townsville. More than 250 people were killed in the attack on Darwin and many more were injured. A

       </p>
       <p>
        Since my first days in this parliament I have been a vocal advocate of Australians better understanding the bombing of Darwin and the role Territorians played in the defence of Australia during

        </a>
        . I thank the Leader of the Opposition for working closely with me on this initiative, which is something I worked on prior to and after my election to parliament some 15 months ago. Today's outcome is also a significant event for Dr Tom Lewis of the Darwin Military Museum. He has worked tirelessly for a number of years to raise awareness of this event and he was one of the key members of the public who lobbied me to make sure that I brought it to the attention of the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge Darwin Lord Mayor Graeme Sawyer and his aldermen, who have also been instrumental in ensuring that I raise awareness of this very, very important date in our history. I am delighted that this motion is going to be supported and that it has come in time for the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. I acknowledge the efforts of all the people who have raised awareness of this event. I thank my colleagues Senator Scullion and Senator Ronaldson, who were able to have the same motion passed in the Senate. From now on, 19 February each year will be recognised by all Australians as a day of significance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the House and in particular my coalition colleagues for their support. I commend the motion to the House.
