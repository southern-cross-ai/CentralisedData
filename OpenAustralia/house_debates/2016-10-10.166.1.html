        After a decade and a half of war, conflict in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        is an abstraction for many Australians. Their understanding is largely shaped by fragmented media images. One of the themes common to western democracies over the last 15 years of war is a growing distance between the military who serve overseas and the citizenry who send them. We, as members of parliament, must always strive to close that gap by clearly articulating the reasons why we send Australians to war and ensuring they are supported both morally and materially. This should especially be the case when we share a bipartisan resolve. We are at war with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        , or Daesh. We will defeat
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS" rel="nofollow">
         IS
        </a>
        and free the Syrian and Iraqi people held captive by that evil regime, and that future victory is being made possible by the contribution of the deployed ADF personnel. These men and women are bringing stability to that region and safety to this nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014, IS burst on to the international scene. It proclaimed its caliphate across territory in Iraq and Syria. From that position, it has launched attacks across the world. It has targeted the west. It has wrought horror, destruction and fear. An effective response needed to be clear, decisive and overwhelming. From the outset, this government has provided the framework for the fight against IS. Our framework remains to disrupt, degrade and defeat IS. Our sailors, soldiers and airmen, working as part of a global coalition, needed to have the space and time to execute that plan. Almost a year on since I last spoke on this subject, we can see the government's resolve and confidence in that strategy is paying dividends. The ADF have performed magnificently in degrading Islamic State and we are trending towards victory.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the fight against IS, we are not combating a group of mindless violent thugs. What motivates them is a coherent ideology with its own rules and goals. Theology is the cornerstone of their strategic framework, but it is also the key to their downfall. This is a contest of ideas and IS ideology requires external validation. Put simply, territory and expansion are key components of Islamic State's theology. A caliphate is territory; a caliph its leader. A caliph requires territory from which to wage war and implement sharia. Every victory we have, every metre of ground IS loses, undermines their legitimacy and authority. Unlike al-Qaeda, a caliphate cannot exist underground. Take away its territory and you take away its capacity to exist. The longer a caliph goes without making offensive jihad, as Islamic State refer it, the weaker his authority becomes. There is a strict criterion to be caliph. A shrinking caliphate will lose the allegiance of its fighters.
       </p>
       <p>
        IS have not had a major battlefield success in Iraq in over a year. Their strategic aims, so closely linked to their world view, are crumbling before them. Every material defeat is a victory for the coalition, a raid against it. They are now facing an existential crisis both material and, more importantly, ideological. Fighter desertions are increasing. That is why the ADF's contribution in the region is so significant. Our troops involved in Task Group Taji have assisted in the training of more than 30,000 Iraqi security forces. These forces have spearheaded the recapture of more than 45 per cent of IS territory in Iraq. They have liberated major centres like Ramadi, Hit and Fallujah, and scores of villages and communities are now free of IS barbarism. They are on track to liberate Mosul. Our air task group has also had considerable success. Its contribution to the 13,500 strikes in Iraq and Syria has helped to contain, impede and cripple IS.
       </p>
       <p>
        Much of IS's critical infrastructure has been destroyed and its financial support reduced. Over 10,000 square kilometres in Syria has been reclaimed. A special operations task force is also in the region, providing advice and assistance to the Iraqi counterterrorism service. Right now, coalition forces are staging to retake the Syrian village of Dabiq, which occupies a significant place in IS's theology and strategy. According to IS, the armies of Islam will supposedly win a decisive victory over Western forces here. To lose Dabiq would be a blow from which IS might never recover, as it would prove false one of their central ideas. Indeed, Dabiq is the name of their e-magazine, a key component of their propaganda arm that is used to recruit and radicalise young Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The men and women of the ADF are crushing IS. Their contribution is keeping the people of Australia safe. They are protecting our way of life and securing the future of our children. Today we acknowledge their service to Australia, the sacrifice their families endure in their lengthy absences and their vital role in what will be the historic and enduring defeat of Islamic State.

          I second the motion moved by the member for Canning. Firstly, I thank the member for Canning for bringing this matter to our attention, and also say to him, 'Thank you for your service in uniform for this country and for the role you have played'. I also acknowledge my friend, the member for Solomon, who is a former Army officer, and the member for Eden-Monaro for their service to this country of ours.
         </p>
         <p>
          We can be very proud of our men and women in uniform and should never forget what they do for us. Last week I had the great privilege of attending the launch of
          <i>

           Chris Masters
          </a>
          in partnership with the Australian War Memorial and Luscious International, that tell the story, through their own eyes and with their own words, of Australian serving personnel—

           Air Force
          </a>
          , Navy, Army—telling what their service entailed, what was involved and what sacrifices they made. The documentary also talks about those who were lost—the 41 Australians whose lives passed so tragically—through interviews with the survivors, their partners, their families. I know one family in particular from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          —the family of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Palmer" rel="nofollow">
           Scott Palmer
          </a>
          . Since his passing, his mum, Pam, and Ray, her husband, have been great advocates for the need to address the concerns of Australian defence personnel once they have come back home.
         </p>
         <p>
          I commend this documentary. I hope we can have it distributed widely, seen in the parliament and on public television, because it tells us very graphically about the sacrifices that were referred to by the member for Canning. It gives us great clarity about the sacrifices that are made and the contributions that are being made on our behalf by those brave men and women in uniform. It shows women at the front line in a way we have not seen so graphically previously, even though, today—as a result of work which I, in fact, was involved in with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Defence
          </a>
          —effectively all jobs in the Defence Force are open to women, should they be able to achieve the physical standards that are required and provided they have the psychological aptitude et cetera.
         </p>
         <p>
          What I have come to see, over the many years that I have been in this place and over the number of times I have been to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East
          </a>
          since the early 2000s, is that we cannot underestimate the role our Defence Force personnel play. The member for Canning referred to the fight against
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS" rel="nofollow">
           IS
          </a>
          IS. I have great faith in the leadership of our defence community. I have great faith not only in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Chief of the Defence Force
          </a>
          and the seniors but also in the platoon commanders: those young men and women whose job it is to lead young Australian men and women at war. When you contemplate their bravery—the need for them to be creative, to be decision makers—and see how well they perform, is it any wonder we should have nothing but praise for them?
         </p>
         <p>
          At the same time, I do not think we have due regard to the trauma that they are witness to and that they are forced to endure: to see mates lost in battle. There is a very graphic illustration of this on the back of the
          <i>
           Afghanistan: The Australian Story
          </i>
          DVD cover. It shows sappers
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Smith" rel="nofollow">
           Darren Smith
          </a>
          and Jacob Moreland and their bomb-detection dog, Herbie. All three were killed by an improvised explosive device on 7 June 2010. This is a graphic illustration of what war means. This image—of two vital, brave young men and their dog—says to us that, when we ask our men and women to go away for us, we potentially expect them to make the ultimate sacrifice. What is left behind is not only their heritage—the heritage of all men and women in uniform—but also the suffering of their families, their friends and their comrades. So, when we are thinking today about Australian men and women in uniform, let us also think about those who are left behind when those who pay the ultimate sacrifice do not come back to us.

           personnel. I would like to recognise the military service of the member for Canning and thank him for being here and moving this motion. This motion recognises the importance of our nation's contribution to international peace, but, more importantly, it recognises the importance—
          </p>

          <p>
           This motion recognises the importance of our nation's contribution to international peace and, more importantly, it recognises the important role that our service personnel play in maintaining that peace globally. Their sacrifice, their dedication, makes this world a more secure one and a better one. Security overseas means security at home. When we talk about a world free from terror, we are also talking about the service of so many of our fellow Australians who are in our military. As the member for Warringah has been heard to say, they have served. We are honoured by their service. Our military is currently one of the best in the world. It is better trained and better resourced than so many others globally. It plays a critical role in promoting peace in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           , under Operations Accordion and Okra, and in Afghanistan under Operation Highroad. In Fiji, our armed forces have been critical in helping rebuild that nation after tropical Cyclone Winston.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is important to note that so often in the past we have won the war but we have lost the peace. These operations are about ensuring that we continue to win the peace so we do not have to go to war so often. The ADF's longest operation is Mazurka, which is the peacekeeping operation in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Desert" rel="nofollow">
            Sinai Desert
           </a>
           following the war between Egypt and Israel in 1967. This operation has been complicated more recently due to the changing security situation in that area, yet our armed forces continue to provide security in the Sinai Desert.
          </p>

           My electorate of Mackellar is home to many serving officers, especially from the 101st commando squad, who recently celebrated their 60th anniversary in Sydney in the presence of the Governor-General, His Excellency Sir Peter Cosgrove. Their commanding officer,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Stevens" rel="nofollow">
            Matt Stevens
           </a>
           , is a credit to our nation and to his unit. Pittwater House in my electorate continues its tradition of having one of the most active cadet units in Australia. Recently I attended their annual parade and I can certainly say that the enthusiasm that the students have for their cadet unit has only increased over time. At every commemoration on the northern beaches, you can find Pittwater House cadets forming the counter flag unit and doing our community proud.

           </a>
           is one of the most dynamic in the country. It is experimenting with new programs to help our veterans transition from the military to civilian life. Under
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Webb" rel="nofollow">
            Ben Webb
           </a>
           , progress is being made on new database tools, coordination and practical programs that help make that transition easier. As Ben has explained to me, many people who serve in the military find that they come out of the military and have to do things that they are not used to doing—for example, simple things like budgeting for their day-to-day lives. His centre at Dee Why RSL is helping serving officers transition to civilian life in a more practical and seamless fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
           I do not want to forget Tamara Sloper, who somehow hoodwinked me into doing 22 push-ups every day to assist veterans make the transition as well. Mackellar has numerous active RSL clubs. Their contributions to our community are priceless and ongoing. They remind us that their service is broader than combat exercises in many parts of the world. Our military keep the piece, rebuild broken communities, ensure a safer world and then continue to make contributions when they return. I am honoured to represent so many of those in my community who have served.

            I address my remarks to the men and women of the

           </p>
           <p>
            Members of the three armed services—Navy, Army and Airforce—continue to be proud ambassadors for our country overseas. ADF members are currently serving in the

            For my electorate of Solomon, we are the tip of the spear of the Australian Defence Force with all three arms of the Defence Force operating in the defence of Australia and our interests. We have major bases including naval bases 1st Brigade at

            Base Darwin. From these bases thousands of Australian service personnel have been deployed on operations and are currently deployed on operations, including 50 Darwin based soldiers currently serving in Iraq with Task Group Taji.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to associate myself with the words of the member for Canning in relation to the absolute professionalism of those members of Task Group Taji. That task group has been particularly well led. The training task unit,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTU" rel="nofollow">

            , and, by all accounts, is living up to these exceedingly high standards. Darwin based soldiers are also deployed in other theatres of operation, and I want to acknowledge the sacrifices made by the families of these Defence Force members whilst they are overseas deployed in our name.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is of course essential that our deployed Defence Force men and women are well supported in the execution of their jobs for our country, and I know the Australian Defence Force community ensures that that occurs. To everyone who is playing a role in supporting our ADF members overseas, thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ADF is extremely well led, as the member for Lingiari mentioned earlier, and I am very proud of my association and of my family's association with this marvellous cornerstone of our nation. Just as important as the support needed on operations is the support those service men and women receive on their return to Australia and to their homes, and, indeed, through the transition when they ultimately leave the Defence Force to rejoin civilian life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, the work of our Australian Defence Force is very dangerous. We have had members of our Australian Defence Force seriously injured and killed during training and on operations including those from the

           </p>
           <p>
            I wish to finish with a message from Ray and Pam Palmer to our Defence Force personnel currently serving overseas in our name:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We would like to let them know that they are doing an outstanding job and that they are certainly making us proud of them. It really doesn't matter what their jobs are; we can honestly say we are so proud of them. They are a true credit not only to their parents here at home but also to all Australians.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Over the past 6 years, we have certainly met many of our young defence personnel. They certainly have always shown us so much respect, and we would like to thank them for that indeed. We are not only talking about us, but we can certainly mention other families that have lost their sons over in Afghanistan, and they all say the same."
           </p>
           <p>
            It is an honour to be able to read these words on behalf of ay and Pam Palmer. To our deployed troops, thank you for your service. Stay safe and God bless.
