       <p>
        I want to thank my community for getting vaccinated in large numbers, and I want to thank the health workers who have worked in clinics across the country. I'm vaccinated, my family is vaccinated. In my region, first dose is at 95 per cent at the moment, and second dose is close to 90 per cent. Vaccination has allowed us to open our economy and it has also meant our hospitals haven't been overrun.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we approach the completion of the vaccination rollout, it's very important for the state government to lift restrictions on those who have chosen not to be vaccinated. I understand why state governments had restrictions when vaccination levels were low, but they are not low now. We can't have a segregated society of those who are and those who are not vaccinated. We have achieved some of the best vaccination levels in the world, so I will continue to lobby the state government to lift these restrictions on those who choose not to be vaccinated. We live in a free country, and while I don't agree with those who choose not to be vaccinated, I respect their right to make this decision. Restrictions on their lives need to be lifted. We have arrived at some of the highest vaccination levels in the world, and therefore the segregation needs to end.

        I would like to acknowledge Eulalie Hayes for more than 60 years of service to netball in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley
        </a>
        . In 1963, Eulalie and her sister Narelle responded to an ad in a local paper looking to establish a woman's netball team in Grafton. Eight years later, Eulalie was coaching 10 teams. She was also treasurer of the Grafton Netball Association for more than 10 years. In the seventies, she was made a life member of the association. Her 38-year involvement with Grafton netball came to a close in 1998, when she retired from work to move to Gulmarrad with her husband, Barry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eulalie then occupied many positions in the Lower Clarence Netball Association, including president, rep convener, coaching convener and treasurer. She received the club person of the year and the Ernie Muller award in 2010 for her contribution to Lower Clarence sport, and in 2012 she was awarded the Lower Clarence Netball Association life membership. Eulalie is still an active member of the association and is at the courts every Saturday during the season. She's a mentor to players and coaches. She also has a coaching award and a court named after her in Grafton.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eulalie, your contribution to netball in our community is outstanding, and I thank you for this. I know your family; Barry, your three children, Tanya, Roslyn and Martin, and Terry and Kate, as well as your five grandchildren, Kyle, Joel, Ryan, Hannah and Piper, are all very proud of you.
