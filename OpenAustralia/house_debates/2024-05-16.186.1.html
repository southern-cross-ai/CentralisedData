       <p>
        Firstly, I do want to extend my condolences to the member for Ballarat and to John's family.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Australians deserve to have access to affordable and accessible health care. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Ranges
        </a>
        , this means a strong and reliable healthcare system that is close to home and supports our community when we need it most. Currently, in the Yarra Ranges, an area of 2½ thousand square kilometres, options for urgent health care are limited. At a time when local families are struggling to pay the bills, access to bulk-billing clinics is limited, with only several across the electorate of Casey. On top of this, across our community, which spans 2½ thousand square kilometres, there is not one single emergency department. That's not good enough. Our community deserves better access to quality health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Improving the accessibility and affordability of Yarra Ranges health care would improve community health and stop minor issues becoming more serious and adding to our already stretched hospitals and healthcare systems. That's why I launched a petition to establish a Medicare urgent care clinic in the Yarra Ranges which would provide walk-in appointments for urgent medical needs, eliminating the stress of finding a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        appointment; bulk-billing services, ensuring everyone in our community can access affordable health care; and extended hours, including evenings and weekends, so you can receive care when you need it most. Locals know why we need this improved health care, and that's why, within 72 hours of launching my petition to establish a Yarra Ranges Medicare urgent care clinic, over 1,500 people had signed it and joined our campaign for better local health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        My community and I were pleased that, in Tuesday's budget, the government committed to establishing 29 urgent care clinics across the nation. I give credit where it's due. But, unfortunately, there are still no details as to the locations. Residents and families are relying on improved local health care, so it is important for the government to establish a Medicare urgent care clinic in the Yarra Ranges. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to listen to the thousands of Yarra Ranges residents who signed my petition and deliver better local health care for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together, we'll continue to fight for improved access to affordable health care in our community, because we deserve no less. This is the test for this Prime Minister, to see whether he understands the challenges of our community. Across 2½ thousand square kilometres, there is not an emergency department in sight. This is the perfect location for an urgent care clinic, so we await the details of the 29 locations.
