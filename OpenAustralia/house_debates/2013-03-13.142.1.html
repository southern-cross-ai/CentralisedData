        On 15 March 2013, schools across Australia will celebrate the third annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day" rel="nofollow">
         National Day
        </a>
        of Action Against Bullying and Violence, an initiative of governments and schools across the country calling on school communities to 'take a stand together' against bullying and violence. Students across Australia will participate in raising the profile of the antibullying message, fostering positive and supportive social environments and increasing awareness of local counterbullying initiatives within their school and school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around one in four Australian year 4 to year 9 students report being bullied at least every few weeks, with the highest rate of bullying occurring amongst year 5 and year 8 students, which are tough years at any time for young people. What is not so well known is that, in 87 per cent of bullying cases, students' peers are present as onlookers. These bystanders play a key part in the bullying process by not speaking out and by being seen to condone the bullying actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been contacted by young Jacob Kokins, a year 4 student from Newcastle, who told me about his ordeal with bullying at school. Jacob is a brave young man who has Asperger's syndrome and he asked that I bring to the attention of the House of Representatives the fact that bullying in schools is still a major issue faced by young people. Jacob has told me that, even though he has started in a new school in a special class, he feels unwanted because he is different. I say to Jacob, his parents and the wider school community across Australia that we really need schools to take a zero tolerance approach to bullying because it can destroy lives, and it should certainly not be viewed as routine or 'a part of growing up'. Bullying in the school years will invariably contribute to mental health issues faced by many young Australians, with many victims of bullying experiencing low self-esteem, and depression and anxiety issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, there have been documented cases locally, in the Newcastle region, of school-age children taking their own lives after having been bullied. They should know, and the school community should know, that there is always help available—teachers, principals, counsellors, parents, headspace, Kids Helpline and many other services. The important thing is not to stay silent about bullying.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the modern world, students are being exposed to new types of bullying not just in the classroom but also online, in cyberspace. Because of this, parents, teachers, principals, governments and communities are trying to keep one step ahead of the bullies with appropriate measures to ensure our kids are safe, which can be difficult. There is no place for bullying, violence or intimidation inside or outside of our schools. Bullying is a pattern of behaviour by an individual or a group of individuals through verbal, physical, social or psychological behaviour that harms and intimidates one or more people. It can include shoving, name-calling, spreading rumours and social exclusion though email, chats and on social networks such as Facebook. Eighty-three per cent of students who bully others online also bully offline, with 84 per cent of those bullied online also bullied offline. If bullying behaviour and culture is not addressed at a schooling level, it will continue into other walks of life, such as one's working and professional life. Too often we hear of workplace bullying and harassment, a pattern of behaviour just like that found in the schoolyard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research by Professor Dan Olweus in Norway and Sweden suggests:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … bullying can lead to criminal behavior later in life: 60 percent of males who were bullies in grades 6 through 9 were convicted of at least one crime as adults, compared with 23 percent of males who did not bully; 35 to 40 percent of these former bullies had three or more convictions by age 24, compared with 10 percent of those who did not bully.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must also look at the cause of bullying, with many bullies actually victims themselves, either at school or often in the home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government's National Safe Schools Framework is the first of its kind in the world, offering guiding principles that help school communities to develop positive and practical safety and wellbeing policies We have invested almost $4 million in online tools and resources to assist with this process. I encourage teachers, parents and students to visit bullyingnoway.gov.au to explore the range of resources, lesson plans, competitions and fact sheets available to assist with bullying issues and creative positive relationships in the school environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best way that students can assist in combating bullying is by speaking out, not being a bystander. I would like to thank Jacob for his courage and for his belief in himself for speaking up in this important week. It is up to everyone to create positive environments that eliminate discrimination, intolerance and bullying.
