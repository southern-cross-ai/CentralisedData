       <p>
        On the weekend, tragedy struck at a small country cricket field, Karramomus, when batsman Vino Kumar suffered a life-threatening heart attack. He was standing at the non-strikers end and he collapsed, but what happened next was a true show of great Australian spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opposing players from the Murchison Cricket Club moved quickly to Vino's aid. Two Murchison cricketers, Darryn Rowney and Bryce Wellington, knew exactly what to do and rolled Vino into the recovery position. After just a few minutes, however, Vino's breathing became weaker and he eventually stopped breathing, so Darryn and Bryce immediately began

        </a>
        . The cricket club had called the ambulance—of course quite a distance away—and they were on their way to this place while Darryn and Bryce continued the life-saving CPR.
       </p>
       <p>
        When both firefighters and ambulance crews arrived, they continued working to save Vino, eventually stabilising him and transporting him to the

        base hospital. He was then transferred to

        </a>
        in Melbourne and is recovering. From all reports he will be well again—hopefully well enough to play cricket. The president of Karramomus Cricket Club, Paul Trevaskis, and Vino's team captain, Ash Hooper, then drove Mrs Kumar to Melbourne to be at her husband's side.
       </p>
       <p>
        These actions show the true meaning of sportsmanship, comradery and, above all else, our love and compassion for one another. Two games of cricket were abandoned at that time and no-one complained. It was all about supporting Vino Kumar and his family. I want to congratulate everyone involved.
