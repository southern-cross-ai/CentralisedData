        parliament from 1971 to 1978. He was born on 29 July 1919 and died on 13 June 2008. Alan served as the member for Wakehurst in the New South Wales parliament for seven years and seven months. During that time he served as the shadow minister for transport and the shadow minister for corrective services. The seat of Wakehurst forms part of my seat of Mackellar. He had a distinguished service record, commencing in 1935. He served as a senior cadet gunner in the 5th Brigade of the

        After the war Alan worked in advertising for
