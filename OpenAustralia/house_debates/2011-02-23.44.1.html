       <p>
        Last week I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Windsor Park
        </a>
        Multi-Purpose Community, Leisure and Wellbeing Centre. I was thrilled that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar
        </a>
        residents now have access to this first-class facility including a medical centre, allied health services, gymnasium, childcare centre, cafe and council offices as well as an outdoor recreation centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the 1960s Windsor Park has been a popular recreational area for the West Tamar residents. It is fantastic to see the new developments carrying on this sporting tradition as well as promoting health and wellbeing. During the planning and development stages of the project over 100 jobs were created in the local area. Now, at completion, there are 10 permanent positions. It is estimated that 550 people per day will visit the site. Social and community opportunities are created by providing access both to healthcare professionals and medical facilities as well as non-competitive recreational and sporting activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar_Council" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar Council
        </a>
        , the local community and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor
        </a>
        government for their respective contributions. The federal Labor government committed $3 million to this Windsor Park Multipurpose and Wellbeing Centre under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. This is just one of many examples of the federal Labor government supporting local communities and building the infrastructure that people in local communities want and need.
