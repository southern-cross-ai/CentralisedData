       <p>
        One woman dies every eight hours from ovarian cancer. It is the ninth-most-common cancer and the most lethal of all the gynaecological cancers. It has few warning symptoms and no early detection testâ€”it is called the silent killer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four women are diagnosed each and every day in Australia. Whether it is ovarian or cervical cancer, endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome, successive governments have failed to recognise the value of funding research into these women's issues adequately. It is just another reason why women are needed in this place, sitting at the decision-making tables leading those debates and helping to tackle the issues that are facing women, who make up half the population.
       </p>
       <p>
        Women's issues and issues affecting gynaecological health had been ignored and overlooked for far too long. This year I'm very proud to be participating in Frocktober, where team Lindsay ladies frock up to raise money and awareness for ovarian cancer and a diagnostic screening test for early diagnosis that will help reduce the fatality rate of this silent killer. Frocktober is in its 12th year and continues to get bigger and better each year. It involves wearing a dress each day and snapping a photo to share on social media to encourage others to encourage awareness of the 1,600 women who are diagnosed every single year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge those around me have taken up the fight: the Lindsay Ladies Frock Up! team: Amanda Wiley, Janis Donnelly-Coode and Peggy Wilcox, inspired by the formidable Ellie Whiteaker, who participated last year and clocked over $4,000 in donations. A massive shout-out to all those people have already supported our efforts. Currently, our team has $1,500 and will power through the second part of the month hoping to double that. I implore anybody who can to frock-up and donate to help together to frock cancer.
