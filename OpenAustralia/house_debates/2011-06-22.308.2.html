       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges the importance of the role that non-government schools play in reflecting the diversity of Australian society and serving a broad range of students, including those from a variety of religions, social backgrounds, regions, and socio-economic circumstances;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) supports the continuation of a funding model into the future that distributes funds according to socio economic need and which recognises that every non-government school student is entitled to a basic level of government funding;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to continue to support parents in their right to chose a school which they believe best reflects their values and beliefs, by not penalising parents who wish to make private contributions towards their child's education, nor discouraging schools in their efforts to fundraise or encourage private investment;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) notes the many submissions made to the Review of Funding for Schooling by non government sector authorities requesting that changes to school funding arrangements not leave schools or students worse off in real terms;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) acknowledges that any reduction in government funding for non-government schools would need to be addressed by increasing the level of private income required to be raised by the school community (such as school fees), or through a reduction in the quality of the educational provision in affected schools; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) calls on the Government to make a clear commitment to the continuation of current funding levels to all non-government schools, plus indexation, and for this to be the basic starting point of any new funding model resulting from the Review of Funding for Schooling process.

       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia had a record year in 2010 with 309 multiple organ donors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) activity in 2011 shows that Australia is on track to steadily sustain this improvement with 112 donors already this year;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) following the injection of $151 million by the Government to establish a coordinated approach to organ donation, 242 staff have now been appointed in 77 hospitals and DonateLife agencies across Australia, thus enabling all jurisdictions to work cooperatively to support sustained improvements in organ donation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) there were 931 transplants in 2010 and already there have been 327 transplants in 2011; and
       </p>

        (2) acknowledges:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the selfless act of all donor families who have supported new life for transplant recipients;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the introduction of a national protocol for donation after cardiac death that will ensure Australia maximises the number of organ donors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that many hospitals that have not previously donated organs and tissue are now undertaking this important role as a result of the extra funding and staffing that are available;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that the States and Territories reaffirmed their commitment to the reform agenda in February 2011, in particular the financing of increases in tissue typing, retrieval of organs and transplant surgery;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the success of the two advertising campaigns launched in May 2010 and February 2011; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the importance of continued input of community groups and non government organisations in raising awareness among the Australian community. (Notice given 30 May 2011.)
