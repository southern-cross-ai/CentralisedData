        <p>
         The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
          Digital Economy
         </a>
         has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians, in particular in emergency situations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In recent years the mobile phone carriers have significantly expanded their terrestrial mobile networks.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone_Hutchison_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Vodafone Hutchison Australia
         </a>
         claims its networks currently cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus claims its 3G network provides services to 97 per cent of the Australian population. Telstra claims its
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_G" rel="nofollow">
          Next G
         </a>
         network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For the most part the recent extension of mobile coverage across Australia has been based on commercial decisions by carriers. In making a decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Local governments can assist in identifying potential demand for mobile services in the area. Information such as projections of population growth, visitors to the region and records of traffic volumes can be helpful in assisting carriers to make informed decisions about whether to extend coverage to certain areas.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There are a number of factors that can interfere with mobile reception and, therefore, affect a user's ability to obtain or maintain a mobile phone signal at any given time or in any particular place. These factors include mountainous or hilly terrain, road cuttings, buildings and tunnels. While not all potential sources of interference can be overcome, service providers should be able to advise of ways to minimise interference.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I understand there is unreliable mobile phone reception in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green_Bay_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Bowling Green Bay National Park
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In areas where no terrestrial mobile coverage exists, satellite mobile phones provide an alternative means of accessing communications. Satellite phones are not as reliant on the local power supply infrastructure and are more reliable than ground based systems during an emergency. Satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and are available from a number of providers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Residents of Alligator Creek may be eligible to apply for a subsidy under the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme. The scheme improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage or up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend more than 180 days across a two year period in non-coverage areas.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Under the scheme's rules, those eligible to apply include individuals, small businesses, community groups, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous corporations, emergency service organisations, health organisations and educational institutions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Information on the scheme is available from the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy website at www.dbcde.gov.au/satphone. An information kit can be obtained by contacting the scheme administrator on 1800 674 058 or via email at satphone@dbcde.gov.au.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         An alternative to telephone communications is the use of distress beacon units, such as Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPIRB" rel="nofollow">
          EPIRB
         </a>
         s) or Personal Locator Beacons (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLB" rel="nofollow">
          PLB
         </a>
         s). These devices are designed to assist in an emergency by alerting rescue authorities and indicating location. More recent models in corporate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_Satellite" rel="nofollow">
          Global Positioning Satellite

         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS" rel="nofollow">
          GPS
         </a>
         ) technology, enabling much more accurate determination of the location compared with earlier models.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These devices are not as limited by terrain as mobile phones and, by providing the location, will speed up any rescue effort. A variety of providers around Australia offer these for sale or hire.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Other technologies that could operate in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage include

          UHF

         ) radio. It is important to be aware that these technologies cannot connect to the telephone network.
