       <p>
        At every stage, from the moment a child is born, all a parent wants to do is to raise their child well, to teach them right and to watch them grow into their potential, whatever that may be. Tangney is home to many hardworking families, each of whom will benefit under this government and its desire to deliver for all Australians. I'm so proud to stand in this House, excited about a positive change through the passing of the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Improvements for Families and Gender Equality) Bill 2022 in the Senate. This is such a welcome development for growing families. It is hard raising a young family. I have had multiple careers in my life, and my wife and I have had to face many challenges. We brought up three children during a time when parental leave did not even exist. The challenges of looking after a small child are not lost on any parent. We all have sleepless nights. We cannot overlook the critical role that paid parental leave plays in supporting families during this special time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This legislation ensures that parents can access paid parental leave more easily, allowing them to spend more time bonding with their newborn child and less time worrying about how they will make ends meet. This bill also recognises that both parents have a role to play in raising children and provides for greater flexibility in the use of paid parental leave entitlements. This is a critical step forward in our efforts to promote gender equality and ensure that all parents are able to take an active role in the early years of their child's life. My constituents are already very excited at the prospect of being able to have access to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a part of Labor's commitment to support Australian families with the cost of living. I'm proud to be part of a government that is committed to supporting families and that recognises the importance of paid parental leave in achieving this goal. I want to commend Minister Rishworth for listening to the concerns of parents across the country. The minister has acted decisively to make the changes necessary to provide the support that parents need. In conclusion, I want to say thank you to all my colleagues who worked so hard to make this legislation a reality. Together we have made a positive difference in the lives of families across Australia.
