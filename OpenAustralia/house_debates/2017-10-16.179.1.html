       <p>
        I am incredibly proud of the vital work done by the Bubup Wilam Aboriginal Child and Family Centre in my electorate, in the suburb of Thomastown. I have spoken about their work on many occasions. The work that Lisa Thorpe, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Tony McCartney, president of the board, and all the team there do is simply inspirational. It is making a real difference for so many Aboriginal children and their families. I was incredibly privileged to be part of an important day on Friday to mark a partnership between Bubup Wilam and the Eastern Melbourne Primary Health Network. Indeed, I was delighted to welcome a government minister to the Scullin electorateâ€”a very rare privilege, as you may well appreciate, Deputy Speaker Claydon. It was great to have Minister Wyatt, the Minister for Indigenous Health, there to see the work that Bubup is doing and to see what's at stake if we don't keep this incredible and innovative service going.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the service has been focused on early education, it is genuinely a wraparound service and gathering place for local Aboriginal people. So it was terrific to see the health benefits recognised and supported by over $840,000 worth of investment. I welcome that investment and I congratulate the advocacy of all involved in Bubup as well as the primary health network for making it happen. I resolve to continue to fight for more funding to secure the future of Bubup and the future of all Indigenous people in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.
