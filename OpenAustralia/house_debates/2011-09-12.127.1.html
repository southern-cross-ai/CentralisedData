        I rise this morning to discuss a number of important associated issues in my electorate of Greenway—namely, the drive by locals to clean up
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Seven Hills
        </a>
        ; the community opposition to a new bottle shop opening in Seven Hills'
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalor_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Lalor Park
        </a>
        ; and, finally, the developments at the St Abanoub Coptic Youth Centre in Blacktown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year I joined concerned Seven Hills resident Mr Duncan Wyatt to launch a campaign to help clean up Seven Hills. There has been clear feedback from my constant interactions with local residents that the behaviour of some individuals is letting us all down and that we need to take collective action to address this. I grew up in Seven Hills and it is where I chose to place my electorate office, so I am passionate about making it better. I have seen many changes over many decades, such as the number of knock-down rebuilds with older houses being converted to new. The train station now has one of the highest patronages on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Line" rel="nofollow">
         Western Line
        </a>
        , and it has one of the biggest car-parking facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I, like many local residents, have seen Seven Hills develop in both positive and negative ways. In my time as local member, a large number of these residents have raised concerns with me about the need to address antisocial behaviour in and around Seven Hills. This includes making Boomerang Place—which faces onto Seven Hills railway station—an alcohol-free zone, stopping the illegal dumping of rubbish outside the St Vincent de Paul Centre in Best Road and increasing police patrols in the area. Only last week on my way to work I drove past
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vinnie's" rel="nofollow">
         Saint Vinnie's
        </a>
        and I, like many local residents, was disgusted to see the entire shopfront on Best Road littered with unusable rubbish—it was nothing more than rubbish, not donations. There was broken furniture, discarded clothes and busted appliances. There was nothing which could be used by the many frustrated volunteers inside who told me how fed up they are with such uncharitable behaviour.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the other major concerns raised with me is antisocial behaviour, mainly fuelled by alcohol, around Seven Hills station. By making Boomerang Place an alcohol-free zone, I am confident we can do something to curb the antisocial problems that are fuelled by alcohol. Families should not have to be worried about coming to Boomerang Place and enjoying other parts of Seven Hills. Business owners should be able to operate their businesses without being hounded by intoxicated people loitering around shopfronts in the middle of the day. In response to this issue I have received over 200 returned petitions which I will present to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blacktown City Council
        </a>
        for further action, including action by other agencies in cooperation with the Blacktown City Council, such as the Blacktown Local Area Command. I thank both Superintendent Mark Wright for his responsiveness to the concerns and the very constructive suggestions of many local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the neighbouring suburb of Lalor Park residents and community leaders have banded together to object to a proposal to open a bottle shop on Johnson Avenue. Many residents fear that this will contribute to an increase in alcohol fuelled violence in the area and encourage underage drinking, particularly because of the proposed bottle shop's close proximity to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Hills_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Seven Hills High School
        </a>
        . I also note its close proximity to Vardy's Road Public School. On 11 August, I attended a community meeting organised by local residents, including Petta Hines, to discuss the proposed bottle shop. The meeting was well attended by members of the community, including representatives from Blacktown police, local councillors, business owners and residents. It is instructive to note that the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics reports that Lalor Park is unfortunately considered a hot spot for alcohol related assaults. As we wait for the New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing to rule on the application, I commend the work of Petta and her fellow community leaders such as Danielle Rawlinson-Galistan and Linda Swan for all their hard work and commitment in ensuring local residents stay informed on this important issue. Danielle has been instrumental in organising and executing much public art in Lalor Park in the form of murals that have dramatically contributed to a decrease in vandalism and graffiti.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I congratulate Greenway's Coptic community and specifically the Saint Abanoub and the Holy Apostles Coptic Orthodox Church in Blacktown on the recent opening of their youth centre. The centre, which will cater to all young people in Blacktown, will include gym and sport facilities, art and crafts, music and tuition rooms as well as spiritual and counselling services. I note that the services provided are non-denominational and that many African youths use this service. With over 75,000 people under 14 years old in Blacktown, this is a development of great importance. It will provide an outlet for Blacktown's youths to express themselves and spend time in a safe and constructive environment. I thank the Saint Abanoub church and specifically Wasim Elmasri for the hard work in delivering this centre for our young people.
