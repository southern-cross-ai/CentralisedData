        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the committee's first report of 2015, addressing referrals made in October 2014.

        considers two referrals received in October by the committee from the

         Department of Defence
        </a>
        . The total estimated cost of these referrals is $865 million excluding

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The first referral was for the proposed Project
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR" rel="nofollow">
         AIR
        </a>
        7000 Phase 2B—Maritime Patrol Aircraft Replacement Project, something I know the member for Batman is very interested in. The estimated cost of the project is $707.9 million. The Department of Defence sought approval from the committee to provide facilities, infrastructure and airfield work for the introduction of new Boeing P8A Poseidon aircraft. Replacing the ageing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP" rel="nofollow">
         AP
        </a>
        3C Orion fleet with P8A Poseidon aircraft will enhance the range and endurance of Australia's maritime surveillance. It will also provide an effective anti-submarine and anti-surface-warfare capability, very important when Australia has responsibility for 11 per cent of the earth's surface. The works would be undertaken at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Edinburgh in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , and designated forward-operating bases will be at RAAF Bases Darwin, Pearce and Townsville, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and Queensland respectively. Minor works will also be undertaken at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Stirling
        </i>
        in Western Australia. New maintenance hangars at RAAF Bases Edinburgh and Darwin are required to operate and maintain these new aircraft. Additionally, the P8A aircraft is wider and heavier than the AP3C Orion and will be more demanding and potentially damaging on aircraft pavements. Upgrades including strengthening of existing pavements and runway lengthening to a number of RAAF and joint-user airfields are required. The committee held a briefing and inspection at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Edinburgh
        </a>
        , before conducting both public and confidential hearings in Adelaide. The committee heard that the proposed works will assist in protecting Australia's national interest in terms of security. During the hearing, the committee noted that some existing buildings may have high heritage ratings. Defence assured the committee that these buildings are not located on the same footprint as the proposed facilities and that, as such, the projects can be delivered irrespective of the outcomes of further heritage assessments. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in October 2015 at RAAF Base Edinburgh and HMAS
        <i>
         Stirling
        </i>
        . Works at the forward-operating bases are planned to commence in 2018, but may be delivered earlier if funding is available. All works are expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost, and recommends that the project proceed.
       </p>

        The second referral was for the proposed Project AIR9000 Phase 7—Helicopter Aircrew Training System (HATS) Facilities Project. The estimated cost of this project is $157.1 million, excluding GST. The Department of Defence sought approval from the committee to provide facilities, at HMAS
        <i>

        </i>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervis_Bay_Airfield" rel="nofollow">
         Jervis Bay Airfield
        </a>
        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , which can deliver helicopter training in a safe and modern environment. Defence informed the committee that the government is acquiring advanced, new-generation naval combat and battlefield helicopters. Consequently, an upgrade to the introductory helicopter training system is required to ensure aircrew are adequately trained to operate these helicopters. This training will use a combination of live and synthetic training experiences on both modern twin-engine helicopters and flight simulators. The committee conducted an inspection of HMAS
        <i>
         Albatross
        </i>
        in Nowra, New South Wales, where we observed the very outdated training systems firsthand. Following this, the committee held both public and confidential hearings. The committee heard that the project will generate short-term local employment, predominantly in the building, construction and unskilled labour markets. Defence advised that there would be minimal disruption to the local community, and that there are no known heritage issues associated with the project. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the chosen sites will have the synthetic training facility completed by late 2016, with installation of the full flight simulators beginning in August 2016. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost, and recommends that the project proceed.

        Before concluding, I would also like to thank the staff at RAAF Base Edinburgh particularly, for taking me on a slight detour when we were there to look at the memorial marking the death of Flight Lieutenant Glenn Kemshall Donovan, 14 March 1958 to 12 March 1990, who was killed in an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARDU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Nomad aircraft crash near Mallala in South Australia. While I did not know Glenn Donovan, he was a very good friend of my wife's. When I was there, I was able to collect some seeds from the tree that he had nurtured, and that was planted by his parents, a
        <i>
         Eucalyptus leucoxylon
        </i>
        'rosea', which I have taken and planted in my own yard.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding today, I would remark that the committee looks forward to another productive year ahead, and I commend the report to the House.
