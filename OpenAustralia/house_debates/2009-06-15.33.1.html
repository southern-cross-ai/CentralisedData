        My question is to the Minister for Education. Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister’s comments on 3 February about the school stimulus package when he said, ‘This government will adopt a zero tolerance approach to any state government, whatever its political complexion to any substitution of effort,’ and, if so, what action will the government take against the

        <p>
         Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and once again, because we do not have accurate questions from the shadow minister for education, I will check what he has asserted, because we know from former question times that assertions made by the opposition about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Building the Education Revolution
         </a>
         and about the government’s education policies generally turn out to be completely spurious when investigated.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I can say to the shadow minister—and he may or may not be interested because the degree of seriousness with which he takes his education work is always something to be doubted—is that the government is absolutely determined that the Building the Education Revolution program is an addition to investment that would have happened in any event as a result of state budgets. We work constantly with our state and territory colleagues to deliver that program. The sanctions that can be applied under the agreements that surround the Building the Education Revolution program are serious ones and they are understood by our state and territory colleagues.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was specifically in relation to the cut of 12 per cent to the capital works program in the

           <p>
            I certainly will investigate the claims made. But, given the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has risen to her feet to once again indicate an interest in education, I will take the opportunity to remind the House that, when she was minister for education, we did have a problem with funding going to schools that were closing. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the Investing in Our Schools Program grant she made to the Bowral Rudolf Steiner School in 2007, when it closed in 2007. There is the grant that she made to the Marist College Rosalie School in 2008, when it closed in 2008.

                    is an economic stimulus package. It is to go on top of other expenditures. I will investigate the claims made, but I make this very simple point: from an opposition that opposed this program lock, stock and barrel, under whose administration not one school would get one cent, it seems to me pretty interesting that they come in here day after day with claims that, when investigated, turn out to be fabricated. On the track record of the opposition when it was in government and the track record of those who held the education portfolio, let us just contemplate for a moment what, if any, lasting reforms people will be talking about from the Howard era. Can’t think of one? Well, there would be a good reason for that.
