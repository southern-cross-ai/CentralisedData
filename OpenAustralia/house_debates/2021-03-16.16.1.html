        One of the great congestion-busting initiatives in my electorate—in fact, on the border of my electorate and the great electorate of Boothby—is the Fullarton Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road" rel="nofollow">

        intersection, in which the Commonwealth and state governments are jointly investing $61 million to ensure that we're helping people to get where they need to get, more quickly and more safely. However, one concerning component of this project was going to be the demolition of a very historic building in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        known as the Waite Gatehouse, on the famous Waite estate, which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Waite" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Waite
        </a>
        left to the people of South Australia when he passed away almost a century ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Happily, I welcome yesterday's announcement that the gatehouse is, in fact, going to be saved and is going to be relocated on the Waite site. This was something that had caused a lot of consternation to local residents in my electorate and those in nearby suburbs. It was not because the project isn't supported—it's an excellent project, and everyone wants to see that intersection upgraded—but there was a lot of local community concern about losing that very important and historic local heritage asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'm pleased that the University of Adelaide and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        government were able to announce yesterday that they have agreed to relocate this building. It will go to a more appropriate place, nowhere near the intersection. It's a great outcome, and I congratulate the local community for making their voices heard.
