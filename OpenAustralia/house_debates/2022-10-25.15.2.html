        On behalf of the Nationals, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Paul Davey AM. Paul came to Australia as a ten-pound Pom, sailing into Sydney on 19 April 1966. The very next day he caught a train to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        . After a few odd jobs, Paul settled as a journalist and worked for a range of outlets, both here and abroad, before going to work for the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Country Party
        </a>
        . From 1978 to 2000 he held a range of senior roles within the

         New South Wales
        </a>
        and federal Nationals. In 1983 Paul was appointed federal director and served for nearly a decadeâ€”our longest serving federal director to date. During his time as director he worked with five leaders:

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul Davey also held the history of the Nationals in his hand and protected it fiercely. He wrote eight books on the Nationals, including one of his final publications,
        <i>
         Milestone: A Century of Achievement
        </i>
        , which has become a bible to each one of us here today. He was made a life member of the Nationals in 2002 and was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia in January 2019. Earlier this year Paul was awarded our highest award, the Earle Page Meritorious Service Award, for his service to the party, which was accepted on behalf of the family by his daughter Senator Perin Davey.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amongst everything he gave to the Nationals, Paul was also father to Jim, Perin and Chick; grandfather to their children; and husband to Lindie. Our thoughts are with the family during this time. Vale Paul Davey AM.
