        I move amendment (1) as circulated in my name:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 6), after item 29, insert:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        29A At the end of paragraph 132(6)(b)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Add “and”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        29B Paragraph 132(6)(c)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Repeal the paragraph.

        commend the government for introducing this bill. It is a welcome move. It will implement into Australian law a number of important provisions in the Maritime Labour Convention. They are, as has been described, a bill of rights for seafarers. They will extend some important rights and protections for those working in the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of those important rights is the right to get medical care, as has been mentioned previously in the debate. However, the Greens see that there is no reason to impose a minimum qualifying period of seven days, as is set out in the bill, before medical care is to be made available. It is not something that is required in the convention. It is not something that would be a common standard in society, and one could readily imagine instances in which someone would be ill for a period of fewer than seven days but nonetheless be deserving of protection. On that basis we move the small amendment that has been circulated in my name. I thank the

        for drawing this to my attention. I commend the amendment to the House.

         The member for Melbourne has moved an amendment to repeal paragraph 132(6)(c) of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Navigation Act
         </a>
         . Currently, a seafarer is able to access sick leave only if he or she is so unwell that he or she will be unable to work for more than a week. The amendment will allow seafarers to access sick leave on the same basis as other workers, irrespective of the period of time they are unwell. The government supports this reasonable amendment which has been moved by the member for Melbourne. This adds, in a small way, to the bill that has been moved before the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill is an important step forward. There has never been so much legislation on shipping as there has been in recent years. The government is absolutely determined to revitalise the Australian shipping industry. We need to become a shipping nation, not just a shipper nation. We need to become participants, not just consumers. As the largest inhabited island continent on the planet, we have a vital interest in having a revitalised Australian shipping industry. This bill, bringing in the Maritime Labour Convention in the way that it does, is a part of the reform process. Later on, I will be bringing substantial legislation before the parliament for our national shipping reforms. I hope to receive the support of everyone in the House to have a revitalised Australian shipping industry in the interests of our economy, in the interests of a sustainable environment but also in the interests of our national security. I commend the bill to the House.
