        My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer update the House on any recently initiated actions regarding cartel conduct in the construction industry?

        <p class="italic">
         "The CFMMEU and Mr O’Mara are each charged with attempting to induce suppliers of steelfixing services and scaffolding services to reach cartel contracts, arrangements or understandings containing cartel provisions in relation to services provided to builders in the ACT in 2012 to 2013" …

         I am reading from the ACCC's media statement. I'd be happy to table it for you in a written form. You may want to read it; you may want to be advised of it. What does it take for the Labor Party to stop taking money from the CFMMEU? Some $2.4 million in donations have been funnelled to the Labor Party under this Leader of the Opposition, and some $11 million or thereabouts over their period of time. What does it take for the Labor Party to say to the CFMMEU: 'No more money for us. We're over your criminal and corrupt and thuggish and bullish conduct'? They've got to stop giving awards to these thugs and they should be supporting the government in ensuring they're prosecuted by the courts. This is a Labor leader who is so weak-kneed when it comes to the union movement, he makes Dan Andrews look like a corruption fighter—

            I want to rule on the point of order. I've got to say that, as I was listening to the answer, I was becoming concerned. The
            <i>
             Practice
            </i>
            writes up the approach to sub judice, and there's a scale, depending on whether something's before the court, whether there's a jury and what stage it's at. I'm not aware of, obviously, all of the details of every case and what stages they're at, but certainly, when it comes to criminal matters, the
            <i>
             Practice
            </i>
            makes it very clear that those matters are more high risk. I've just cautioned the Treasurer because there's a long history on the sub judice rule on these matters.

            <p>
             Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I agree, obviously, with your ruling because the Labor Party seems to think that this is the only matter the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
              CFMEU
             </a>

My comments in relation to the broader activities and the other activities of the CFMEU should have been reason enough for the Labor Party to turn its back on that thuggish bunch of crooks that occupy the CFMEU. But, instead of doing that, what this mob over there do is they move their wheelbarrow into the money!

                 <i>
                  Practice
                 </i>
