        I rise to show respect for National Police Remembrance Day. Since 1989, National Police Remembrance Day has been held on or near 29 September each year. This date is significant as it coincides with the feast day of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael" rel="nofollow">
         St Michael
        </a>
        , the patron saint of police officers. As we know, on a daily basis police officers risk their lives in the name of the community and the safety of individuals. In discharging their duties some of our police officers have given the ultimate sacrifice, their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1998, as a response to the murders of Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rod Miller, Blue Ribbon Day was born. On 29 September or as close as possible every year, in each state and territory police jurisdiction across Australia and the South-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         West Pacific
        </a>
        region, Blue Ribbon Day coincides with Police Remembrance Day, not only to remember those killed while on duty but also to show strong community support for all police around the world. Law and order are the cornerstones of the society we live in, operating in tandem with this very parliament and all others in Australia. Without a body to ensure that laws are followed, they become totally ineffectual.

        Last year I attended the south-west district Police Remembrance Day ceremony in Bunbury, in my electorate of Forrest. The

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APM" rel="nofollow">

        , and Pastor Keith Carmody and Reverend Mike Mateljan from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WA_Police" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        were in attendance at the ceremony, which provided those present with the opportunity to publicly remember officers and reflect on the sacrifices they have made while serving the community. It was also the opportunity for police officers present to pause and honour fallen colleagues, from both state and federal police services, whose lives have been cut short while performing their duty as police officers.

        Since 1834, 90
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        police officers and aides have fallen, of whom 10 were killed in the course of duty. I welcome every measure that will assist the effectiveness of WA Police, and benefit the WA population, as well as our national police. But no measure can help the officers who have died or the families of officers who have already given their lives in the name of law and order and for the protection of our communities. I offer my most sincere respect to their memories and my sympathy to the families whose loved ones were lost while dedicating their lives to keeping our communities safe.
