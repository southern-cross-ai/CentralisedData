       <p>
        I wish to record my congratulations to Mrs Gwen Braga on her re-election as Queensland President of Meals on Wheels. Just a few weeks ago I said in my first speech that ‘it is by empowering the individual that we will unlock the real potential of our society’. Like many volunteers in Ryan, Gwen has enriched the community through her dedication and hard work. It has become abundantly clear over many years that touching and improving the lives of others is a personal mission for Gwen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meals on Wheels sees thousands of elderly residents from every corner of our nation receive a nutritious meal organised and delivered by 14,000 volunteers across Queensland alone. They help the elderly to live healthy and independent lives, and since its beginning in 1956 it has developed into so much more. The volunteers provide personal contact with their clients and also check on their wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gwen has always said it was volunteering for this organisation, along with her mother’s involvement previously, that opened her eyes to people in need within the community. This spirit of compassion and helping those in need is one that epitomises so many community and volunteer groups in Ryan. Gwen has the respect of so many within our community as a volunteer for Meals on Wheels for more than 16 years as well as for her involvement in the Indooroopilly senior citizens group.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are all part of a community and some are involved more than others. But we should all be inspired by Gwen and take up the challenge to contribute to our community in the best way we each can. To say the least, Gwen has made a difference, and I urge others to follow her lead and the example she has set.
