        This Australia Day, once again, those who go above and beyond in their contributions to our community were recognised with Order of Australia awards. Emeritus Professor Russell Duncan Lansbury became an

        for his distinguished service to industrial relations education as an academic, notably at the

         University of Sydney
        </a>
        . His contribution spanned across research and authorship, to contributions to international arbitration foundations, all the way to mentoring young academics. The professor also volunteers at the

        Mrs Dorothy May Isaksen became a

         Member of the Order of Australia

         Parliament of New South Wales
        </a>
        , as an advocate for gender equality in politics, as a mentor and to the community at large. While we may not have been on the same side of politics, it is an honour to recognise Dorothy for her truly lifelong commitment to public service through politics. In the community, Dorothy has shown a willingness to get involved and contribute beyond the spotlight. Notably, I would like to recognise her work with the Manly Warringah Women's Resource Centre and the war widows.
       </p>

        Ms Catherine Anne Butler received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        for being a tireless advocate for refugees, for continuing to do an incredible job supporting the local Tibetan community and for her work on multicultural services in community health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Peter William Crombie was recognised with a Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to athletics. A competitive and distinguished sprinter himself, he has dedicated his energy to giving back to the athletics community. Having worked with Peter to secure funding for our local Narrabeen athletics track, I know how passionate he is about the sport.
       </p>

        Mr Angus Donald Gordon received a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to environmental management and planning and to the community. Angus is a member of the coastal expert panel advising the New South Wales Minister for Planning. At the

        Reverend Ivan Alexander Roberts was recognised with a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the

       </p>

        Thank you, on behalf of our community, for your service and for choosing to dedicate yourselves to a greater cause.
