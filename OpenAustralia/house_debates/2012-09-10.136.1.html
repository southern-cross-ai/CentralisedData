        I was delighted to attend on the weekend the Biggera Waters school fete in the great electorate of Fadden. The fete is the school's largest single fundraiser and is held biannually. It was wonderful to see hundreds and hundreds of people turn up, children in tow, and show their support for their local school and get involved. Not only was it a picture perfect

        day; the community pride and spirit displayed at this event was also picture perfect. I was proud to be a part of this school's festivities. To see the P&amp;C, parents, friends, students and wider community don their caps, sunscreen and broadest smiles to come along and show their support was fantastic. It epitomised all that we talk about when we mention community and school pride. Like everyone, I marvelled at the amazing school choirs and the performances on stage by the various school classes and at the great work that was being shown by the students. They gave everything to entertain their community and show off their special abilities and talents to friends and families alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were over 100 volunteer support people who helped make the 2012 Biggera Waters State School fete the success that it was, and I commend each and every one of them. I applaud their commitment and dedication in helping to make their child's school the very best that it can be. My heartfelt thanks go out to the fete's executive and to the P&amp;C, who worked tirelessly to ensure this great day was a success not only in fundraising for the school, which was its main aim, but also for the community spirit it encouraged. These wonderful people put in so much of their time, from the initial planning to arriving at 5 am to set up the marquees, the cake stalls and the myriad rides, attractions and events that go into making a really great school fete.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst it is always difficult to mention a hundred people in the House, I do need to make special mention of the P&amp;C executive, which was responsible for this wonderful day: Kim Buckley, the P&amp;C president; Anthea Donovan, the P&amp;C secretary; Carol Masters, P&amp;C vice-president; Christie Camelleri, the P&amp;C treasurer; Christie Turner, the fete convenor; and Rob Denny. Thank you also to the Biggera Waters State School administration team and the tireless teachers, who have worked so hard.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also commend the principal, Val Faulks, for all of her great work. Seeing her rise up from personal tragedy within her family to lead her school once more for this event was a wonderful thing. Thank you to Rachel Blond, the junior school deputy principal, and Karen Thomason, the senior school deputy principal, for supporting the P&amp;C and for her commitment to making this event a great success.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to be invited, and to take part in the day by donating a $1,000

        voucher to the P&amp;C to be raffled. It was also wonderful to be able to provide up to 30 of the marquees to help provide the coverage and shade that was so desperately needed. It is always great to be able to kick in financially to help schools get what they need. I do hope the raffle was a great success.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the wider school community and all those within it: thank you for generously giving up your time and effort to make your school and community a better place. Without such passionate individuals who work so hard, without the volunteers and without the parents, friends, families, colleagues, schoolkids and students, an event of this scale would not be possible. On behalf of the Fadden community of the northern Gold Coast: thank you for the richness that you put into your area and for the richness you put into your school. Congratulations on an outstanding success. You stand tall as an inspiration of what communities can do when they link hands and search for a common goal.
