       <p>
        On behalf of the federal coalition I can advise the House we will be supporting the Agriculture Legislation Amendment (Modernising Administrative Processes) Bill 2024. Overall, it has our support because we believe the amendments outlined in this legislation are sensible, responsible and practical.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will help ensure the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 is modernised, upgraded and fit for purpose while also repealing an act that is no longer needed. From the outset, when it comes to the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989, it's important to recognise the major role it has within the Australian primary production sector. The purpose of this act is to authorise and regulate four of our rural research and development corporationsâ€”or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDC" rel="nofollow">
         RDC
        </a>
        s, as they're known. For more than three decades, the RDCs, which include fisheries, cotton, grain and agrifutures, have driven forward evidence based innovation, boosted strategic partnerships and helped secure targeted investments in each of their respective industries. They allow the federal government and primary producers to co-invest in collective efforts to benefit not just the entire industry but many communities throughout rural, regional and remote Australia. Therefore, it's essential our RDCs operate as effectively as possible, and the measures in this bill will help do this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Significantly, this legislation will enhance the operation of the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 by improving the efficiency and administrative processes which relate to its governance and appointments. Specific amendments include streamlining and clarifying the nomination of RDC board members by a selection committee, which are then recommended to the minister for agriculture. It also removes the requirement for an annual report to be provided to the minister if no activity has been undertaken by the selection committee, acknowledging the RDC meet twice annually. This bill will remove the requirement for the four statutory RDC chairpersons to have a coordination meeting each year. The coalition believes this is a sensible change.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second major component of this bill includes repealing the outdated Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and making transitional provisions to allow information and documents held by the rural adjustment authority advisory council to be provided to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry. Given the rule adjustment scheme ceased in 1997, all financial commitments were acquitted in 2000 and funding for the farm business improvement program ended in February 2008, repealing this act just makes sense.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the federal coalition supports this bill. We commend the bill to the House.

        Debate adjourned.
