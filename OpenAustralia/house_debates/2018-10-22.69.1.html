        I rise to acknowledge the entrepreneurial spirit of local year 9 student, Tanieka Booth-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNeill" rel="nofollow">
         McNeill
        </a>
        , who attends Springfield Central State High School. At the age of 14, she has won valuable mentorship opportunities and a $10,000 prize for her start-up business, Shielded Socks. Her creative business idea is centred around socks for high school students that inspire confidence and help them throughout the day by a colourful and positive message embroidered into the souls of the socks. As reported in the
        <i>
         Springfield News
        </i>
        , so far she has beaten eight finalists across Brisbane and she won the right to pitch her idea at the Brisbane finals this week by winning her school's shark tank competition in August earlier this year. She was also supported by the wonderful Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce, led by president Neil Coupland, with a backer from the chamber already committing $3,000 to get her socks into the marketplace. The first batch will be ready by the end of the year.

        It's also like to take the opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the tireless work and dedication of the Darra Community Group, led by Mr Brad Butcher. They recently held their 15th annual Darra Street Festival for our local community, almost two weeks ago, and I was delighted to help open it. Originally set up as an alternative to the Brisbane Ekka, this signature local event has grown in stature every year. Although the weather may have dampened crowds this year, Brad and his amazing team of volunteers did a terrific job. Congratulations to all involved, and I look forward to attending next year's event, even bigger and better.
