        I rise today to speak on Darwin's newest centenarian, Lillian Kym Salter, affectionately known as Kym. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Kim at the Pearl residential care facility where she lives. It was amazing to meet with her. I presented her with a card and some flowers. She is an amazing lady. Unfortunately, I was not able to be there on her actual birthday because I was here in parliament. Kym's birthday was on 23 November. She had a lovely morning tea with her family and friends and the residents and nursing staff at the Pearl facility. I am reliably told that there were lots of celebrations and they went down very well. Kym loves balloons, so there were lots of balloons in her rooms. Kym told me that the secret to a long life is to not drink alcohol and to eat plenty of beetroot—and the proof is in the pudding! So please, everyone, eat a lot of beetroot! It was wonderful to meet Kym. I would also like to put on record my thanks to the fantastic staff at the Pearl facility. They do a great job and it is a credit to them that the residents there are so happy—and I got to see that for myself. Happy birthday, Kym.
