       <p>
        Many townships in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        have very wonderful, deep and rich histories. The small towns of Wandong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathcote_Junction" rel="nofollow">
         Heathcote Junction
        </a>
        are definitely no exception. These towns were once host to terracotta brickworks, timber seasoning and a milling factory, with connections to the large logging settlements and vast horse-drawn tramway lines in the Mount Disappointment State Forest. The towns also have a remarkable history involving Victoria’s rail system, with the north-east line operation and a branch line from Heathcote Junction to Kilmore, Heathcote, Bendigo and Lancefield.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Wandong-Heathcote Junction Community Group acknowledged that so much of these towns’ rich history was never recorded or published. Therefore, they applied for a local history grant to collate and document this history through the production of a book. I particularly want to thank the secretary of the community group,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Allen Hall
        </a>
        , who was recently announced as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Shire" rel="nofollow">

        ’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Person of the Year
        </a>
        , for organising the book. I also want to thank the other members of the committee who have helped to put this book together and helped to deliver so much for the communities of Wandong and Heathcote Junction.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the past three years the committee members have gathered information. They have gathered photographs and interviewed many people, including many of the elders of the community, regarding their knowledge of historical events, and have now completed this new book. Much of the content of this book has never before been published. It has been written with the purpose of recording the social, industrial, agricultural and infrastructure history of Wandong, Clonbinane and Heathcote Junction. It begins with the known Aboriginal occupation of the 1830s and goes right through to the present day. It is also an opportunity to record and preserve the recollections, the experiences, of the district’s people over a long period of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next month the committee will launch the book, which is titled
        <i>
         Ghosts, Gold and a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Elephant" rel="nofollow">
          White Elephant
         </a>
        </i>
        . ‘Ghosts’ signifies the Aboriginal name for the area. ‘Gold’ signifies the goldmining industry that once existed in Clonbinane. The white elephant was a huge horsedrawn tramways bridge that could not be used when built in the Mount Disappointment State Forest. I recommend
        <i>
         Ghosts, Gold and a White Elephant
        </i>
        to anyone appreciative of historical stories and particularly of three of our oldest Victorian towns. It follows them from a bustling period in Victoria’s history, entering the 20th century, going through decades of stability from the mid-20th century and then experiencing a resurgence, as the locals believe the area is the only place to live in the 21st century. The towns’ history will now be preserved and published for future generations and for the general public, thanks to the efforts of these people. I congratulate everyone on the committee for their hard work, dedication and commitment.
