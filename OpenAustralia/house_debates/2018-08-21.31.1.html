       <p>
        The winter break was a great time to catch up with local companies that are going above and beyond in Bonner. One of these is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Brisbane" rel="nofollow">
         Port of Brisbane
        </a>
        company. Just recently, the Port of Brisbane recognised outstanding local organisations for their work in the community through a range of grants. They have also been working on a pilot project with the goal of improving safety across the entire road freight industry in Australia. The Port of Brisbane's annual Community Grants Program is a fantastic initiative. These grants are awarded to local and not-for-profit organisations for innovative projects that benefit the wider community.

        I want to thank Port of Brisbane
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Roy Cummins, for inviting me to their recent awards ceremony. It was an incredible event, bringing together an incredible group of people. Together, these people are making such a difference in our community, and it was great to meet them and hear about their work. Quite a few of them were familiar faces, and I wasn't surprised that their organisations were awarded grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of them was Nyree Mannion. Nyree started the Make it Home Safely initiative three years ago, to educate young people about safe driving. Their Port of Brisbane grant will go towards a new car to support Make it Home Safely's learn-to-drive program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Port of Brisbane is also working with the Queensland Trucking Association on another project to improve road safety. Their Heavy Vehicle Safety Around Ports project has just received federal funding through the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. The government is proud to support this program.
