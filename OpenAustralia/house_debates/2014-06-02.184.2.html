        I would like to commend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Council and Mayor Barry Longland for their plan to install 'Gasfield Free' signs at various locations throughout the Tweed Shire. They are encouraging community members to have their say online, and I have just voted yes online for this great initiative of the council's. As the mayor has said, installing these signs is an important step to send a clear message to gas operators that gas exploration is not welcome within the Tweed. I really support this initiative by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        If it is supported by the community, panels displaying the words 'Gasfield Free' will be added to new and existing welcome signs at the entrances to the Tweed Shire. There will also be panels added to township and village signs scattered across the entire shire. They will read: 'Tweed Shireâ€”Gasfield Free' and this will really be a reflection of the community sentiment. We do not want to have any coal-seam gas or unconventional gas mining on the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed councils consulted closely with Gasfield Free Northern Rivers and also with Lock the Gate Tweed in developing this fantastic plan for displaying these signs. I would also like to acknowledge that both Byron and Lismore shires have signs to the entrance of their shires as well, stating the fact that they are gasfield free. Indeed, this is the sentiment shared right throughout the North Coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . As a community we stand very united in wanting to make sure that we preserve our beautiful environment that we have there and that we maintain the fact that we are gasfield free. I really commend Tweed Shire Council for this initiative. I encourage locals, please, get online at yoursaytweed.com.au/gas and make your voice heard. Say yes to Tweed Shire Council. We want to have the signs that say 'Gasfield Free'.
