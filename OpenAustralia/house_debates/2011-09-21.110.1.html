       <p>
        I rise to inform the House that this week is Dementia Awareness Week, with today, 21 September, being World Alzheimer's Day. The theme of this year's awareness week is, 'Worried about your memory?' As one of the founding members of the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia, which has now been operating for eight years, I have followed closely the issues faced by those with dementia in our Australian communities, in particular those with Alzheimer's disease, as well as their families and their carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dementia was, and continues to be, a critical health issue of national significance. Today, Alzheimer's Australia and the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia hosted an event to raise awareness of the latest developments regarding dementia. The Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Ageing,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butler" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Butler
        </a>
        , addressed the group, as did

         Ita Buttrose

        , the new president of Alzheimer's Australia; Glenn Rees,

        of Alzheimer's Australia; and the keynote presenter, Professor John Breitner, one of the world's leading authorities on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. I particularly say a big welcome to Ita Buttrose, and thank her for taking on the role of president and adding her talents to a very worthy cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue Pieters-Hawke was also in attendance today. She is a long-time champion of those living with dementia. Her generosity and that of her mother,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazel_Hawke" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , in sharing their experience with dementia over a long period of time continues to encourage and inspire so many people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today the minister referred to two emerging epidemics in our country—diabetes and dementia—observing that the stigma and mythology often associated with dementia continues to pervade our nation's consciousness. Minister Butler raised the enormity of the challenge that dementia will present to the health and wellbeing of Australians in the future and expressed his willingness to work with Alzheimer's Australia in formulating the government's response to the recently released
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        report,

        <i>
         lder Australians
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        With 52 per cent of residents in aged care diagnosed with dementia, the minister stated that any aged care policy must have dementia at its centre. Access Economics estimates that over 269,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, with many facing longer than three years without diagnosis. Nationwide, this number continues to grow by 1,500 new cases each week. As the third leading cause of death in Australia, after heart disease and stroke, it is our duty to continue on our mission to raise the profile of dementia and increase awareness of its effects on individuals and communities, and to resource the research and interventions that will prevent dementia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Introducing the keynote speaker, Ita Buttrose referred to recent reports, one of which showed that developed countries achieve only a 20 to 50 per cent diagnosis rate. She also referred to a study undertaken at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
         University of Newcastle
        </a>
        showing an average time of three years after the first appointment with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        before the disease was diagnosed. That is, of course, very discouraging. But this data does support the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early diagnosis was the topic of Professor John Brietner's presentation. Outlining the global challenge, he predicted that by 2050, there will be over 115 million cases of dementia worldwide, with a cost of $2.3 trillion. Professor Brietner presented interesting research that went to the core challenges of early detection—from biomarker evidence to prevention—and arresting dementia symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst acknowledging the importance of behaviour and lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and what he describes as a 'Mediterranean diet instead of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
         McDonald's
        </a>
        diet', as well as the better managing of risk factors, his trials with anti-inflammatory medication and nasal insulin showed positive impacts at this stage of his research. His efforts to be with us today are very much appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a positive note, I draw the House's attention to the work of Novocastrian friends Dr Maggie Haertsch and her husband, trained clown doctor Jean-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bell" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Bell
        </a>
        , in what they call 'the smile study'—a study which investigated impacts of humour therapy on people with dementia. A documentary of the study
        <i>
         The Smile Within
        </i>
        will be shown at the National Dementia Research Forum in Sydney this week. Their study found a 20 per cent reduction in agitation when they used humour therapy—results that are comparable to the results achieved through the use of common dementia drugs. I commend their ongoing work to improve the quality of life of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CEO of Alzheimer's Australia, Glenn Rees, emphasised that early diagnosis of dementia can be achieved to assist in treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and to reduce the impacts. But this has to be done by refocusing the research. That is something that we certainly welcome and encourage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I close in expressing—with my co-convenor, the member for Brisbane—the support of the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia for all Australians impacted by dementia. I particularly note that Anne Kirchler and her partner Andrew Stenning from my region will have reached the summit of
