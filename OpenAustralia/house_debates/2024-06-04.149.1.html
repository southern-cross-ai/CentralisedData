        The last few months I've had the privilege of travelling around local schools in Bennelong to present leadership awards to their school leaders. I do these visits because I want to use my role as a member of parliament to help encourage our school leaders and all students to take up leadership opportunities when they can. Leadership is not merely about hiding a position of title; it's about serving others and making a positive difference in their lives. We need more leaders, so today I want to give a shout out to all the young leaders in Bennelong who are giving this a go.
