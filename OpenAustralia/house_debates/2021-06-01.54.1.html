         I thank the member for his question. He, like many other members on this side of the House, understands the full value of our $110 billion 10-year pipeline of investment in infrastructure. It's helping through the COVID recovery, and whilst we're a long way from being out of it yet, the work sites around the nation on our roads, on our bridges, on our rail and on our airports are making such a difference. The member for Cowper knows well what it means for improved road safety, particularly on regional roads, and the positive impact it has on regional communities such as the one he represents on the mid-

         . He is a former police officer and a former solicitor, and he is chair of the Joint Select Committee on

          Road Safety
         </a>
         . He understands how new and improved infrastructure on our roads saves lives. It really does. The member would also be aware of the works being delivered under our $3 billion safety package. Another billion dollars went into it in the 11 May budget. In the member's electorate of Cowper, works including new safety barriers, audio-tactile line markings, new pedestrian crossings, rumble strips and shoulder sealing are improving road usage for every person who is on those roads. Every parent's worst nightmare is the knock on their door by a first responder saying that a loved one is not coming home. Part of our Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, part of our Road Safety Program, is to avoid that if at all possible. The five councils in Cowper received $26.9 million towards the

         -Hastings Council has welcomed that investment. Her council received $8.9 million. She said:

        <p class="italic">
         Our population is continuously growing, and we've seen more young working families move to our region in the last year. Having more jobs available, and improving our community spaces is so important for us to stay social and healthy, especially for young peopleâ€”
        </p>
        <p>
         and especially, I would add, during the COVID-19 global pandemic. These projects are building resilience in communities such as Mayor Pinson's in the electorate of Cowper.

         yesterday I was pleased to unveil the new Freight Data Hub prototype website. That network will also help truckies, who've been magnificent during COVID. Let's make no mistake, let's say it how it is: they have been magnificent, delivering the goods and making sure that supermarket shelves get stocked, and, whether it's in Cowper, whether it's right across the country, we owe truckies a debt of gratitude. The heavy vehicle rest areas and their use is mapped as part of this hub, helping them to avoid congestion. It's part of the network that was very well received at that Western Sydney site yesterday, as it should be.
