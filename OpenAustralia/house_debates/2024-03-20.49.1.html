       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government understands that family budgets are tight and that the impact of cost-of-living pressures and inflation are being felt around kitchen tables across the country. That's why we want you, the Australian people, to earn more and keep more of what you earn. That's why Labor's tax cuts from 1 July will ensure every single Australian is getting a tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Wills, 78,000 people will receive a tax cut and 85 per cent of my electorate will receive a bigger tax cut under Labor's tax cuts. About 84 per cent of Australians around the country are getting a bigger tax cut under this government than they would have under the Liberals. Every working Australian will pay less tax on the first $45,000 they earn. Part-time workers earning $40,000 such as waitresses, retail workers and cashiers in grocery stores will get a tax cut. Under Morrison's tax plan, these people would have got absolutely nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as these cuts, the government has put in place a number of non-inflationary measures to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. We have and are rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief, rent assistance increases, energy bill rebates, cheaper medicines, increased income support, Medicare bulk-billing incentives and much more. Why? Because we care. We are providing this to Australians because we care about them and we're actually doing something about it.
