        It's crystal clear: jobs growth only happens under Labor. That's not my opinion. It's a fact. Did the Albanese Labor government promise more jobs? Yes, we did. One of Labor's key election commitments was to create more jobs. It pledged to address the skills shortage in industry and business. Did the Albanese Labor government deliver on that promise? Yes, we did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, the June labour force figures were released by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        . The June figures showed that there were 310,000 people in work in Perth's south-east region, which Swan sits in. This is an increase of 9,000 jobs compared to the same time last year. It's good news for my electorate of Swan, it's good news for Perth's entire south-east corridor and it's good news for the entire nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures revealed that the policies and investment of the Albanese Labor government are indeed working. This includes the national 18,000 fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        places on offer this year. Also, we had a $436 million investment in the foundation skills program. These are two examples of investment in Australia's future that were lacking under the previous government. They are not lacking under Labor. Labor is delivering on jobs and delivering on skills, and having more people in jobs in my region is testament to that.
