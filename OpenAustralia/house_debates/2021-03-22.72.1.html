       <p>
        My question is again to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm last Thursday after first telling the House, 'Those inquiries are being made by the secretary of my department,' he then in a subsequent answer said, 'This work is being done by the secretary of my department'? Can the Prime Minister further confirm that, in fact, no inquiries were being made and no work was being done on the Gaetjens inquiry? Can the Prime Minister confirm that he had known this for nine full days before he misled the parliament?

           the assertion that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. He has other forms in the House where he can pursue that, and he should seek to do so if that's what he wishes to do. The inquiry has been undertaken at arm's length, and I look forward to that inquiry being completed. You will have seen today in Senate estimates that the secretary, as I said he would be, was in attendance. He was in a position to answer questions in relation to the inquiry he is conducting. I look forward to that being done as quickly as it can be and being completed so a report can be provided. I advise the House that he has not provided me with a further update about when I might expect that report. That, indeed, was the case. There was no deadline or timetable available to me when I reported to the House.
          </p>
          <p>
           I've been very clear with this House about when I became aware of these matters that are the subject of the inquiry. I have been very clear about when I made those inquiries of my office.
