         I thank the member for Barker for that question. I acknowledge that his electorate has been the subject of two significant fires: one at Lamaroo and one near Bordertown. I thank him for keeping me informed about developments within his electorate over the past 24 hours. Like the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, we have all been shocked by the scale and the ferocity of the fires in

         yesterday. Fortunately, the fire perimeter has not expanded since midnight, but a watch-and-act warning remains in place. I spoke to my colleague,

         , just before question time and he has informed me that containment activities are expected to continue for several days, but the focus of South Australian authorities is now on bringing those fires under control. We in Australia know that bushfires are a feature of our environment, but the impact of these bushfires can be devastating, with loss of life, livelihoods and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is going to take us some time to get a complete picture about what impact this fire has had on the South Australian community but, as the House would be aware, the fires have resulted in at least two confirmed deaths. I offer the federal government's condolences to the families and to all of those affected. Whilst the damage is still being assessed, it is clear that the impacts of this fire are very widespread. At least 16 homes and 22 other buildings have been destroyed. Over 85,000 hectares of land has been affected, with substantial crop and livestock losses. Very sadly, there are reports of at least 19 injuries. Some of them are very serious.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the second time in recent weeks we are extremely grateful for our emergency services personnel, who are still working hard to bring this blaze under control. As well as highlighting the professionalism and dedication of South Australia's firefighters, yesterday showed the enormous strength of the national cooperation efforts, as both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition referred to in their contributions.

         has assisted and continues to assist with fire-mapping capabilities. Victoria have sent 50 strike teams, including 50 trucks and 200 personnel, to South Australia. They will commence operations from tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have also spoken to the member for Wakefield, Mr Nick Champion, Senator Sean Edwards and, as I have said, the member for Barker. I acknowledge that the electorate of the member for Wakefield, in particular, has been very severely affected by these fires in communities that he knows very well. He is out there working to alleviate community concern within bushfire affected areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under longstanding arrangements, the Commonwealth will assist the South Australian government with the recovery. These fires remind us all of the need to prepare for what is going to be a very difficult fire season. I would urge every Australian to proactively think through what they are going to do in the event of an emergency.
