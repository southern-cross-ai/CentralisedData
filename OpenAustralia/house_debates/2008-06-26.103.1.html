        On Sunday, I will be holding my second family fun day at Belmont, on the foreshores of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        . Last year’s family fun day was an outstanding success. It was a beautiful day. There was a lot of information available for families and there was a jumping castle, face painting and a free sausage sizzle. I am holding this family fun day in conjunction with the state member for Swansea,

        . The family fun day last year was such an outstanding success that we decided that we would hold another one this year. Unfortunately, we could not hold it within National Families Week, but we are holding it this Sunday. Family fun days are an opportunity to highlight the importance of families in our community and provide a lot of useful information to families. They provide a chance for families to get together and relax on the foreshore of beautiful Lake Macquarie. I am informed that it is going to be an outstanding day. It will be a sunny day, and for once it will not be raining.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we are there we can reflect on the importance of balancing work and family life, because these days families are under considerable pressure. It is interesting to note that Australia now has the longest working hours of all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        countries. Around a quarter of parents with children under the age of 15 are in full-time work. They are working an average of 50 hours a week. That means that families have a lot of pressure on them. I would encourage members on both sides of the House to hold family fun days, because they have been very successful in my electorate. There will be stalls from a number of the schools and preschools and an information stall from the family centre at the university. This morning I was told by my staff back in the electorate office that a local speech therapist came into the office and asked if she could bring along information on resources that are available for families within our local area. This is a time when families can do what families should do.
       </p>
       <p>
        The slogan for National Families Week this year was ‘Work and family: getting the balance right’ so it is appropriate to reflect on the number of hours that families are working. It is important to make an investment in family time and remember that an effective balance of work and family responsibilities makes for stronger families, stronger workplaces and stronger communities because it helps us to care effectively for our families. The family does not stop with mum and dad; it is also the grandparents. Last year a number of people brought along the grandparents, and it was a fantastic day. The family fun day encourages people to invest some time in celebrating the vital role of families. Robert Coombs and I believe that our joining together and showing leadership and commitment to families will improve the all-round physical and emotional wellbeing of the family unit.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this family fun day I will also be releasing my new support services document for families and children. That has been completed by the social work student, Mia, who has been on placement in the office. It will be an outstanding resource for people in the community, something that families can refer to on a daily basis if they are faced with a problem or if they are searching for information on one thing or another. I know that it will be a great success on Sunday. I know that families in the community will enjoy the day and I hope that they benefit from being able to obtain information whilst at the same time having fun.
