        My question is again to the Prime Minister. The

        </a>
        government says it was forced to take 'assertive action to clarify the responsibility of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth regulator' during the deadly COVID outbreak at Newmarch House. Why did the New South Wales government have to tell the Commonwealth to do its job and protect frail and vulnerable aged-care residents?

         The responsibilities of the Commonwealth have been well set out. I've set them out to this House on many occasions, and they're well understood. We're responsible for the regulation and funding of aged-care facilities, and that's why we continue to invest a billion dollars and more every year in our responsibilities to ensure that our elderly residents in our communities are looked after as best we possibly can in their homes or in those facilities themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those responsibilities are very clear. When there is an overlap with public health responsibilities, whether it's in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         or Victoria or any other placeâ€”we've worked also very constructively with the Queensland government when it comes to these matters. The Queensland government's response plan has proved also very effective, working with the federal government's plan. That has ensured that, in relation to outbreaks, we've been able to limit any further impact in those places. Our plan and our responsibilities are very clear. We will continue to fulfil those responsibilities with more than $1 billion every single year in support for the aged-care sector.
