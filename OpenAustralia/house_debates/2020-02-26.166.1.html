        Undoubtedly, one of the best parts of being elected to represent the amazing northern Tasmanian community is the opportunity to meet with those who are boldly trying to change the status quo when it comes to some challenges for our community. Such are the passionate advocates behind a long list of projects like Active Launceston, Healthy George Town and Healthy Hobart, the brainchild of local powerhouses and sisters Lucy Byrne and Penny Terry. Active Launceston was established over a decade ago. The project is a community driven partnership with the vision of improving the health and wellbeing of the Launceston community, reducing barriers and targeting those with the highest need. Though there is much to be proud of when it comes to northern Tasmania, our community does face challenges in the areas of healthy lifestyle and education.
       </p>
       <p>
        After seeing the success of Active Launceston, Lucy and Penny identified a deeper need for collaboration within the state to achieve long-term sustainable healthy outcomes, and their for-purpose company Healthy Tasmania was born. I was thrilled to launch the latest initiative, Healthy George Town, recently, which was a decade in the making. I first encountered the idea as a new councillor on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town_Council" rel="nofollow">
         George Town Council
        </a>
        in 2009 and worked with Lucy to achieve funding. I was determined to see this idea come to fruition, and, thanks to a joint funding agreement between the Morrison and state Liberal governments, it was finally made possible. As I said on the day, the launch of the program was one of the proudest moments in my career so far, despite the fact that I had to take on the new mayor in a planking competition! Recreational services are key to a liveable community, and the launch of Healthy George Town offers a great opportunity to this community. The program takes an evidence based approach to create healthy behaviours and is specifically adapted to the needs of our community and to all ages and abilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Active Launceston program is now in its twelfth year and its success is unique and unparalleled. The program is the last remaining project in the country funded through the 2008 activity and healthy communities grants program, and Active Launceston has provided a strong evidence based model that has been replicated in other rural and regional communities across Australia with success. Lucy and Penny's work demonstrates how health promotion and preventative health care can be done differently in this country and with better outcomes. Their model supports private and public organisations to work successfully in partnership to ensure the right people with the right skills do the right job and at the right time, ensuring an efficient, effective and sustainable use of public funds with real results. Well done, healthy Tasmania. I can't wait to see what you do next.
