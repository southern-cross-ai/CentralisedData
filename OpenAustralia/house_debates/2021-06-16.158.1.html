       <p>
        I rise tonight to speak about an amazing community organisation, which I proudly acknowledge as based in my electorate. It's an organisation that has become a beacon of hope for many people in my area and in Victoria—a Victoria which has been ravaged by bushfires, the COVID-19 pandemic and now flooding. This organisation has become synonymous with the essential Australian spirit of mateship and helping out those in need. I speak of course of Sikh Volunteers Australia. On
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        this year, Sikh Volunteers Australia was one of four local organisations to be awarded a 2021 Holt Australia Day Award, for their response in supporting families in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given their ongoing efforts, which continue even as I speak here, I think it's appropriate to continue to acknowledge them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to talk just a little about their extraordinary work and the inspiration that they provide to us all. During those awful bushfires in late 2019 and early 2020, amidst the trauma, the grief and the fear, Sikh Volunteers provided hope. Let me cite the words of a Victorian police officer whose job it was to evacuate those in the bushfire ravaged areas. He said: 'The community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
         East Gippsland
        </a>
        were significantly displaced during the fires, with emergency relief centres set up to provide assistance to displaced people. In my role as a police officer, knowing the devastation that the areas from Mallacoota to Bairnsdale had endured, to see the Sikh Volunteers on the ground providing hot meals to the community was a relief, knowing that the public and the emergency workers were being cared for in support of the emergency response.' He said, 'This makes me so proud, and demonstrates that each of us, no matter how small or insignificant we may feel, can do things to change people's lives through care and compassion.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Another example of the great works and feats of this group was experienced in the second lockdown in Melbourne last year, when 3,000 residents living in public housing estates in suburbs adjacent to the city were placed in hard lockdown. Sikh Volunteers again sprung into action. A team of 12 volunteers went with their vans to the towers situated in Kensington and Flemington to deliver over 1,000 much-needed meals a day. They serve vegetarian meals—for many, it was the first time in days they had been served a hot meal—and they continued to do so during the period of the lockdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sikh Volunteers believe that it is their duty to serve people when they need it the most. They understand that these people in the towers were very vulnerable, and that's why they went. They drove every day from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Meadows" rel="nofollow">
         Devon Meadows
        </a>
        , which is about 70 to 80 kilometres away, to provide their, help, support, food and hope. They did that also for the frontline staff who were supporting the residents. Imagine being a resident of those towers, under siege, and seeing these great community activists and people with delicious nutritious food—hot food—who were there to provide support for you.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, Sikh Volunteers drove over 70km to the towers. I looked at some of the stats on their website tonight, before I spoke. I was stunned to see that Sikh Volunteers Australia had delivered, in the period of time between 18 March and 31 December 2020, 142,600 free meals for the needy during the COVID-19 crisis support period. It's just unbelievable, and they're doing this out of a large kitchen at the Sikh Community Gurmat Centre in Devon Meadows. It's just absolutely amazing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, in the recent two-week lockdown from 28 May to 10 June, Sikh Volunteers have been providing countless free vegetarian home delivered meals for the elderly, for single mothers, for the self-isolated, for the unemployed, for international students, for the homeless and for those in need. And they were doing that on top of a service they've been running from 21 February, which services seven council areas, including: Casey, Frankston,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        , Dandenong, Cardinia, Kingston and Monash. This is an ongoing service each week to help those in need in those seven council areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will close by quoting that police officer I quoted before. He eloquently summarises what our community feels about these fine Australians. He said: 'The Sikh Volunteers Australia have personified the Aussie spirit, helping out our communities near and far during fire, floods, storms and COVID. When times get tough, this fine organisation stood up and still continuously stands up to this very day, and demonstrates the best of humanity in trying conditions. They provided meals to all, ensuring no-one goes without, providing for some a glimpse that in some uncertain times the spirit of kindness and compassion is very much alive. Disaster always brings out the very best in people. This organisation has earned itself a place in the heart and soul of this nation.' They certainly have, and I'm proud to speak about them in this House.
