        There can be very little in life that is more troubling than not knowing what happened to your father, to your mother—or indeed to both. So this evening I rise to present, on behalf of 1,295 Australians, a series of petitions calling on the Rudd Labor government to finance a search for the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Maru" rel="nofollow">
          Montevideo Maru
         </a>
        </i>
        . In 2003 I tabled a petition from 475 Australians that drew the attention of the House to the tragedy of the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        . The sinking of the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        is Australia’s worst maritime tragedy. There were 845 Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW" rel="nofollow">
         POW
        </a>
        s and around 208 civilians who died when the Japanese POW vessel was sunk as it sailed from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain" rel="nofollow">
         New Britain
        </a>
        to Japan. The ship, which was bearing no markings to show it was carrying prisoners of war, was sunk by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS" rel="nofollow">

        <i>

        , an American submarine, approximately 100 kilometres off the coast of Cape Luzon in the Philippines. I understand, and it is reputed, that an uncle of the former member for Brand,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Beazley
        </a>
        , was believed to have lost his life on the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        . Indeed, I am led to believe that a grandfather of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, was also believed to have perished aboard this ship.
       </p>
       <p>
        The three petitions that I will table in a moment include, as I said, the names of some 1,295 Australians who have banded together to call on the Rudd government to help finance this search. Cynthia Schmidt, the principal petitioner, has dedicated her life to trying to find out what happened to her father, to trying to find out what happened to the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        and ultimately, of course, to bring closure in this sense. I have certainly been very proud to support them in this ongoing campaign since I was elected in 2001. I know there are many members on both sides of the House who support them in their quest to have closure, who support them in their quest to know exactly what happened to the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        . When you look at the great sense of relief there was when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        was located and, for many people, the ability to pay their due respects, you can certainly understand that for those who lost their loved ones, for those who lost their fathers, with the sinking of the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        the ability to finally have closure will be a great sense of relief for them. In that vein, Mr Speaker, I table the petitions.
