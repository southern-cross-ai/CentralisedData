        I was honoured to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        Queensland aviation awards in Carrara, where I presented the national medals to

         Paul Gibson
        </a>
        ,

         David O'Brien
        </a>
        and Kurt Brumley. The national medal is Australia's most awarded civilian medal. It recognises long and diligent service by members of recognised government and voluntary organisations who risk their lives or safety to protect or assist the community in enforcement of the law or in times of emergency or natural disaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul Gibson was a corporal in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        from 1983 to 1993, where he served as a motor mechanic and a helicopter flight fitter. He joined Surf Life Saving in 2013 as Carrara Base Manager and HAAMC, and has been Chief Pilot since 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        David O'Brien was a captain in the Australian Defence Force. He completed his pilot's course and was posted to Darwin in 2007 and was then deployed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        in 2008. He joined Surf Life Saving in 2014 as a helicopter pilot on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        and is now Deputy Chief Pilot and Head of Training and Checking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kurt Brumley enlisted in the Australian Defence Force in 1995 and eventually became a corporal. He served on operations in Iraq and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        as well as domestic counterterrorist operations. In 2005 he was transferred to Army reserves after 10 years of full service. Kurt is currently a POLAIR pilot operating out of Archerfield and operates the Westpac rescue helicopters out of Carrara and Caloundra. Thank you to all of you for your selfless service. You should be incredibly proud.
