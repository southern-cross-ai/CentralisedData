        In contributing to this grievance debate, I wish to raise the importance of delivering more timely access to high-speed broadband internet services in developing the digital economy for our community. A number of constituents have contacted me in recent months to express their concern at the lack of access to internet services at an adequate bandwidth and speed in certain locations. Currently, a number of homes located in the older, more established suburbs within my electorate of Moore, including Craigie, Duncraig, Edgewater, Joondalup, Padbury, Marmion, Kingsley and Woodvale, have inadequate access to broadband internet services. Members of the community have informed me that they require sufficient bandwidth for running their businesses, for completing their education and for home entertainment. The timely provision of this essential telecommunications infrastructure will help develop and build the digital economy by connecting people in residential and business settings with access to information, services and networks on a global scale. There exists an urgent and compelling need to upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure by implementing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        in a more timely manner. The federal government must ensure that the Moore electorate is serviced as a matter of priority. This represents one of the key local priorities that I am pursuing to transform economic development, employment and lifestyles in our area. Operational responsibility for the rollout rests with the contractor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        Co. NBN Co is building and operating the network on a commercial basis at arm's length from the government, in line with the statement of expectations. Decisions regarding the timing of the rollout to specific locations are operational matters for NBN Co so it is able to meet its target of connecting all Australian homes and businesses to high-speed broadband by 2020. The coalition's approach to NBN will see the nationwide rollout completed six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under Labor. The government is prioritising the completion of the network across the nation by 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I was first elected, in September 2013, there were a grand total of just four premises in my electorate with NBN services available. Since then, whilst progress has been slower than we would have liked, as of 3 March 2017 there are now 5,637 homes and business premises with NBN services available. To date, approximately 1,846 premises have signed up for an active connection to the NBN. In order to emphasise the urgency of the implementation, I have organised multiple meetings and received briefings from representatives of NBN Co, which is the contractor responsible for the operational aspects of the rollout. I have also made representations to the Minister for Communications advocating for the more timely delivery of NBN services so that all of my constituents will soon be able to access NBN services. I am pleased to announce that construction of the NBN network in a number of affected suburbs, including Edgewater, will commence around the second half of this year. Overall, switch-on dates for the majority of the electorate are scheduled to occur by mid- to late 2018. When complete, it is estimated that approximately 54,700 homes and business premises in Moore will have NBN access.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investment by government in opening up the information superhighway will connect the community at a number of levels. For instance, it will provide global access to the vast knowledge base contained in the Joondalup Learning Precinct, which includes
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cowan_University" rel="nofollow">
         Edith Cowan University
        </a>
        , the West Coast Institute of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and the police academy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, the Joondalup Health Campus will also be able to utilise the high bandwidth to facilitate telemedicine, specialist medical imaging and robotic medical procedures and to promote interactive experiential learning in conjunction with remote universities. The communications network will extend further to link local industry and commerce in the Joondalup CBD and the Winton Road business park with global markets and supply chains via ebusiness and ecommerce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nationwide, in terms of the digital transformation agenda, as of February this year more than 1.9 million homes and businesses have an active connection to the National Broadband Network, with more than four million premises across our nation able to connect to a service. In fact, according to research by Deloitte Access Economics, it is estimated that the value of Australia's digital economy generated $79 billion in the past financial year, representing 5.1 per cent of national gross domestic product.
       </p>
       <p>
        The future of our local economy depends on investment in innovative new businesses assisting in the transition from mining to services, exports and information technology. As our local economy transitions from the mining construction phase, there is a need to diversify and promote employment growth in other sectors such as information and communications technology. A number of leading software development companies are located in Joondalup, including SEQTA which specialises in award-winning educational software. The NBN is essential to facilitate the development of companies operating in this sector.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        to launch a digital city strategy, which advocates for an expansion in technological infrastructure, platforms and content. It aims to create an educational city and attract new businesses in innovative sectors. The new digital economy will be the driver of innovation and growth for knowledge based activity, incorporating new ways and opportunities to access knowledge, information and services, and creating opportunities through teleconferencing, telecommuting, computer aided design and manufacturing and exciting new business models.
       </p>
       <p>
        The digital strategy is heavily dependent on NBN communications and broadband infrastructure to support the growth of knowledge sector jobs, digital technologies, teleworking and emerging co-working hubs. Located in the Joondalup Learning Precinct, the sixty27 co-working space, which derives its name from Joondalup's 6027 postcode, provides collaborative opportunities between local entrepreneurs, businesses and researchers to drive local innovation. The precinct encompasses the latest in technological development, including cybersecurity, health research, engineering, digital technologies, three-dimensional animation, augmented reality and 3D printing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Joondalup knowledge based precinct provides the opportunity to enhance productivity and international competitiveness through targeted research and collaboration with industry leading to the commercialisation of Australian inventions and innovation. This visionary, strong focus on innovation is designed to enhance business competitiveness and growth and directly complements the aims and objectives of the federal government's Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. The government is committed to investing in Australia's critical research infrastructure, with reforms to research funding to promote a more collaborative approach between researchers and businesses and to achieve commercialisation of intellectual property.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government must ensure that the Moore electorate is serviced as a matter of priority. Investment by government in telecommunications infrastructure through the National Broadband Network rollout over the next two years will help build the digital economy by opening up the information superhighway, connecting people with access to information, services and networks on a global scale. The timely implementation of the National Broadband Network is critical. This represents one of the key local priorities that will transform both economic development and lifestyles in our area.
