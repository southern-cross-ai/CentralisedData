       <p>
        My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure. I refer to the government's own budget papers which show that federal infrastructure investment in Tasmania will fall from $174 million this financial year to $53 million in 2019-20. Is this a reflection of the fact that not a single new federally-funded major infrastructure project has been commenced under either the Abbott or the Turnbull-Joyce governments?

         I thank the honourable member, the member for Grayndler, for his question. It is always a great honour to get a question from the member for Grayndler. He is no doubt very good at his job. He's across his brief. I think he has great prospects in the near future within the Labor Party! I welcome that I get many questions from him. I think it's very proper that the Australian people see how the member for Grayndler performs.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it's interesting: he says there was no federal investment in capital infrastructure. I was down there only recently, seeing the dams and the water infrastructure that we are building. And I look forward to Premier Hodgman building further water infrastructure in Tasmania, and that's most definitely capital infrastructure, and it's most definitely in Tasmania.

           are looking forward to further growth in that. We are very aware of the capital requirements of Tasmania—the capital requirements of the

           and of the water infrastructure projects—because we are a government that builds infrastructure. We are a government that builds substantial infrastructure. And we're currently at work on

           and on Inland Rail. These things are vitally important. We have a vision. We'll make sure that we have a sealed road that goes from the top of

           to the bottom of the mainland and then through, bisecting, Tasmania. This is the sort of vision you have. We are not the philosophers on a log. We are the people who believe in infrastructure. I look forward to many questions from the future leader of the Labor Party.
