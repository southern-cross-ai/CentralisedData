        I'm proud to formally recognise today Mr Kevin Lynch, of Soldiers Point, who received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for sporting services to the community of Newcastle. Mr Lynch is proudly a life member of five sporting organisations as well as being a long-term member of Lions, a volunteer with Meals on Wheels, a parishioner at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Church
        </a>
        for 16 years, and on the board of the local bowling club. Mr Lynch was also a driving force behind the Knights. When we had a tough time staying in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        during the ugly super league war, it took a heavy personal toll. He helped start the petition that ultimately ensured that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Knights" rel="nofollow">

        . Good on you, Kevin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before his retirement to my community of Paterson, Kevin worked for 26 years as a driving instructor, running his own successful business. He proudly says he taught more than 3,000 learners to drive. Anyone who has taught one learner to drive can tell you what a nerve-racking experience that can be. Good on you, Kevin. I think you deserve the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for that and maybe even a knighthood, mate!
       </p>
       <p>
        The most heartwarming thing about Mr Lynch is that he has dedicated this award to his wife, and soulmate, Monica. He said she has always been his strongest supporter. I'm so privileged to represent people like Kevin and Monica. Good on you, Kevin, and well done.
