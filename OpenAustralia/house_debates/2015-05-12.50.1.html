        My question is to the Prime Minister. At the last election, the Prime Minister described a budget deficit of $24 billion as 'a debt and deficit disaster' and 'a budget emergency'. What does the Prime Minister now call a budget deficit of more than $24 billion?

          Debt and deficit is Labor's legacy. They created it and we are fixing it. I can assure the shadow Treasurer that, while this is a budget for jobs, growth and opportunity, while this is a budget that will be responsible, measured and fair, at the heart of this budget is a credible path back to surplus.
         </p>
         <p>
          Members opposite will discover that, while they were completely incapable of dealing with the deficit, this coalition government will reduce the deficit every year. As a figure, we will reduce spending as a percentage of

          every year because we understand economic management and economic responsibility in a way our predecessors simply do not.

          It is good to see the member for Lilley still in this chamber, isn't it? And he wants to be here for a long time to come, to the dismay of the Leader of the Opposition. I hope he will be here for a long time to come because as long as he is here we will remember his infamous beginning to the 2012 budget—'the four years of surpluses that I announce tonight'. That is what he said. Instead, they delivered debt and deficit as far as the eye can see.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the beginning of the 2013 election campaign, members opposite told us that the deficit was going to be $18 billion. It came in at $48 billion—a $30 billion black hole that they should have known about and should have told us about. That is the legacy that we are dealing with.
         </p>
         <p>
          But as the Australian people will see tonight, they can trust their fiscal future with this government. We are on, at last, a credible path back to surplus. We are back on a credible path to economic responsibility. We are a government that are serious about economic responsibility, and we will be again a country that can live within its means.
