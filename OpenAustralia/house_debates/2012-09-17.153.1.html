       <p>
        It is with a sense of history that I stand here tonight to acknowledge the contribution of one local resident in particular, but in the context of the commitment that he and others have made to the community in Springvale over the last half a century. The person I speak of is a man by the name of John Beus. John Beus would not be known to people in this place, but he would be known to the many families he touched in the local area in Springvale over more than half a century.
       </p>
       <p>
        John came from Europe in the aftermath of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and saw all of the horror and tragedy of that war, but he came to a new land. He came to Springvale, and there he made a home for his family. But he made more than that. He made a commitment to that community—a commitment that he saw through for the rest of his life, a commitment that involved organisations such as the Springvale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Benevolent Society
        </a>
        but was also much more than that.
       </p>
       <p>
        He in fact set up the state's second St Vinnie's shop in Springvale. He helped set up a migrant resource centre. He helped at Forsythe House, a home for young offenders, as well as the Springvale Benevolent Society, as I mentioned, which was so dear to his heart over so much of his life.
       </p>
       <p>
        John was one of a number of local residents in the Springvale area who have 'been there' as the Springvale community has changed—on the basis of migration, on the basis of development. It is a community that is so very different to the community that they were initially part of. But he put his heart and soul into that community. He worked hard with others in the local area to ensure that services were provided for those who had moved there. He was a man who was dedicated to that service over that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the Benevolent Society. I would particularly like to mention a number of people who played, over that time, a very significant role and were, with John, the very basis of that community organisation, which helped so many. John's very great friend Wes Eggleston passed away in 2009, I think it was. Again, he was someone who dedicated himself to helping the local community. I can recall attending
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        s for the Springvale Benevolent Society, and you got a real sense that these people were dedicated to assisting those less fortunate than themselves. Wes had a local furniture store, in which he spent so much of his time assisting those who needed help by providing second-hand furniture; he helped those who needed help with the very basics of life. He was a great man, and he has been acknowledged and honoured through the Wes Eggleston Community Service Award, which has been established as an annual award to recognise individuals in the community who, through their selfless actions, have given so much to the care and support of those around them.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that vein, I would also like to acknowledge some other local residents of great significance. Albert and Pat Blashki have been absolute pillars of strength to the local community over so many years. Albert served on the local Springvale Council for many years. In fact, I had the privilege of serving to fill Albert's vacancy when he retired back in the early 1990s for a very short time, before I came to this place. I also acknowledge Brian Pullen, who I saw again just the other day. Unfortunately, it is the case these days that you meet people at funerals. Brian, again, is someone who put a lot of work into the local area over many, many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there are Teresa and Joe Rechichi. Joe is the current president of the Benevolent Society. Again, they have played a major role in really helping local people. Teresa was a former councillor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to be honest with you: most of these people—not quite all of them, but most of them—would not, I think, have ever voted for me in a pink fit. But they are people I am very proud to call friends. They are people whose commitment to their local community is something I am very proud to honour. They are people who can be very proud of the fact that, beyond politics, they have always been prepared to support those in their community who have had greater needs than their own. They are people who have provided the very best example to those around them about what it means to be a good local person. And they are people who have made an organisation like the Springvale Benevolent Society, which started out in the early days supporting two or three people and now supports 40-plus families on a weekly basis in a way that they really need it—
