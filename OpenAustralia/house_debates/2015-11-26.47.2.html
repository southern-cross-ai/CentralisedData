       <p>
        I express our deepest sympathy and condolences for the two victims of the devastating
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n bushfires. There are now also over 13 people in hospital and there are grave concerns held for at least five who are in a critical condition. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Late last night I spoke to both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Weatherill" rel="nofollow">
         Jay Weatherill
        </a>
        , and the opposition leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
         Steven Marshall
        </a>
        , to say that we stand ready to assist in whatever way we can during this tragedy. I know that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Justice Minister
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keenan" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Keenan
        </a>
        , has been in close touch with the South Australian authorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        While conditions have eased, and the emergency warning has been downgraded overnight for Pinery, we know these situations are very unpredictable and we will remain in the closest contact with the authorities in South Australia. People need to stay vigilant and monitor closely the advice from the emergency services, and provided over the ABC.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bushfire season is upon us, as we know. Our Australian summer is challenging, unpredictable and often, as we have seen just in this week, very cruel. I want to pay tribute and record our great admiration and thanks to the firefighters, and their crews, who are tackling the South Australian fires. The nation is in debt to the bravery of our professional firefighters and the volunteers who put their lives at risk again and again to protect their communities. Other states are always helping and they are helping here, with Victoria providing crews and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        aerial support overnight. Defence has also provided a refuelling support at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base at Edinburgh.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said earlier this week, the bushfire season has arrived early this year in many parts of Australia, and it just reinforces the fact that all of us have to be very, very vigilant and take care to protect our lives and property, and those of our neighbours, in the weeks and months ahead.

         The people of fire-affected
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         should know that they are in the thoughts of this parliament and of all Australians. We offer our deep condolences to the loved ones of the lost and the injured.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the last 30 minutes, I have spoken to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Champion" rel="nofollow">
          Nick Champion
         </a>
         , the member for Wakefield, who has returned to be with his family and to be with his constituents in fire-affected South Australia. He tells me that right now there are still lots of blocked roads and that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS" rel="nofollow">
          CFS
         </a>
         are still putting fires out. He tells me that the fire has lapped right up to the town of Kapunda, where he is, and where he grew up. There are harrowing stories, but the hazard has passed for the time being.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everyone says they have never seen a fire like this, of such magnitude and ferocity. A volunteer firefighter in Greenock reports that his father, who has lived and farmed in the area for 75 years, has never seen the like of it before: the scale of losses, the damage, the grief, the death, the injuries, the lost of livestock, cars burnt out by the side of the road, with one abandoned in the middle of the highway and others facing the wrong way—destroyed. Shock is the dominant emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
         We commend the hundreds of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         firefighters and CFS volunteers who, in the past 24 hours, have shown incredible bravery in difficult and dangerous circumstances. As a Victorian I am proud that 200 firefighters and 50 trucks are on the way to Adelaide and will start their first shift tomorrow. This is what Australians do. As
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Lindsay_Gordon" rel="nofollow">
          Adam Lindsay Gordon
         </a>
         once said of Australia:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Life is mainly froth and bubble
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Two things stand like stone —
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Kindness in another's trouble.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Courage in your own.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is the second time in four days our parliament has paused to pay respect to the people who have been lost to bushfires and to salute the resilience and resolve of Australians. With summer having not even begun, these fires are a reminder to all—especially those who live in areas at risk of fire—to be prepared for the very worst. We urge all Australians to have your fire plans ready, and please do everything you can to keep yourself and your family safe in the weeks and months ahead.
