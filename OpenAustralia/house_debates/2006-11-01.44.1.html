        My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        has confirmed to Senate estimates this morning that it has cut its renewables research by five per cent in the last year? Is the Prime Minister aware that CSIRO is shutting down altogether its project on splitting water to create hydrogen fuel—a $1 million setback to renewable energy research? Can the Prime Minister confirm that the Commonwealth’s own scientific research body spent zero dollars on wind research and only $4½ million on solar last year?

            I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question, but I would suggest she not mislead the House by saying that

             CSIRO
            </a>
            has reduced its investment in renewable energy technologies. That is just not correct.

             They didn’t.

             </a>
             reviews its research portfolio annually. Research projects sometimes cease; the investment is redirected into another area of similar research. So the million dollars that the member for Jagajaga is referring to, relating to the investigation of water-splitting technology, has been redirected into another renewable energy research project. So it is exactly the same amount of money in another renewable energy research project.
            </p>
            <p>
             This attack on CSIRO is quite out of bounds. CSIRO is our premier scientific organisation. It rates in the top one per cent of scientific organisations around the world in 13 out of 22 areas of scientific research. In fact—the member for Jagajaga refers to the investment in solar thermal technologies—it was announced today that CSIRO has been awarded an additional almost $3 million in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to be applied to solar thermal technologies. CSIRO is leading the world in a range of technologies, not only on variable energy but renewable energies, and has the government’s complete support.

                 Thank you to the member for Deakin for the question. He has very strong credentials in the area of the environment and supports the government’s ongoing role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This government is taking a leading role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, not just here but across our region. In the last week we have seen the government invest some $250 million in groundbreaking projects under the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, and this morning we saw another key plank in our climate change strategy, with the Prime Minister announcing a further $60 million for 42 clean energy projects as part of Australia’s commitment to the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This funding will help develop a suite of practical emission-reducing measures amongst partnership countries—technologies ranging from renewable energy to energy efficiency right through to clean coal.

                 While the rest of the world talks about what should be done, in just nine months six nations representing 50 per cent of the world’s economy, 50 per cent of the world’s people and 50 per cent of the world’s emissions have put in place the practical foundation for the solution to greenhouse gas emissions. Left behind, waiting for a clue, waiting for an idea, is the Labor Party, still clinging to old Kyoto, still wanting to impose unwanted and unfair costs on the economy, still wanting to send our industries—

                       The debate has moved on, but Labor is stuck in the past with a scheme designed in Europe in the last century. This government, the Howard government, continues to support Australia’s world-leading innovation, which can and will deliver real solutions to the greenhouse gas challenge and see them deployed right across the world. This government will continue to back innovative, practical measures on climate change, because taxes and targets do not deliver; technology does.

                        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying on 19 March 2003 at the

                       <p>
                        Prime Minister, using your Kyoto logic, shouldn’t Australia have waited until every other country invaded Iraq before we sent in troops? Prime Minister, why isn’t Australia one of the 165 countries who have ratified Kyoto, who make up the coalition of the willing against dangerous climate change?

If we were to follow the advice and sign Australia up to an arrangement that imposed a carbon price on the valuable resource industries of this country that did not impose the same price on our competitors, we would, in the words of the member for Batman, who cares about the workers of Australia, do enormous damage not only to the resource industries of Australia but to the workers of Australia. If you want progress on climate change, you have got to involve everybody. If you want to destroy one of the most valuable sectors of the Australian economy, hobble the resource industry with a carbon price that is not being borne by our competitors—and that in reality is the policy of the

Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is helping rural and regional communities during this drought? What is the government’s response to claims that signing Kyoto alone is a quick fix to the problems of drought in Australia?

                                           I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I recognise that many parts of his electorate in Queensland are drought declared, and they are part of the many regions in which we have declared exceptional circumstances across Australia. I know that many of his constituents appreciate the assistance that the government is giving to farming families in those areas. In only the last two weeks we have announced 62 areas as being in drought exceptional circumstances, and we have increased the assistance we are giving to farming families in those areas. More than 50 per cent of Australia’s agricultural land is now drought declared under exceptional circumstances, which is quite significant. Of course, we have announced extra counselling and emergency grants to be administered by the

                                           . Obviously, we are talking to communities such as those communities in the member for Maranoa’s electorate about any other measures that may need to be taken, if warranted, to assist people in those areas. We are not giving them false hope but we are trying in practical ways to help them through this very challenging time.

What we do not need to do is provide false hope that there is a quick fix. We need to recognise that this hot and dry drought is not the longest and not without precedence.

                                           We do need to give people hope. They need to know that we as a nation are going to stand beside them and support them. But we cannot give them the false hope of a quick fix—and that is what the Leader of the Opposition has been doing. He has been creating the illusion that signing Kyoto is going to help out with this dry spell and the hot conditions at the moment. People need to understand that ratifying Kyoto will not stop the

Ratifying Kyoto will not stop El Nino, ratifying Kyoto will not change the fact that El Nino has been with us for centuries, and ratifying Kyoto will not prevent future climate change.

                                           The Labor Party has been wont to refer to and quote from the Stern report on climate change coming out of the United Kingdom. But another report has come out of the United Kingdom—a report by an all-party House of Lords committee which included a former Bank of England Governor. Commenting on the compliance mechanisms in the Kyoto protocol, the report said ‘they were very weak and even counter-productive’. They went on to say that the targets that were set were going to make little difference to rates of warming. The Blair government has done nothing to refute those assertions in that report coming out of the House of Lords committee.

                                           The government is responding to and assisting with the drought in Australia in a very practical way. We are providing moral and financial assistance to the farmers of Australia and we are responding to climate change in a very practical way.
