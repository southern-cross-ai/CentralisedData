        Each year, I rise in this parliament to honour the lives of women who have died in the past year through acts of violence by someone known to them. Tonight, I stand to remember and pay my respects to the 49 women who died last year at the hands of someone they knew. This equates to almost one violent death every week in 2017. Regretfully, the actual number is likely to be much higher, as the list is limited to deaths that have been publicly reported. Before I acknowledge each woman who is no longer with us, I want to acknowledge the researchers from Destroy the Joint who do the heartbreaking and difficult work of maintaining the Counting Dead Women Register, where this information is recorded. Violence against women remains entrenched in Australian society. This register provides a record of this tragic legacy as an enduring reminder of the need for us to redouble our efforts to stop violence against women and children.

        The terrible reality is that one in four women experience intimate partner violence, and one woman every week is killed at the hands of a partner or ex-partner. Each of these deaths is a tragedy, and each death should further galvanise us to do whatever is necessary to end this scourge in our nation. 2018 is little more than a month old, but already eight women have lost their lives as a result of domestic and family violence. We simply must turn this around. I can think of no more pressing priority for this nation and this parliament. I don't want to stand here every year reciting the names of women who have been killed as a result of family and domestic violence, but I will because each and every one of them must be honoured and their deaths cannot be in vain. We have to stop violence against women and children, and we need to do it now.
