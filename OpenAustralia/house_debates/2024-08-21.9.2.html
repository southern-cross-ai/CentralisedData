        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report
        <i>
         Report 219: Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union;
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" rel="nofollow">
          CITES
         </a>
         ; Scientific

         balloons
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I'm pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties's report
        <i>
         Report 219: Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union; CITES; Scientific balloons
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to JSCOT report 219, contained in this report is the Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union, which is a legally binding partnership between Australia and our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Island
        </a>
        partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty enhances development, creates human mobility pathways, including a recommitment to the concept of mobility with dignity, and facilitates cooperation between the two nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty focuses on matters relating to climate change and regional security.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of Tuvaluans.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty elevates Australia's existing relationship with Tuvalu.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty also improves Australia's standing in the Pacific.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also included in the report are amendments to appendices I,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and III of the Convention on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         International Trade
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species" rel="nofollow">
         Endangered Species
        </a>
        of Wild Fauna and Flora.
       </p>
       <p>
        CITES is a prominent multilateral environmental agreement that regulates the international trade in wild fauna and flora via the listing of more than 40,000 species of animals and plants in three appendices.
       </p>
       <p>
        This listing is undertaken based on scientific assessment and analysis of international trade data.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty action amends the species listed in the CITES appendices I,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II_and_III" rel="nofollow">
         II and III
        </a>
        . While most of the listing amendments have no implications for Australia, the listing of the pygmy blue-tongue lizard, four marine species and seven plant species does have some trade implications for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee welcomed the efforts of DCCEEW to keep it aware of the CITES treaty action; however, it notes that almost all the species listings in appendix II came into effect prior to the referral to the committee for consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        This prevented the committee from understanding the concerns of businesses impacted by the listings prior to the date of entry into force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in the report is the Exchange of Notes to extend the Exchange of Notes constituting an agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Amend and Extend the Agreement concerning the Conduct of Scientific Balloon Flights for Civil Research Purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This treaty is as oldschool as they get.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty extends the mutually beneficial agreement between Australia and the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cooperation on space related activities between the two nations dates back to 1957.
       </p>
       <p>
        The extension of the existing agreement allows the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        to continue to use existing facilities in Woomera for the launching, tracking, recording and recovery of scientific balloons in Australian territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the public hearing for the inquiry, the committee heard issues raised in relation to Australian sovereignty as well as a future broadening of the agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee found that the agreement did not impose upon Australian sovereignty. There are no current plans to broaden the scope of the treaty; however, this is possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee supports all three major treaties considered in the report and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take a moment on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to thank the former Chair of JSCOT, Hon. Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Josh Wilson
        </a>
        . His efforts contributed to ensuring that JSCOT was able to conduct inquiries into and report on a large number of treaty actions that are relevant to Australia's national interests. I am told it is the most active tabling committee that we have in our parliament. On behalf of JSCOT, I wish him well in his new role.
