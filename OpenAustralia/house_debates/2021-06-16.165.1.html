        Gary Edwin was awarded for his service to golf. Gary has been teaching golf since 1961 and is recognised as one of Australia's most influential golf coaches. Robyn Porter was celebrated for her service to science and the community, Dr David Rowlands for his service to medicine in general practice and Kobe Steele for her service to conservation and the environment. Kobe is the founder and president of the Orangutan Foundation International Australia. Following a visit to Borneo in 2008, Kobe decided to start up her own not-for-profit Borneo orangutan ecotours so that she could help fund the

        I'll move on to Alan Thomas, who was awarded for his service to horseracing. Alan's broadcasting career started on the Gold Coast in 1971. He has called 22

        I'd like to highlight three other Gold Coasters, well known to me, who have contributed to the Moncrieff electorate through their good work in our community. Cornelia Babbage

Finally, well done to Sandra Doumany OAM and her husband, Sam, who must be very proud. Sandra is known to me as a great northern Gold Coaster, celebrated for her services to
