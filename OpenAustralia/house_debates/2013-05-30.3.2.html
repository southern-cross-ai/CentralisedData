        Commitment to early childhood
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has a proud record of achievement in early childhood education and care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Core to our values is giving every child an opportunity to succeed and we have consistently demonstrated throughout the last six years our commitment to improving the outcomes for all Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        With more Australian children in education and care than ever before and a compelling body of evidence showing that 90 per cent of a child's brain development happens in these critical years, we want to give our children the best start in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian and international research shows that having educators with higher qualifications is closely associated with improved outcomes for children. More highly qualified staff means a greater understanding of early childhood development so staff are more able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill acknowledges that commitment by securing for these educators the necessary recognition of their professionalism and to reward them accordingly with higher wages.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of this bill is this government's commitment to quality early childhood education, a commitment to early childhood education that is accessible and affordable and a commitment to having a highly qualified early childhood workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Quality
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's commitment to quality early childhood education is evidenced by our leadership in establishing the National Quality Framework for early childhood education and care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Quality Framework is an important reform which delivers a higher standard of care for children in the critical areas of educational development, health and safety and social interactions. It provides clear and comprehensive information for families so they can make informed choices about which service is best for their child.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Quality Standard improves quality through improved educator-to-child ratios, stronger educator qualification requirements and a new quality rating system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Quality early childhood education and care ensures that children are happy, engaged and learning with qualified educators who are nurturing and caring. It means children are in safe and stimulating learning environments. When parents drop off their children, they need to do so with confidence that their child will be cared for and educated in the best way possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have recently seen the first ratings published on the website giving parents more information to help them choose the service that meets their needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NQF" rel="nofollow">
         NQF
        </a>
        is a fundamental and long-lasting reform. Ensuring improved quality of early childhood education and care will produce long term improved productivity and economic prosperity for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Early Years Quality Fund will support the implementation of the NQF by assisting providers to offer educators higher wages consistent with changes in staff to child ratios and the increased qualification requirements of the NQF.
       </p>
       <p>
        Affordability and Accessibility
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has been working hard to ensure that quality early childhood education and care remains affordable and accessible for all Australian families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the next four years the government will invest a record $25 billion in early childhood education and care, of which $22.1 billion will be in direct childcare assistance to parents, more than triple the investment in the four years prior to 2007, making improvements to the lives of children and families.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we know that affordability is only part of the story and that accessibility to quality services is critical.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have recognised that early childhood education and care is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour.
       </p>
       <p>
        We understand that services must be more responsive to the varying needs of families. That's why childcare rebate and childcare benefit can be used for a range of flexible approved childcare providers and services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government is trialling new ways to make child care more flexible for families, such as extending opening hours in long day care centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our commitment to accessible quality early childhood education and care is also evidenced by the government's investment of nearly $970 million between 2008 and 2013 to provide all children in the year before school access to a quality preschool education delivered by a quality, qualified early childhood teacher.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent data shows that because of this investment 266,000 four- and five-year-old children were enrolled in a program in the year before full-time school in 2012. This is 60,000 more children enrolled in 2012 than in 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this year's budget, the government announced a further $660 million to extend the universal access commitment to quality early childhood education in the year before school to the end of 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        This brings the total funding to over $1.6 billion to area that was neglected prior to 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is with pride that I can also say that the early childhood education and care Closing the Gap target will be met this year. In 2008 we pledged to deliver access to early childhood education to all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities within five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, 2013, we will meet that target. I am proud to be a part of a government that not only set ambitious long-term goals but provided the funding and leadership to reach that goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Quality Workforce
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day thousands of committed and dedicated early childhood professionals help to prepare Australian children for the world around them, providing a nurturing, caring and supporting environmentâ€”an environment where every child gets the opportunity to learn, grow and develop at their own pace, with people interested only in helping them be the best they can be.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know these critical early years mean so much to a child's future learning and we owe it to both the children and families using early childhood education and those that educate and care for them to do all that we can to recognise and reward the important work that they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        With over 615,000 children in long day care in Australia to the September quarter of last year the benefit to the community is enormous.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, in addition to the critical work educating children, educators are crucial in upholding the economic stability of the country through increased workforce participation and greater security of employment, especially for women.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud of this government's record in assisting the early childhood workforce, through programs such as:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Early Years Quality Fund
       </p>
       <p>
        In bringing this bill here today, the government continues this record of achievement in early childhood through securing a professional workforce that will ensure higher quality education and care for Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        To complement the vital work that this government has done to improve accessibility, affordability and quality of early childhood education and care, this bill establishes a $300 million Early Years Quality Fund to support quality outcomes for children by assisting the early childhood services to attract and retain qualified hardworking professionals in the sector and reduce the numbers of educators leaving the sector overall.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fund, which will operate for two years, will enable grants to be paid services to supplement wage increases of all educators and staff assisting in the provision of quality early childhood education and care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fund will ensure higher wages across all classification scales, providing an incentive for educators to further their careers by attaining higher qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will be the difference between some of the best and brightest in the sector staying in their vitally important profession or leaving for higher wages in sectors such as retail or administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Early Years Quality Fund will assist with maintaining the affordability of early childhood education, along with the government's substantial financial assistance to families through childcare benefit and childcare rebate, while ensuring the high quality of education and care for children.
       </p>
       <p>
        All long day care centres approved for childcare benefit can apply for the funding. Eligible services must demonstrate a commitment to improve quality outcomes for children, including workforce plans to attract and retain qualified staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the government knows that this fund is the first step in the increased professional recognition of early childhood education and care workers. That is why the government also announced the establishment of the Pay Equity Unit in the Fair Work Commission
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pay Equity Unit will undertake research and data collection to inform matters related to pay equity under the Fair Work Act, modern award reviews and annual minimum wage decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Early Years Quality Fund and the Pay Equity Unit build on the record of achievement in the social and community services and aged-care sectors. The government has achieved significant outcomes with respect to pay equity, but is committed to do more to close the gender gap and assist workers in low-paid sectors, who are usually women, to improve wages and gain the professional recognition they deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Early Years Quality Fund will give a much needed wage increase to our professional, hardworking qualified early childhood educators, ensuring that they not only feel valued but that their value to the Australian community is reflected in their pay cheques.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fund continues the government's commitment to economic growth and jobs, supporting parents to remain in the workforce, increasing skills across the workforce and building a productive future for our children. I commend this bill to the House.
       </p>
