        . Each of the wonderful people who received an award this year has made an enduring contribution to our community as a volunteer, seeking neither financial reward nor recognition. Suzanne Bosanquet, from the Gabba Business Association, has been a leader in that group and has also been involved with a number of grassroots organisations and impressive projects in the Woolloongabba community. Kerry Schilling, founder of Kerry's Wildlife Rescue &amp; Care centre, rescues and cares for animals and provides advice to others regarding injured wildlife. The dedicated founding members of the South Brisbane Men's Shed have realised their vision for a men's shed that supports fathers and male relatives of kids with autism. Darren Godwell has done extensive, varied and transformational work with

        Barbara Clarke is a guide for people with disabilities wanting to get involved in walking or running through the Achilles Brisbane group, and, as president of the group, she has led by example, overcoming her own challenges. Mark Delbridge has been essential to saving the much-loved Coorparoo Bowls Club, which came perilously close to closing—Mark has volunteered at least thirty hours a week, doing everything from tending the bar to negotiating contracts. Nera Komaric, a refugee from the former Yugoslavia, founded World Wellness Group in my electorate and has dedicated her life to making sure culturally and linguistically diverse communities can have access to essential services.

        from Carina Juniors Rugby League Football Club have both worked tirelessly raising funds, organising events and running the club. Jill Lane has been with the Belmont Ladies Bowls Club for almost 20 years and is now its honorary treasurer—despite being a volunteer, she's done everything from modernising their accounts system to preparing their financial reports, handling their cash flow and implementing the Single Touch Payroll system, which I'm sure some small businesses can tell you is not easy.

        I want to especially mention 92-year-old Mary Lehn, who's only just stopped running the Carina Senior Citizens Club catering department—a role she had for 15 years. She was running the catering; she did everything from buying the food, organising the people to do the serving, even doing the washing up in that catering role. She also visits residents in the Salvin Park aged-care facility and has helped with hospitality at her local church.
