        Since my election, I've been meeting with as many constituents and community groups as possible to ensure that I am across all the issues in my electorate. Through this process, I have met with some exceptional people and some exceptional groups doing some amazing work. Recently, I met with a group of passionate members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoca_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Avoca Beach
        </a>
        community to discuss their vision to establish a community garden in the beachside suburb. Representatives of this group, who speak on behalf of over 300 members, told me about all the amazing benefits the community gardens can provide, including for your physical and mental health and for your social wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've seen, through the COVID-19 pandemic, how important community spaces like parklands and recreation areas are to maintaining residents' mental health and wellbeing. Community gardens can also make more coherent and cohesive communities by coming together to work collectively and collaboratively on a shared objective like a garden. This vision is one that I certainly do encourage and will support to make it a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thanks and appreciation go to Lisa, Beth, Bruce and Sandra for sharing this vision with me and showing me the beautiful proposed site at Avoca Beach. I very much look forward to working closely with you over the coming weeks and months. Keep up the excellent work.

        Another story from my electorate that I wish to share is about the Wiseberry Peninsula winter appeal 2022. The Wiseberry Peninsula winter appeal 2022 has been a huge success. The Robertson community, especially the Peninsula, were very supportive of this year's campaign for winter donations. Each year the Wiseberry winter appeal collects much-needed winter essentials to donate to fellow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        residents who might be experiencing homelessness or going through a difficult period. This year they supported Coast Shelter, a homelessness and outreach organisation based in Gosford that does some amazing work for people who are vulnerable and homeless.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to report that the Wiseberry Peninsula collected a whopping 54 bags of donations full of winter items and essentials. This equated to a massive 265 kilograms of donations that went straight to Coast Shelter to distribute to people on the Central Coast doing it tough over winter.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the bottom of my heart, I thank the community-minded staff at Wiseberry Peninsula. In particular, I thank Tammy Jackett, who contacted my office; director Rod Dillon; and administrative officer Kiara Kelly. You should all be extremely proud of the results that you've been able to achieve this year. To the exceptional Robertson community and all the small businesses that got behind the campaign and donated: thank you. Finally, to Coast Shelter, thank you for continuing to do what you do each day of the year, 24/7. We know how invaluable and appreciated your service is on the Central Coast.
