        Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Sport and Minister for Health and Aged Care. Will the minister explain to the House how a re-established Australian Building and Construction Commission will ensure hardworking Australians receive the health services and infrastructure they deserve. Is the minister aware of any threats to the progress of health infrastructure?

         <p>
          Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the member for Boothby for her question. She certainly understands the importance of the health of her electorate and the health of the nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Members on our side of course know about the government's record spending on Medicare and public hospitals—public hospital infrastructure, $95 billion over five years, more than any previous government has spent. But we need more than record funding to deliver the world-class health system that Australians have come to expect. It also takes infrastructure; it takes hospital infrastructure. We need hospital infrastructure to deliver our record finding. Unfortunately, due to the actions of unions on building sites across this country—described variously in the trade union royal commission as 'bullies', 'liars', 'thugs' and 'thieves'—that infrastructure has been delayed.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you see a hospital that does not get opened on time, when you see beds that do not arrive on time, when you see treatments that are not delivered on time, you know that this Labor Party is putting the health of their union mates before the health of the nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Due to the actions of unions on hospital building sites, and I will give you an example.

                         or they will be having their conversation outside the chamber. I will make a couple of points to the Manager of Opposition Business. I have heard him and I do respect the fact that the member for Gorton was obviously passionate on the issue—I could see that from here—as are other members. Nonetheless, I have made it very clear on points of order that, if I am hearing a point of order and I ask someone to resume their seat, they need to resume their seat immediately. No matter how passionate they feel about the issue, they will not remain at the dispatch box and shout into the chamber. It was for that reason and the fact that he had been warned for his conduct twice previously in question time—the combination of those things and not resuming his seat—that I was forced to eject him. If he had resumed his seat, I would have heard from the Manager of Opposition Business. Has the minister concluded?
