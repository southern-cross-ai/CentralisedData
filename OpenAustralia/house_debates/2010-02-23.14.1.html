       <p>
        My question is for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer to today’s revelation that it may take up to five years to complete the safety inspections arising from the minister’s failed Home Insulation Program. I would like to know whether the minister will commit to future buyers of homes whether their houses have been insulated under the scheme. Will they receive warnings as to whether those inspections have been completed and will they receive warnings as to whether their ceiling insulation may prove a risk to their homes and their families?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. My answer to the honourable member is that we will ensure that not only the rollout of ceiling insulation under the renewable energy bonus program but also the audit, compliance and inspection program of roofs takes place in an orderly and a timely way. I make a point through you, Mr Speaker, to members opposite: the risk assessment measures that have been put in place in this program from the start and the risk assessment mechanisms that will be in place for this program as it transitions in the future will ensure that public safety—

               Thank you, Mr Speaker. I say to the honourable member, having noted his comments in the doorstop interviews this morning, that for the opposition to continue to raise the spectre of unnecessary high anxiety about insulation risks is to ignore a number of measures that have already been identified by the government and put in place in relation to both this program and the measures that we contemplate in the future. Prior to this, any householder who had a concern about insulation in their ceiling could call the department and have that matter considered and have an appropriate audit and monitoring take place.

                 <p>
                  In relation to the honourable member’s question, I make the following observations: any householders who have safety concerns in relation to insulation in their ceilings already have access to a hotline. There is also a monitoring and compliance program that is being rolled out to ensure that risk identification takes place as a matter of consequence. In relation to the further delivery of ceiling insulation that the government has identified as necessary, householders who continue to have safety concerns are able to request a risk assessment for their home. If the assessment shows that there are any significant risks, on-site inspection by an accredited inspector can be arranged. Inspections will occur over time, as is appropriate, under the program in order to ensure safe delivery of insulation into ceilings.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Additionally, in relation to the announcements made previously, which the member is well aware of, we have identified a more significantly rigorous regime for installers, to enable them to meet the existing requirements under the register. In consultation with state authorities, work safety authorities and others, there will be the provision of quality assessment and the provision of a specific bond, to ensure that any issues in relation to rectification are addressed. All of these matters have been identified as necessary to establish a strengthened regime for the installation of insulation, and householders can have confidence that they will be rolled out in a proper and appropriate manner.
