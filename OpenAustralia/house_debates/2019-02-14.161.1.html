        I would like to update the parliament on a couple of events that have happened in Bennelong recently. This fortnight, I've been fortunate enough to participate in the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Lunar New Year
        </a>
        festivities in Bennelong. This year will mark the vivid return of the Eastwood Lunar New Year celebrations. For over 10 years, our community has enjoyed the festivities of the Eastwood Lunar New Year celebrations, coming together to share in music, dance and merriment. It's an event that is reflective of and celebrates our strong, diverse and vibrant multicultural community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, Eastwood is often described as a microcosm of multicultural change in Australia, and is home to a thriving Asian community of Chinese, Korean, Indian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lankan
        </a>
        immigrants. Nearly 40 per cent of residents have Chinese ancestry, and over 64 per cent of residents speak a language other than English at home. For me, Eastwood is a true representation of Australian ideals of multiculturalism, and I am proud of this contribution made by all for us to come together.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year's celebrations have been especially exciting as we come together to celebrate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Pig" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Pig
        </a>
        , the 12th and final sign of the Chinese zodiac. Those born in the Year of the Pig are considered to be happy, easygoing, honest and sincere, and, in ancient times, a house was only considered a home if it included a rotund pigâ€”a symbol of great happiness and abundance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was joined by many local people, my local state colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Dominello" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and a small pride of lions to bring to the celebrations. Great thanks go to Hugh Lee
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Dr Anthony Ching for organising the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, Eastwood also saw a visit from a very special guest, as the Prime Minister joined local dignitaries to celebrate the Lunar New Year at one of our many excellent local restaurants. Members of both the Chinese and the Korean communities were represented, and a great time was had by all.
       </p>
       <p>
        This weekend, the local celebrations will culminate in the grand event at Eastwood Oval. There will be a spectacular dragon and lion dance of red and gold, which brings good luck and fortune upon the community members. The dance represents the festivity of all of those celebrating, and it reflects the rich and diverse culture we have in Bennelong. Another special moment will be the appearance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppa_Pig" rel="nofollow">
         Peppa Pig
        </a>
        , which I'm sure will be a big hit with the many families, especially the kids, who will join in the celebrations. After a day full of joy and harmony, the celebrations will end with a fantastic display of fireworks officially welcoming in the new year. I hope the Year of the Pig brings our community great happiness, prosperity and good health. Kung hei fat choy!

        At the other side of the electorate, a fight has been underway to save the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Centre
        </a>
        's iconic ice rink. It was with disappointment that I received news of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP" rel="nofollow">
         AMP
        </a>
        's proposed plan to demolish Macquarie's ice rink. The ice rink has been a much loved part of our community for tens of thousands of adults and children who have skated there for nearly 40 years. It has been a playground for those who love to skate and has facilitated all levels of skating from recreational up to Olympic competitors such as gold medallist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Bradbury" rel="nofollow">
         Steven Bradbury
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_MacDonald" rel="nofollow">
         Monica MacDonald
        </a>
        , a seven-time Australian national champion in figure skating, who has joined the effort to stop the redevelopment plan. It would be very sad to see the ice rink lost to the Macquarie Centre redevelopment. Not only would this deprive our community of a great asset but it would also be responsible for dozens of job losses affecting our locals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to see the way the community has rallied together to save this landmark. There has been an overwhelmingly strong response from tens of thousands of local residents who have signed petitions to save this iconic destination. In addition I was glad to hear that, thanks to the efforts of the Hon. Victor Dominello, state MP for Ryde, AMP has agreed to pause their application and allow further community consultation. I'm hopeful that this consultation will result in a positive outcome and help the people of Bennelong protect this great staple of our community. I congratulate Victor and all of the community, who have rallied together to save our ice rink.
