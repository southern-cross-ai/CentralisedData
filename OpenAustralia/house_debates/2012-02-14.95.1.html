        Last week I had the privilege of heading out to Boonah in my electorate of Wright to address some year 12 students as part of a senior leadership forum. I always enjoy taking the opportunity to speak with the kids, especially at this time of the year. It is an odd time in a child's life. They have not quite hit adulthood and are struggling with the decisions that are before them. '

       </p>
       <p>
        Luckily for the kids, it was not just a politician spruiking leadership stories to them. Also in attendance was a former Boonah High student, Kelli Rabbit from

        . There was also Paige Bennett, a former student and house captain now studying nursing in Brisbane. Paige is a charming, confident young woman and it was great to have her back at the school to share some of the aspirational stories that she has from her first year at uni. After Friday's seminar, the seniors departed for Tallebudgera for a weekend leadership camp where they are able to set their vision and work through some team-bonding exercises to cement them as a cohesive group for the rest of the year.

        Before I finish, I would like to offer my congratulations to Boonah State High School principal, Bronwyn Johnstone. Bronwyn is a fantastic asset to that school and the spirit and pride evident in the kids is a credit to her and her staff. I would like to congratulate the 2012 school captains, Laura Pennell, Tahlia Kinrade,

        and Ewan Trehearn. You all have big jobs ahead of you this year in the senior class. Sit back and enjoy it.

        I took the opportunity while I was the kids to ask how many of them were on Facebook. All their hands went up in the air. I said to them, 'Facebook is great from an employer's perspective, because when you give me this glowing resume and tell me how wonderful you are I can check up on you.' I shared with them an example of a guy who applied for a position with me in my transport business. His resume was fantastic. I went on to Facebook and there he was butt nude in a shopping trolley in the lounge room with an empty carton of beer on his head. I said, 'Be mindful, kids, of what you put on Facebook because it gives potential employers and the world an insight into who you really are.' As a boarding school student, I never got the opportunity to go to leadership camps. It is a great way of helping kids in high school transition to being young adults. I hope that they all enjoy the journey that is ahead of them.
