        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill reiterates the government's efforts to boost productivity by reducing the cost of regulation on Australian industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015 will amend the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to remove Australian regulated ships that are used solely for interstate voyages from the existing regulatory regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        The act establishes a regulatory framework to safeguard against unlawful interference with Australian ports, maritime transport and offshore facilities. It gives effect to Australia's international obligations under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ship_and_Port_Facility_Security_Code" rel="nofollow">
         International Ship and Port Facility Security Code
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently under the a ct, all Australian flagged ships of 500 gross ton ne s or more , or that carry 13 or more passengers on international and interstate voyages are security regulated. They must have a Ship Security Plan which includes a security assessment of their operations that provides information on the security measures that the ship has put in place to prevent unlawful interference and the action they would take if an incident occurs.
       </p>
       <p>
        At present, Australian flagged ships that travel on domestic interstate voyages incur costs due to security regulations that are not incurred by (unregulated) Australian flagged ships that only undertake intrastate voyages. This is despite there being arguably no increase in security risk as a result of crossing a domestic state border.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has no obligation to security regulate interstate shipping and there is limited benefit in continuing to do so. The security risks will not change if the existing regulatory regime is removed. The proposed deregulation action will remove the disparity between intrastate and interstate shipping and provide an estimated saving to industry of $938,000 per year.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is in the public interest to continue the security regulation of passenger and vehicle ferries used for interstate voyages due to the nature of their operations in transporting large numbers of passengers and vehicles. Therefore, it is proposed to develop appropriate amendments to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Regulations 2003 to continue the security regulation of such ships.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is committed to ensuring the safety of the travelling public and advancing our maritime trade interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ensuring Australia's maritime transport sector is secure and efficient is central to those outcomes. As such, the maritime transport security regulatory framework is regularly reviewed to ensure it is responsive to changes in the maritime security environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill has no impact on the security obligations of foreign flagged ships under the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
