        . Would the minister inform the House of progress with the establishment of the Australian technical colleges? How will they help young people get a start in the traditional trades?

          I thank the member for Deakin. The member for Hunter said, ‘Don’t forget Singleton,’ because he wants to see more at the Australian technical college in the Hunter. We already have record numbers of people starting in the Hunter for next year. The member for Hunter’s intervention is interesting because in Newcastle and in Maitland enrolments are brimming—it is almost oversubscribed. We are going to do some work in Singleton to make sure that people in that area get the opportunity.
         </p>
         <p>
          To the member for Deakin: at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwood_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
           Ringwood Secondary College
          </a>
          we are going to see at least 180 students next year starting at the Australian technical college that we established there. Indeed, in Deakin we have already seen a 149 per cent increase in the number of apprenticeships—from 1,090 in 1996 to 2,710 people right now training in apprenticeships.
         </p>
         <p>
          This government has spent more money than any other government in Australia’s history on dealing with matters relating to skills and vocational trades. The Australian technical colleges are a key initiative in dealing with skills needs for Australian industry. It will create a new tradition, where the sense of reward for effort for years 11 and 12 students will be re-established. Five colleges are already open and $343.6 million will be spent over the program time. In the operational year of 2007 there will be at least 20 colleges operating, with over 2,000 students at those 20 colleges.
         </p>
         <p>
          By every measure, the Australian technical colleges program is not just on track; it is in fact ahead of the program time allowed for it because the remaining colleges will open in 2008—well within the program guidelines. Nineteen funding agreements have already been signed. We are currently negotiating funding agreements with the other four regions.
         </p>
         <p>
          This government has spent more money when it comes to vocational and technical education than any other Australian government in this nation’s history. All we need is for the state governments to actually realise that it is a partnership between the Commonwealth and the states that will make a difference. Even before the Skills for the Future announcement by the Prime Minister last week, we had such things as the $43.7 million to support Australian apprentices in the form of a living away from home allowance—never under Labor, but only under this government; the Commonwealth trade learning scholarship—never under Labor, but under this government; and the $28.2 million for the Tools for your Trade initiative for Australian apprentices—never under Labor, but under this government. We had 403,600 Australian apprentices in training up to the March quarter 2006. That is a 161 per cent increase since the coalition was elected in 1996. Apprenticeship completions are up 361 per cent—

            Yes, traditional trades are 28 per cent of all Australian apprenticeships. In fact, we have come a long way. The member for Batman gives me an opportunity to make the point—
