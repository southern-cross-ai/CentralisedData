       <p>
        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled
        <i>
         Report 184: nuclear cooperation UK
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”Today I rise to make a statement concerning the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties'
        <i>
         Report 184
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The report deals with the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Kingdom of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" rel="nofollow">
         Great Britain
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Ireland
        </a>
        on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Energy" rel="nofollow">
         Nuclear Energy
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has an export policy for Australian nuclear materials that permits Australian nuclear materials to be used only for peaceful purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's policy also requires the safe and secure storage of Australian nuclear materials, and imposes an accounting framework to ensure that Australian nuclear materials are always subject to Australian standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
         The United Kingdom
        </a>
        will leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. Subject to final agreement between the UK and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        , a transition period during which the UK will be subject to EU laws may apply up until 31 December 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the UK leaves the EU, it will also leave Euratom, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Atomic_Energy_Community" rel="nofollow">
         European Atomic Energy Community
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian nuclear materials in the UK have until now been covered by the Australia-Euratom nuclear cooperation agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the UK leaves Euratom, that agreement will cease to apply to Australian nuclear materials in the UK.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consequently, a new nuclear cooperation agreement with the UK is necessary to enable the uninterrupted transfer of Australian uranium to the UK and to maintain smooth commercial operations for Australian mining companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed agreement will ensure that Australian nuclear safety standards continue to apply to Australian nuclear materials in the UK post-Brexit.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK" rel="nofollow">
         The UK
        </a>
        and Australia have an extensive history of nuclear cooperation, and the UK has a reputation for supporting nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The UK also has an established and expanding civilian nuclear industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The UK holds a third of Australia's nuclear materials in the EU, and is a significant international manufacturer of nuclear fuels.
       </p>
       <p>
        This means that Australian nuclear materials exported to the UK are regularly transferred to third parties following processing into nuclear fuel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third-party transfers of Australian nuclear material from the UK can only be made to countries with which Australia has a nuclear cooperation agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an added precaution, third-party transfers from the UK can only be made with Australia's prior consent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This means that Australian nuclear materials exported to the UK will always be subject to Australian standards and can be accounted for through their life span.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee believes that the Australia-UK nuclear cooperation agreement is in Australia's interest and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.
