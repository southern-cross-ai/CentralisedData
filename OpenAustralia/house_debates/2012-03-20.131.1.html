        It is rare that one has the privilege of being able to speak on two condolence motions, and I do so in the context of knowing both of the parties about whom these resolutions were proposed. I cannot say that I was as familiar with

         Coptic Orthodox Church
        </a>
        died at 88 years. He led Egypt's Christians for some 40 years. I believe tens of thousands of mourners packed into the cathedral in Cairo. He had been unwell, battling liver and lung problems for several years. It is appropriate that we acknowledge his contribution because the Copts trace their faith in Christ to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Mark" rel="nofollow">

        Pope Shenouda was born as Nazir Gayed on 3 August 1923 in Egypt. He graduated in history with a degree from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_University" rel="nofollow">
         Cairo University
        </a>
        . He began attending the Coptic theological classes at night. He entered the priesthood and became a monk, aged 31, in 1954, taking the name of Antonyos El-Suryaani. He spent six years living in solitude in the desert as a hermit in a cave that he carved himself, taking the example of

        , the 117th pope of Alexandria and the patriarch of the see of Saint Mark, in November 1971. He was the first enthroned in the Coptic cathedral of Saint Mark in Cairo. He had been dean of the Coptic Orthodox Theological Seminary. He had a major test as pope in 1976 when the patriarch of Ethiopia was arrested and executed by the Marxist regime. Pope Shenouda refused to acknowledge any replacement in the

        was recognised in 1978 when he received the Browning award of the United States of America as the best preacher of the year. He had been awarded eight honorary degrees. He had specific regard to women and the ministry of women in the Coptic Orthodox Church. Thousands of female servants teach catechism each Sunday, there are women who teach in the Coptic institute and there are many women who serve in the field of social work. He established the order of deaconesses and significantly enhanced the role of women in the Coptic community. Many educated women have consecrated their lives and serve. He had this to say:

       <p class="italic">
        We felt a great need of the work of women and we wanted women to have a certain order and service in the Church, not only to have girls as

        teachers who give a part of their time whenever they can, but we want girls and women to give their whole life to God and serve the church.
       </p>
       <p>
        Internationally he was the first Coptic Orthodox pope to visit the Vatican in over 1,500 years. From August to December 1989 he made an historic 112-day visit to all Coptic churches in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. During his trip he laid the foundation stones of many new churches, consecrated many altars, baptised hundreds of children, consecrated hundreds of deacons and delivered many lectures.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia he consecrated the Church of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Bishoy" rel="nofollow">

        , which was purchased in Bulleen, Melbourne, in 1996. He established the secretariat of pastoral affairs for the church abroad. At the commencement of his papacy there were only seven Coptic churches outside of Egypt, two in each of Canada, the United States of America and Australia, and one in England. At the commencement of his papacy there were 23 dioceses in Egypt. In 2008 there were 50 and there were three dioceses outside of Egypt, then, and now there are 25.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under his leadership the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Church" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        witnessed a growth in Australia and there are currently 28 churches. In 1999 we witnessed the enthronement of the first bishop in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        with His Grace Bishop Suriel. In Australia now there are 42 churches, two theological colleges, five primary and secondary schools, three monasteries, and an elderly persons' hostel. We now have four churches in New Zealand, two in Fiji, and one each in Japan, Thailand and Singapore.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you can see, I have taken a great deal of interest in the role of the Coptic Church here in Australia. Pope Shenouda has given great leadership. I met him first when he visited Australia in 1995 when I was the shadow minister for immigration. I had the privilege of meeting him subsequently in his visits in 1996 and 2002. He was very conscious of the importance of Christians being able to live in the areas which were their homes. While he worked with me in relation to assisting with the plight of many who may be refugees because of conversions that occur from time to time, his role was to keep the Coptic community active and engaged in Egypt, which was their homeland, and where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark" rel="nofollow">
         St Mark
        </a>
        first preached to them. I do very much regret his passing and I wanted to be associated with this condolence, believing that I am possibly the only serving member of the parliament to have met with Pope Shenouda.

         III. Pope Shenouda was by any test a very significant figure in the religious life of the 20th century. He was the leader of his church for just over 40 years. There would be very few leaders of any congregation in any religion who could say that they led their church for 40 years. He led it with distinction and was much loved among the Coptic community.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was not a one-dimensional figure. He studied at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_University" rel="nofollow">
          Cairo University
         </a>
         and completed a Bachelor of Arts in English and History in 1947. After graduating as dux and completing his military service he began to work as a teacher of English, History and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Sciences" rel="nofollow">
          Social Sciences
         </a>
         at a high school in Cairo. One thing I have noticed about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Church" rel="nofollow">
          Coptic Church
         </a>
         is that their clergy are often called to the church after a career in other fields, and they often come with a very strong and clear understanding of some secular fields. His Holiness was no exception to that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have come to know the Coptic community well. I did not have the opportunity to meet with Pope Shenouda, but I have come to know the Coptic community very well in my capacity as Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I have met with them in the electorate of the honourable member for Holt at the very impressive new church being built. I have met with them at various churches in Sydney and met with them, of course, in my office. I have discussed the various challenges of the Coptic community in Egypt as we speak, which I will not go through on this occasion as this is a condolence motion. I raise that to make the point that I have been struck in my interactions with the Coptic community by the love and respect for His Holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was quite clear for some time that His Holiness was not in the best of health. I know that Bishop Suriel visited His Holiness to celebrate the 40th anniversary of him becoming pope just last year. I had discussed that visit with him and how much he was looking forward to seeing His Holiness. In my interactions with the Coptic community the esteem that His Holiness was held in has been made very clear to me. He was held in esteem because of his office but also because of his approach and very clear commitment to religious understanding and interfaith dialogue. I note that many leaders of the Islamic faith, for example in Egypt, have expressed very strong condolences at his loss. He was responsible for the expansion of the Coptic Church. As Copts moved throughout the world, His Holiness oversaw expansion of his church. There were seven
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
          Coptic Orthodox
         </a>
         churches outside of Egypt when he became pope. There are now well over 100 and there are now many in Australia, 42. There is one here in Canberra and several in Sydney and Melbourne and in other cities, so he has overseen a very substantial expansion in the Coptic diaspora.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do want to pay my condolences. His Holiness did visit Australia seven times during his papacy, his last being in 2002. He was deeply loved and respected, and I think we have seen an outpouring of emotion not only in the streets of Cairo and the services at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark" rel="nofollow">
          St Mark
         </a>
         's over the last 48 hours but also in Australia. I do not think His Holiness would have foreseen social media when he became pope, but social media has been very active since the news on Saturday that he had passed with members of the Coptic community expressing their grief at his passing. I am very glad that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition initiated this motion yesterday. It is very appropriate that the parliament pay those respects as a parliament to His Holiness for his leadership and gratitude for his service. I note that there is a funeral service tonight in Cairo, and we will all be watching closely in the hope that it proceeds peacefully. It will be a very substantial gathering of the Coptic people. We all will be holding our breath that it proceeds as it should, with the outpouring of grief on behalf of the community, in peace. His Holiness will be missed. I extend, as I have done personally, my condolences to His Grace Bishop Suriel, the leaders and the entire Coptic community of Australia.

           Coptic Orthodox

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East
          </a>
          . His Holiness was the 117th in the line of leaders tracing back to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark" rel="nofollow">
           St Mark
          </a>
          himself. We extend our deepest condolences to that community and to His Holiness's entire flock from all of our fellow Australians here and to all the faithful over in Egypt and around the world. Tens of thousands of mourners filled
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark's" rel="nofollow">
           St Mark's
          </a>
          Cathedral in Cairo to farewell His Holiness. The line stretched for almost a mile, I am told, with people wishing to pay tribute to a great man and a man of God.
         </p>
         <p>
          When he became Pope in 1971 there were only seven churches outside of Egypt. Three decades on, there are more than 150, including in my electorate, in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire" rel="nofollow">
           Sutherland Shire
          </a>
          , at Kirrawee. It is led by Father Tadros, who, together with Bishop Suriel, has been a tremendous advocate for the people of Coptic faith in Australia and those from Egypt in particular. In
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           Australia and New Zealand
          </a>
          there are now 28 Coptic churches. I had the great privilege, just the Sunday before his passing, to attend and participate in the worship of the congregation at St Mark's
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Church" rel="nofollow">
           Coptic Church
          </a>
          in Arncliffe. This was a wonderful time to be with them and it is so sad that so soon after this same community would have been struck by the grief of the passing of this great man of God. It was a tremendous community at Arncliffe. There were around 1,000 people there between the two services. While the services themselves were very moving, what was even more moving was the tremendous sense of community amongst those of the Coptic faith in Australia. To see small children, old men and women, mothers and father, aunties and uncles and others gathering round a Sunday lunch in the grounds of their church was, by any definition, the true meaning of community. This is the type of faith community that His Holiness has inspired not just in Arncliffe but all around the world and at the many congregations and parishes.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is much to be thankful for but there is also much to grieve over and, today, as we remember his life and legacy, we remember too in this place the Copts of Egypt and what they currently face. To the faithful in Egypt, as they grieve the loss of their beloved leader, we send our condolences and now more than ever they need our thoughts and our prayers, but most importantly they need our voices to continue to plead their case for justice.
         </p>
         <p>
          We had all hoped, as the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others have expressed, that the events of the fall of Mubarak would have led to a new period for the Copts in Egypt and that there would have been a new hope. But, sadly, what they have known is quite different. It is a matter of extraordinary grief and concern to Copts living in Australia as they hear, on a daily basis, stories about their friends and their families.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to thank the minister for his efforts in reaching out to the Coptic community in Australia. We have attended many events and on one occasion last spring we were together in Sydney. We know only too deeply the level of pain, emotionally and spiritually, that they are going through as they think of those who are in that place.

          Egypt has eight million Copts. The Coptic faithful in Australia number about 100,000. So, as we go into this evening and as they go through the process of mourning and grief, my prayers are with them. I know that they will be sustained in this terrible moment by a great faith that is possessed by them individually and as a community, and a great faith that was demonstrated by their beloved leader

           was an incredibly powerful voice for unity, for tolerance and for reconciliation. He was also a much loved leader of

            Coptic Christian
           </a>
           s around the world and a great leader of his church who had a strong commitment to Egypt's national unity. Pope Shenouda III reigned for over 40 years and for many Copts, which make up about 10 per cent of Egypt's population of about 80 million people, and Australia's 80,000-strong Coptic community, he was the only pope that they had ever known.
          </p>
          <p>
           For Bishop Suriel the death was particularly poignant. He had been secretary to Pope Shenouda III for over five years. Bishop Suriel said the pope, 'has left his mark on his church and his people. He got on well with Muslims, was a great ascetic and scholar and wrote more than 120 books and some very beautiful poetry in Arabic.' Bishop Suriel also reminded the Coptic faithful in Australia of the six visits that Pope Shenouda III had made to Australia, and of his love of the country and pride in the work being carried out by the

            Coptic Church
           </a>
           and Coptic schools in Melbourne and Sydney. During Pope Shenouda's reign he remained committed to his country of Egypt and was seen as a protector of Egypt's

            Coptic Christians
           </a>
           during recent attacks on Copts by Islamist militants in recent years. Accordingly to Councillor Sam Aziz, Pope Shenouda was also committed during his reign to spending at least three days a week in the monastery in order to write sermons and to continue to educate the Coptic community about the Christian faith. According to Councillor Aziz, who is a member of the Coptic community in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Pope Shenouda III was an amazing pope. When he became Pope in 1971 there were only a handful of Coptic churches around the world but now there are hundreds. This is Pope Shenouda's main legacy, which saw a huge expansion of the

            Coptic Orthodox

           and Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
           Another important legacy was his commitment to the concept of unity of Christian churches that took him to the Vatican in 1973 to meet
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" rel="nofollow">

            Coptic Pope
           </a>
           for over fifteen-hundred years to go to Rome. He believed that Christian unity was a matter of faith rather than of jurisdiction. As he told a forum in 1974, 'Christian people, being fed up with divisions, are pushing their church leaders to do something about church unity and I am sure that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit" rel="nofollow">
            Holy Spirit
           </a>
           is inspiring us.' Importantly, Councillor Aziz said that Pope Shenouda always had an amazingly happy disposition and, when you fell down, he was always someone you could listen to in order to cheer you up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Councillor Aziz has also told me an amazing story of when Pope Shenouda went to a Melbourne field in Hallam in my electorate of Holt in the early 1990s and explained his vision for a church to spring out from the field with a cattle shed on it. Soon after making this announcement, Councillor Aziz said that Copts throughout Melbourne started to make donations in order to make this vision a reality. Fortunately, prior to Pope Shenouda's passing this year, this vision became a reality with the opening of a beautiful new $6 million
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mina" rel="nofollow">

           and

            St Marina
           </a>
           church, the sixth church in Melbourne, which now sits on the former field and serves 800 Coptic families in the local community. It is a magnificent church, and the minister for immigration has attended that church. It is an adornment to the Coptic community. You can see it from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Princes Highway
           </a>
           at night. It is a sparkling symbol of the hope and faith of a vibrant community that lives in my area. The story about the Hallam field, otherwise known as the 'cattle-shed story' to the Melbourne Copts, is a reminder of Pope Shenouda's greatness and his vision to strengthen the Coptic community's presence around the world even in periods of adversity. This should be remembered.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to Councillor Aziz, Pope Shenouda felt like a father to him. When he had lost his own father six years ago, Pope Shenouda provided him with the inspiration and the fatherly advice through his sermons. Pope Shenouda was, in many ways, a father-figure for so many Copts and now that he has passed away, Councillor Aziz has said that many Copts like himself feel that they are orphans due to the passing of this great father-figure.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pope Shenouda's funeral will take place later tonight, as has been discussed, in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark" rel="nofollow">
            St Mark
           </a>
           's Cathedral in Cairo. A very large crowd of about 100,000 mourners are expected to gather. We pray for them, that they can mourn the passing of this great figure in peace and pay their respects, as is their entitlement.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Coptic church was established in the city of Alexandria around 43AD. I have no doubt that Pope Shenouda's reign will long be remembered for many years to come by Coptic Christians as a time when a modest pope with a positive disposition led an unprecedented expansion in the Coptic faith to all parts of the world, including, thankfully, to my federal electorate of Holt.

            It is not my intention to take much of the chamber's time or to go over a lot of the ground that others have already covered. There is no doubt that it is a tragedy for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Church" rel="nofollow">
             Coptic Church
            </a>
            around the world and particularly for those in Australia and within the electorate of Cowan that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Shenouda" rel="nofollow">

            III has passed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say, as has been said, Pope Shenouda has certainly helped and encouraged the proliferation of churches across the world. The increase from 1971 in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" rel="nofollow">
             North America
            </a>
            of four churches to more than 200 was certainly a massive increase. As I have said before, even in the last few years there has been a church within Cowan, so that has been a great step forward for the Coptic community within the electorate. That church, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark" rel="nofollow">

            and St George

            Church, has provided a great spiritual home for the Coptic people within the northern suburbs of Perth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I come to the balance of what I would like to talk about. Unfortunately, the Coptic Church remains persecuted within the main homeland of Egypt, being the main centre of the church. As we know, 10 per cent of Egyptians are of the Coptic Orthodox Christian faith. Since the Mubarak regime fell and the alleged great step forward of the so-called Arab Spring, 100,000 Copts have left Egypt in fear for their safety. The reality is that the current government of Egypt is not a moderate government. It is strongly influenced by extremists such as the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" rel="nofollow">
             Muslim Brotherhood
            </a>
            and, since the fall of Mubarak, it has not been good for the Coptic Church. The reality is that the Coptic Church has borne the brunt of growing religious intolerance in Egypt, which has no doubt been manifested in sectarian violence. There is also no doubt that there is a connection between the increasing Islamification or extremism in Egypt and the attacks on the Coptic Church. The increasing levels of hostility towards the Copts in Egypt has been matched by an unwillingness of the government to execute the laws to provide the protection that a government is responsible for. The rising number of bombings and attacks on the church and on the followers of the Coptic faith has been terrible and there has been no decline in recent times. So it really is a test and a challenge to the Egyptian governmentâ€”as the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon.

            , saidâ€”to provide freedom of religion and to provide protection of faiths in their country.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have been found wanting so far and I can only hope and pray that there will be an improvement in the future. The loss of

             Pope Shenouda III
            </a>
            has been a great tragedy for the Coptic community but they are a people of great resilience and faith and they will rise together as one with the new pope when the new pope is selected.

             as a man of deep faith, a leader of a great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation. His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together.

             The Coptic community represents 10 to 15 per cent of the 80 million people of Egypt. It is the largest Christian community in the

             â€”some people would say 'left in the Middle East' after what has been unfortunately happening to the Christians of Iraq. The Copts are a link to ancient Egypt. The Coptic language is the last remnant of the language of Pharaonic hieroglyphs. Their culture and traditions predate Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let us remember the internal conflict that has consumed Egypt over the past decade. The attacks on
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Christian" rel="nofollow">
              Coptic Christian
             </a>
             s in Egypt have caused enormous tension between Christians and Muslims in Egypt. Pope Shenouda III could have gone down the path of division. He could have chose the path of retribution and revenge. But, as a man of great faith and peace, he preferred peace and accord. He chose to believe and to encourage the better of his fellow citizens. He believed that he was the keeper of his brothers and sisters. We remember last
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve" rel="nofollow">
              New Year's Eve
             </a>
             in Egypt, when the Coptic community came together at al-Qiddissin or Saints Church in Alexandria, one of the most famous Coptic churches in Egypt, to celebrate the coming of the new year. We remember how that celebrating church community was ripped apart by a terrible explosion, set off by a jihadist suicide bomber, killing 22 men, women and children and injuring 98 people. It is particularly shocking to attack people in the middle of religious services. I think those people who were killed on that occasion, just like the poor
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Christians" rel="nofollow">
              Iraqi Christians
             </a>
             who were blown up at mass along with their priest while they were at prayer, show that these jihadists have no religious beliefs and no faith. In fact, I agree with the many Islamic scholars who say that these people are the antithesis of faith and indeed of Islam. We remember the consequences of this violence in Egypt that stretched beyond the borders of Egypt, even to here in Australia. Four Coptic churches in Australia were listed among 64 worldwide as al-Qaeda targets.

             services in January at the cathedral that had been so savagely attacked by the forces of hatred. His words at the service were indicative of the way that His Holiness lived his life. This is what he said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             For the first time in the history of the cathedral, it is packed with all types of Islamist leaders in Egypt," Shenouda told the gathering. They all agree â€¦ on the stability of this country and on loving it, working for it and working with the Copts as one hand for Egypt's sake
            </p>
            <p>
             He believed that the path ahead was not division and more bloodshed. He believed that the future of the nation should be sown with Egyptians facing internal struggles together. Our Prime Minister said yesterday:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Australian government has reminded the Egyptian government of Egypt's own traditions of religious tolerance and we welcome the Egyptian government's stated commitment to maintaining their history of religious tolerance and inclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
             This parliament has many times, not just in this condolence motion, shown its affirmation of those principles. We, like other Western countries, will be keeping a very keen eye on events in Egypt. So while Egypt negotiates around the precipice of division, which has been opened by these terrible acts of the jihadists, and is faced with the rising elements thereâ€”even while Egypt tries to emerge towards democracyâ€”one can hope and pray that Pope Shenouda III's legacy of peace and accord remains at the forefront of Egypt's national psyche and its future. I particularly pay my condolences to His Grace Bishop Suriel, the Coptic Bishop of Melbourne, and to the various Coptic ministers who I have worked with very strongly over the last year and a half to show the wider Australian community's support for the Copts in Egypt. I particularly also mention my friends Peter and Lydia Khalil and their families, who are members of the Coptic community and who are in need of condolence over the death of Pope Shenouda III at 88, after 40 years of service to the

              </a>
              . Over his four-decade reign, Pope Shenouda faced challenges of ongoing persecutions against the followers of his faith, particularly in the latter half of his time leading the

              of Alexandria, when violence against his people escalated, particularly since the recent Egyptian revolution. Against the backdrop of violence toward his people, the pope had been a bulwark of strength and determination. He provided an inspirational symbol of hope and tolerance at a time when it was most needed.
             </p>
             <p>
              His elevation in 1971 made Pope Shenouda III the 117th Coptic pope in a continuous line since St Mark the Apostle. He was a widely respected figure who dedicated himself to all his people. In a part of the globe routinely marked by division and hostility his leadership stood above others in the region and he is respected for leading a dialogue based on the promotion of harmony and peace across religious divides in a country often ravaged by the same divisions as its neighbours. Indeed, President

             <p class="italic">
              His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pope Shenouda was widely respected on all sides for his strident efforts to maintain peace and to make peace where necessary. His values of harmony through negotiation and cooperation meant his standing was widespread, both among the Egyptian military and the Islamic majority.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here are just a few examples of his leadership in peace. During his reign Pope Shenouda had quarrelled bitterly at times with the previous
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_President" rel="nofollow">
               Egyptian President

              . He complained about growing Islamic radicalisation and how he saw Anwar Sadat's insufficient action on those issues. Sadat took the step of actually deposing the pope and forcing him into internal exile in a remote Coptic monastery, St Bishoy, in the desert between Cairo and Alexandria. On 2 January 1995 the new

               Orthodox Christmas
              </a>
              on 7 January of that year. When he went to the pulpit to give his much awaited sermon after the exile imposed upon him he spoke how the Copts were one part of the Egyptian nation. He was explicit about maintaining good relations with the Muslims. He said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              All Copts open their hearts to their brothers, the Muslims. We feel they are our flesh and our blood in this beloved nation.
             </p>

              s were killed in Alexandria and the Coptic community took to the streets of Cairo protesting, again it was Pope Shenouda who was the symbol of peace and stability. He said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I plead with our sons to calm down. There are many demands, but this is not the way to ask for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the year 2000 he was a well-deserving recipient of the

              Madanjeet Singh Prize for the promotion of tolerance and non-violence. But among his people he was so much more. For the Coptic people Pope Shenouda was a father to all. Many struggle to remember a time when he was not a comforting figure looking out for them in the recent hostile times. Under the reign of Pope Shenouda the Coptic Church has expanded its reach, providing support for the Coptic Diaspora in all corners of the world, including the

              , Canada, France and other European nations, as well as here in Australia. In Australia Pope Shenouda ordained the first Coptic bishops for Australia, His Grace Bishop Suriel of the Diocese of Melbourne and affiliated regions in 1999 and His Grace Bishop Daniel of the

              and affiliated regions in 2002.

              Also during this time three Coptic schools were established in Australia. The electorate of Hughes, which I represent, is blessed to have

              . His Holiness Pope Shenouda last visited our shores in 2002, and he visited St Mark's in my seat of Hughes. Many in my electorates still remember his visit with such fond memories. They recall the care and interest His Holiness showed to each and every one of those who came before him. They recall the wisdom that he spoke and the love he had for everyone, both within and outside of his faith.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has been said that Pope Shenouda was a man of great humour. Monika Mikhail from the Australian Coptic Movement put it eloquently when she described His Holiness as 'a beautiful soul, a man who loved to laugh; there will never be another Pope Shenouda III.' Pope Shenouda was truly a man of peace. No one who came into his presence could claim not to be moved by his words and deeds. But these personal experiences are not unique. Pope Shenouda was a guiding force for his peopleâ€”a respected and wise leader who served as Shepherd, in all senses of the word. He was a protector, he was a carer, he was a senior role model with no equal; he was a great man of the modern age.
             </p>
             <p>
              He delivered the strongest leadership in a time where his people have faced the toughest challenges in their history. His passing has been marked by extreme sorrow among his followers. Tens of thousands of mourners converged on
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">

              in Cairo last Sunday our time, lining up for the opportunity to bid farewell to the man they have revered, as their Pope and spiritual guide, for more than 40 years. The world has lost a man of immense wisdom, character and spirit. As the people who inhabit the globe, we are less for him no longer being with us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Within the hour, the funeral for the Pope will be held at St Bishoy monastery in the

              , where he spent his years in exile under the then reign of President Sadat. When eight o'clock comes around, I along with my friends in the Australian Coptic community will stop to reflect on this great man's life and feel at once both saddened and joyful for what His Holiness achieved and for what he has given the world in his extraordinary life. Thrice blessed His Holiness Pope Shenouda III.

               His Holiness was suspended from the church between 1966 and 1969 for his radical 'campaigns for change', which among other things called for the popular election of bishops and priests. In 1973, His Holiness was the first Coptic Orthodox pope to sit down with the Pope of the

              <p>
               Pope Shenouda was passionate about social justice and equality, especially the need for peace in the

                Middle East
               </a>
               and justice for the Palestinian people. After the cessation for several centuries, Pope Shenouda also reinstated the ordination of deaconesses and brought women into theological colleges and communal church councils. His Holiness devoted himself to bringing the people of Egypt together, no matter what their faith. In 2001, he said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Love generates love, and separation generates separation.
              </p>
              <p>
               His Holiness inspired the growth of churches outside Egypt, from seven in 1971 to more than 150 today. Indeed, the first Coptic church in Australia was established in my electorate of Grayndlerâ€”St Mary and

               in Railway Road, Sydenham. He also empowered Coptic youth around the world and drew them into the church, declaring that 'a Church without youth is a Church without a future'. Indeed, His Holiness was vital in setting up three Coptic Orthodox schools in Sydney. He was a scholar and a philosopher, authoring more than 100 books in his time as Pope of Alexandria on spirituality and theology. I like the words of Father Antonios Kaldas of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel_Michael" rel="nofollow">
                Archangel Michael
               </a>
               and St Bishoy Coptic Orthodox Church in Sydney. Let me quote:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The real Church is not made up of buildings and institutions. Those things are just tools we use to build the real Church, which is made up of the hearts and lives of every member of the Church. Where there is love, where there is truth, where there is wisdom, and nobility, integrity and honour, kindness and compassionâ€”that is the real church. These are not things that you can put numbers to get yet they are the things that really matter. They are the things that Pope Shenouda has a very special way of nurturing and inspiring in others.
              </p>
              <p>
               I certainly had the great honour of meeting Pope Shenouda on his sixth papal visit to Australia in November 2002. Prior to that I had travelled to Egypt. Included on that delegation were two Marrickville councillors, Morris Hanna, now the Mayor of Marrickville, and Morris Tadros, as part of the delegation from my local community to Egypt. There we met many Coptic Orthodox leaders and engaged in a dialogue that was extremely positive.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pope Shenouda was indeed a special man, a man who led from the heart, promoting peace and understanding between Egyptians the world over. I offer my sincere condolences to the Coptic Orthodox community in this time of mourning and sadness.

                Church sadly passed away on Saturday, 17 March at the age of 88. According to the records, he was the 117th patriarch of Alexandria. He ruled for over 41 years, presiding over a worldwide expansion of the

                He was born Nazeer Gayed on 3 August 1923 in Egypt, the youngest of eight children. Commentators say that by the age of 16 he was extremely active in his church, serving as a Sunday school teacher and attending classes at the Coptic theological seminary. By 1954 Gayed became a monk, taking the name Father el-Syriani, Anthony the Syrian, and dedicating his life to meditation and prayer. In 1971 he was elected to the papacy and took the name Shenouda. There are many reports indicating that during his leadership

                </a>
                was well known for his deep commitment to Christian community. Indeed, this was demonstrated in 1973 when he became the first Coptic Orthodox pope of Alexandria to meet the pope of Rome in over 1,500 years. Many news reports over the weekend claimed that he was known to his followers as 'Baba Shenouda' and they admired him for his charismatic leadership and sense of humour, so much so that many Copts apparently paid special tribute to him by hanging his portrait in their homes and businesses. According to many, they saw him as a protector of their community.

                Accompanied by an entourage of 10 bishops, Pope Shenouda first visited Australia in late 1989. His Holiness met with the then Prime Minister,

               <p>
                Since his passing there are a number of media outlets reporting that many describe Pope Shenouda as a national figure and a symbol of Egyptian nationalism, who earned great respect from the Egyptian people. His passing is a great loss to the worldwide Coptic community and in particular those who have lost their patriarch in the Northern Territory. I extend my condolences to the Copts around the world mourning his loss.

                 III, who died on 17 March 2012. I did not personally know Pope Shenouda, but I knew of him. He was a person befitting the tributes that have flowed from around the world in acknowledgement of his passing and, more importantly, in acknowledgement of his life of fostering goodwill, understanding and harmony between people of all nations. From the time that he became the 117th Pope of Alexandria on 14 November 1971, he presided over a worldwide expansion of the Coptic church, with hundreds of new parishes being established in over 70 countries.

                 . Wherever Christianity poses a threat to religious extremism, injustice, discrimination or political tyranny, Christians have been persecuted and killed. Over the centuries, many Christians have died because of their beliefs. It is my view that the greatest world leaders have been men and women who have endured their own struggles in life, because from struggles come wisdom and strength of mind. Great leaders are also men and women of peace.

                 The Coptic church in Egypt has indeed a long history, but Coptic Christians are today a minority group representing about 10 per cent of the population. Coptic Christians continue to be victimised by Islamic extremists, yet Pope Shenouda was a strong believer in coexistence. He promoted understanding between

                 Coptic Christians around the world have lost a great leader. The world has lost a great statesman. His life will be remembered with affection and respect by all who knew him. The many tributes to his life and the tens of thousands of people around the world who today mourn his death are testimony to the esteem in which he was held. To Coptic Christians around the world I extend my respects and my sympathy at the loss of Pope Shenouda III.

                  III and obviously to express my sincere regret at his passing and convey my condolences to the Coptic communityâ€”in particular here in Australia but all over the world. His Holiness passed away on 17 March. He was the patriarch of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. He was the spiritual leader of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
                   Coptic Orthodox
                  </a>
                  Church of Alexandria for four decades and he served in religious life for 60 years. He was much loved as a leader and as the head of his church. He was highly regarded for his work in re-energising the Coptic community across the world, and he was a strong advocate for peace. That strong commitment to peace saw him advocate never giving into sectarianism and he sought peace even in the most difficult of circumstances. He advocated unification in Egypt.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I had the privilege of meeting Pope Shenouda in 1993 on one of his many visits here to Australia. The Coptic church in Oakley was then in my electorate and together we opened the Coptic Village Hostel in Hallam. It was a partnership between the Commonwealth and the Coptic community and it was a recognition of that reaching out and that service delivery and that social dimension that he so strongly advocated. It was a joyous day and he was a wonderful person, a very friendly person, a very warm person, and clearly his flock followed him and loved him.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What struck me also about the Pope was his commitment to leading diaspora communities including Copts in Australia. He travelled widely and he in fact grew that diaspora significantly. I think under his reign from a handful of Coptic churches outside of Egypt, he grew it to over 150 and, as the previous speaker has indicated, in over 70 countries around the world. The Coptic community here in Australia has a rich cultural heritage which they have proudly carried forward.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also recall his commitment to driving reform of the education system, both secular and religious. Under his leadership a number of Coptic educational institutions including schools and theological colleges were opened here in Australia. We have heard here in the chamber today that the Coptic community has lost a great leader and the Prime Minister in her words yesterday said, 'Like his flock, Pope Shenouda was an Egyptian patriot as well as a devout Christian. In his life, his claim for equal treatment of his flock was no more than the assertion of the rights that all Egyptians should experience.'
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Here in Australia the Coptic leader, His Grace Bishop Suriel, said, 'He left his mark on the church and people. He got on well with Muslims, he was a great ascetic and a scholar. He wrote more than 120 books and some very beautiful poetry in Arabic.' His was a difficult life prior to taking up the leadership of church. He was as an ascetic a hermit, then he was imprisoned and then he led the church.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Here in Australia today
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Christian" rel="nofollow">
                   Coptic Christian
                  </a>
                  s look to events in Egypt with anxiety. I think it is incumbent on all of us, in memory of his values and to his legacy, that the Australian community as friends of the Copts work with Egypt for peace. In the way in which he sought it, we too must seek it. We encourage a peaceful mourning process and hope that Pope Shenouda's legacy of peace continues. Again I offer my condolences to the Coptic community in Australia at this very sad time.

The adjoining electorate of Barton had the second largest number with the largest being in that electorate of Chifley. The numbers were very much concentrated in those three electorates. I particularly offer my condolences to the Coptic community in the seat of Banks and especially to Reverend Father Moussa Soliman, the Pastor of St Abraams Church in Peakhurst, and his congregation.

                   In Australia there are 42 churches, two theological colleges, five primary and secondary schools, three monasteries and a hostel for the elderly. They will all be grieving. Religious organisations in migrant communities are very different from those in other communities. My background is that of a Maronite. There is a very, very strong emotional attachment in those communities to their religious leaders. The sorrow and the grieving within the Coptic community would be enormous at this point in time. Just as people look to their politicians to provide worldly support, it is their religious leaders they look to for spiritual support. In terms of a lot of the suffering that people have on this earth, they are strengthened by the spiritual reward in heaven as they know it.

                  <p>
                   The bond that I have witnessed in the Coptic community is very strong. At times such as the uprising in Egypt, where the Copts see themselvesâ€”and they areâ€”being singled out unfairly because the practice of their religion, religious leaders play a very important role in their attempts to soothe and console the communities. That is why the death of His Holiness would be felt very heavily within the Coptic community. We need, in some respects, to walk in their shoes because the burden in their shoes is much greater than the burden that we sometimes feel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I want to associate myself with the remarks of all who have spoken on this condolence motion, on both sides of the House. This is a time when we all come together, when there are no politics being played, particularly in recognition of the religious contribution to the stability of these communities and the healing that occasionally needs to happen. All sides recognise that; all sides have experienced it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   To be honest with you, those of us with a bit of migrant blood in us, a migrant background, have a level of empathyâ€”no disrespect to others. You need to have been there and experienced it in that particular way. I have seen the grieving in the Maronite community when a death occurs. I have had the grieving in my own family. Those outside the particular communities sometimes do not quite get how much a death can affect you, even if it is not a relative's death. A spiritual leader is something even more than a relative in those communities because of the spiritual link and what is given to those communities by their spiritual leader in terms of leadership and, indeed, when a death occurs within those communities, how the spiritual leader sensitively deals with the families. So they are regarded in each and every household in those communities as part and parcel of the family itself. They are a valued component of the individual family. I do grieve with them. I recognise that I can never grieve in this instance at the depth of their grief. I commend my colleagues for their thoughts and associate myself with everything that has been said to today.

                     Pope Shenouda certainly achieved many great things during his lifetime. Throughout his term as the patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church he was a widely respected spiritual leader and he will be sadly missed. His Holiness was born Nazeer Gayed on 3 August 1923 to a very pious

His Holiness was indeed a man of God his entire life and will be sadly missed by a great multitude of people throughout the world, including the Coptic community here in Australia and in my electorate.

I know that the students of St Mary's will be mourning their beloved Pope, because His Holiness had a deep affection for children and as a learned man himself invested very strongly in education.

                      Deep faith is a significant part of the Coptic identity, and nowhere is this more evident than in the surrounds of the Melbourne Coptic Orthodox monastery in Donvale, purchased for the Coptic Diocese by the community under the leadership of Bishop Suriel. It is a very beautiful building and is a wonderful place for parishioners and visitors alike. I speak about the monastery because it has indeed become a symbol of Coptic faith and a safe refuge for Coptic Australians, who well appreciate the freedoms they enjoy in this countryâ€”their new home Australia. They enjoy the freedom to express their identity and pursue their faith without fear or persecution.

                      The same, however, cannot be said about their Coptic brothers and sisters living in Egypt, whom they have never forgotten or abandoned, especially in their hour of needâ€”and there have been many hours of need in the history of Egypt's Coptics, most recently the persecution that occurred in the lead-up to and aftermath of the Egyptian uprising that began about a year ago. The House has heard on a number of occasions about the indiscriminate killings of innocent Copts, the burning of churches and the slaying of Coptic priests. In fact, it was just last year that I attended a prayer vigil in

                      </a>
                      to protest against the killings that had taken place during the Egyptian uprising. The vigil was attended by dozens of community leaders and hundreds of people, including a broad coalition of Christian churches, who stood together with Bishop Suriel in support of

                      . This unity of Christian churches was something Pope Shenouda championed and affirmed and was recognised by Roman Catholic Pope Benedict, who recalled with gratitude Pope Shenouda's commitment to Christian unity.

                      His Holiness Pope Shenouda was never far from his flock, and the Coptic community in faraway Australia drew strength and inspiration from his leadership, especially his leadership on the defence of human rights. He himself spent a period of time in jail in the course of advocating and defending the human rights of his people. Pope Shenouda first visited Australia in November 1989. His Holiness met with the then Prime Minister

                      It was during one of his subsequent visits to Australia that I had the privilege of meeting him. In fact, I had just become the member for Calwell and was invited to attend one of the welcoming events put on for him by the Coptic community in Melbourne. I had never seen such a devout and dedicated community. The affection they had for Pope Shenouda was indeed palpable, such was his charisma and, at the same time, his humility. Pope Shenouda's spiritual contribution to his flock was highly regarded and respected. His life's achievements are a reflection of the enormous contribution the Coptic community has made to Australia.

                      The Coptics are an established and educated community, who never cease to give back to the country they now call home. Pope Shenouda was a man larger than life with deeply held convictions. He died on 17 March 2012 of lung and liver complications, at the age of 88. During the night of his death an estimated 10,000 mourners were said to have visited his body at

                       My father had a saying that people who never make any decisions never make any mistakes. That was perhaps applicable of Pope Shenouda. He has been criticised at various stages for perhaps being too close to the Egyptian authorities, in the case of Mubarak particularlyâ€”and welcoming his son as a possible presidential candidateâ€”and for trying to make sure that the Copts were not involved in the early demonstrations in Tahrir Square et cetera. He has also been criticised by diasporas of Copts around the world because he did not support foreign intervention in the affairs of Egypt in support of the Christian minority. I always think on these matters that it is very easy for various ethnic diasporas in Australia to be very radical about events in their homeland when the people who get the bullets in the head are actually there rather than here in Australia.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       He has been criticised on occasion for his role but one must say that it is a very difficult situation when Christians are discriminated against by
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_II" rel="nofollow">
                        Article II

                       , which says that there is pre-eminence for Islamic law; where there have been restrictions on the construction of their churches; and where there have on occasions been state connected attacks on them and the police and other authorities have not been protective of them. He had to tread a very difficult road. We are talking about a minority of approximately 10 per centâ€”estimates vary from eight to 12 million. He also very strongly supported the rights of the Palestinian people, refusing to accompany Sadat to Jerusalem.

                      <p>
                       I met him on one occasion, during his visit to Australia. The point made about him by previous speakers is that he was a very practical person who could be persuaded by arguments. He was lobbied about a church that was being blocked in Guildford, in the Parramatta municipality. He was worded up by the local Copts about how dreadful it was with the discrimination against them. I was able to persuade him that when a council votes 20-0â€”Liberals, Independents and Laborâ€”against the application there might be something wrong with the development application. He actually appreciated that argument.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       During the visit in 2002 he separated the new

                       and consecrated Bishop Daniel to undertake that. I will repeat part of the quote of

                       given by the previous speaker by saying that he was 'an advocate for unity and reconciliation'. That reiterates the point made by the Reverend Olav Fykse Tveit of the

                      <p>
                       We in Australia appreciate the very strong presence of the Coptic community. They have essentially come here on two main grounds: refugee-humanitarian, which is a recognition of their suppression and continuing struggles in Egypt; and there is a very high proportion of skilled migrants. That is a characteristic of many communities that are suppressed, whether it is Tamils, the Palestinians or a variety of other groups. They see education and professional careers as their only way out of these kinds of conditions.

                      <p>
                       We, of course, mourn with the communities, recognising his historic role from 1971. In that period, he spent three years in isolation when Sadat stripped him of his powers of leadership of his community. He was also very critical of the trend in Egypt, where Sadat in particular decided to defeat the left and the unions and the progressive liberals; he had actually appealed to the fundamentalists. That created part of the problem in Egypt, with the government relying on fundamentalists to suppress the political left.

                      <p>
                       I want to join with the very strong community in this country, predominantly in Sydneyâ€”about seven-tenths of them; it is a community contributing very strongly to our country in regard to many of our professionsâ€”in recognising his historic role and the symbol he has been for significant numbers of people outside Egypt as well as those within.

                        Pope Shenouda's 40-year papacy achieved a great deal for the Coptic Orthodox Church. It was just as significant in building relationships with other faiths. He was a conservative figure within the church and was also respected within the Muslim community, who represent the largest faith group in Egypt. He maintained very good relations with Muslim leaders in Egypt and attended many Muslim summits, where he gave speeches. He was well versed in the Koran, often quoted from it when meeting with Muslims. Pope Shenouda was also known for his commitment to ecumenism and had long advocated interdenominational Christian dialogue. He devoted his writings, teachings and actions to spreading and propagating the rules of understanding, peace, dialogue and forgiveness. He was very much a nationalist and volunteered to serve in the

                        Sadly, as the Arab Spring gripped Egypt last year, his church and the flock he devoted 60 years to became the target for unjustifiable hate crimes, which I have spoken about in this place on a number of occasions.

It was completely and utterly unacceptable that people, as they were celebrating their faith, were subjected to that violence. His presence among his people throughout this difficult time would have been comforting to his large church, not just in Egypt but throughout the world. His long and distinguished papacy represented stability and continuity for a church under threat. His passing will be deeply felt throughout the Christian world, but nowhere more than in his homeland of Egypt. To Copts everywhere and particularly those that I am proud to represent within the Chifley electorate, I offer my heartfelt condolence at his passing.
