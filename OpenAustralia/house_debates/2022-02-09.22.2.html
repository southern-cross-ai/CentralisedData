       <p>
        This morning I was advised of the passing of one of my community's great citizens, Mr Harry Hunt,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Harry was affectionately known as 'Mr Liverpool', and anyone who has driven down the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Hume Highway
        </a>
        to Canberra would have passed the motel he had owned and operated for about 50 years. Mr Hunt, for many years, was the president of the local chamber of commerce, always talking to anyone who would listen about the wonderful community that is Liverpool and the opportunities he saw for betterment in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        For more than 20 years, Harry hosted a Christmas lunch for significant numbers of our disadvantaged community members because he wanted to ensure that everyone would enjoy Christmas and their community. He was always a generous sponsor and supporter of fundraising events in our community. On a personal note, he was generous with his support and counsel to me and my other colleagues who represent our community, more than willing to provide helpful advice and encouragement. Harry was always smiling infectiously about life and the opportunities it held.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the loss to our community is immense and will be felt keenly in the days and years to come, it will be so much worse for his family. I send my condolences to Sybra and their family, from me and our community at this sad time. Vale, Harry Hunt. Thank you for everything you've done.
       </p>
