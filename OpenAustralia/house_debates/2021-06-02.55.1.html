        I rise today as a proud Victorian and a proud Australian to say thank you to the tens of thousands of Victorians who are getting tested every day during this lockdown and to the tens of thousands getting vaccinated during this lockdown. I want to thank those who have been close contacts who are isolating. I want to thank those who are staying at home and keeping the rest of this country safe because there is no doubt this lockdown in Victoria is about keeping the rest of Australia safe, so we're doing our bit in Victoria and we're doing our bit in a situation where we know the federal government has failed in the vaccine rollout, they have failed in quarantine—two of their only jobs—but, more importantly, they are failing now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just now, outside this House, the member for Kooyong, who claims to be for forgotten Australians, who has forgotten 6.6 million fellow Victorians, has doubled down and said this federal government will offer no support for workers and no extra support for businesses in Victoria. So while in Victoria we're busy keeping people safe, the member for Kooyong has turned into someone who talks about potato scallops; the man has gone mad. He needs to come into this place and support Victorians who have no work this week because they're casuals, who are struggling to pay the rent and the mortgage this week because they're casuals. This federal government needs to take responsibility. They won't learn anything until they do.

         Mr Speaker, you will agree with me that today in Victoria we have many people in distress, including in your own electorate. I have spoken to my colleague the member for Calwell. She has a number of issues around her electorate that are most difficult to deal with at this time. Every one of us, whatever side of this House we're on, are facing great difficulties. Even my own family are struggling to find out what they can and what they can't do, what my daughter is able to do with her daughter and what my wife is able to do. I wouldn't be a stranger in that place and none of us are strangers in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are people who are under great stress today and we identify, as Victorians, with every one of them. Our heart goes out to them, our care goes out to them and every effort is being put in on their behalf to make sure the most vulnerable are cared for. In this, we are all Australians and we are all Victorians. It's important for this nation to know what is happening. Maria is here now. Maria, thank you for the work you're doing on behalf of your constituents and we're doing as much we can on behalf of ours. That's Victoria together. We will stay together and we'll do this together, and Victorians will rise to the occasion and do the best they can in the conditions they are surrounded by.
