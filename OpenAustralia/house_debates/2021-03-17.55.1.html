        There are some moments in our history when marketing won't work and spin won't work. There are moments that require us to reach in and find our humanity. I'm really proud to stand here today to say that I watched a moment like that this week. I watched the member for Grayndler as he listened to the speakers on the lawn on Monday. I watched him listen, I watched him internalise and then I watched him walk into this House and give expression to his humanity.
       </p>

        Sadly, our Prime Minister has failed to do the same. Our Prime Minister has shown us inside himself this week, with references to the mob and to the notion that we're lucky not to be shot marching in front of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . He has not only missed the moment; he has shown me what makes him tick. This moment can't be managed. This moment can't be spun. The Prime Minister needs to understand that the women of Australia are not only standing up to be heard but feeling that we have been heard by most men in this country. He should join those ranks as quickly as he can. He should reach in and find his humanity and stand with the women of Australia.
