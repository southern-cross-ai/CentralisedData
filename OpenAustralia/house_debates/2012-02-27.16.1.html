        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Royce Giblin, along with his playing partner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gibson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , on their recent victory in the Riverside veterans four-ball best ball stableford golf tournament, in February. Royce has been a beacon of the Launceston community for many years. He ended his 35-year career in the police working as a senior constable in Launceston, ignoring overtures for further promotions in order to remain as a hands-on police officer in the community. Since his retirement, Royce has taken on the role of assisting with the rehabilitation of a local man who was involved in a car accident and unfortunately now has a disability. Royce takes him to golf and really assists him. This shows that Royce's thirst for helping out in the community is still as strong as ever. This community mindedness can also be found in Royce's family, with his son Phil and daughter-in-law Raelene both becoming life members of

         Launceston Football Club
        </a>
        . Raelene was also named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        volunteer of the year. I would like to thank Royce and his family for the hard work they do in my wonderful community of Bass. I once again congratulate Royce on his recent win and wish him many more happy hours on the golf course.
