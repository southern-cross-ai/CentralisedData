        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cross" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        Upon finishing his career in the Defence Force David Thomson ran a guesthouse before his election to parliament. Turning his hand to politics in 1975, he was elected as the National Country Party member for the federal division of Leichhardt in 1975, reclaiming a seat the Labor Party had held for the preceding 24 years. In December 1979 David Thomson was appointed Minister for Science and the Environment before his appointment as Minister for Science and Technology in November of the following year. He retained that portfolio until the defeat of the Fraser government on 5 March 1983. It was at this election that David Thomson also lost his seat, the then bellwether seat of Leichhardt, to Labor's John Gayler. Above all, John Sullivan remembered his friend and parliamentary colleague as 'a bloody good soldier, a bloody good member and a bloody good bloke'.

        Aged 88, David Thomson passed away on 13 October this year in
