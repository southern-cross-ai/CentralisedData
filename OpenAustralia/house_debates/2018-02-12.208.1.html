        Since 20 January this year, the people of Afrin in northern Syria have been under heavy bombardment from Turkish armed forces as part of an incursion into Syria. On 6 February, the

         UN
        </a>
        resident humanitarian coordinator of Syria released a statement condemning the military operations in Afrin which have trapped civilians. The Syrian Observatory for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">

        reported that, as at the end of January, there had already been 67 civilian deaths and nearly 200 injured as a result of the Turkish air strikes. Air strikes have also destroyed a 3,000-year-old Neo-Hittite temple built around 1300

        . Turkish officials, including their foreign minister, have stated that the intention of the operation is to rid Afrin of terrorist elements, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS" rel="nofollow">

        , although there is no ISIS presence in Afrin. The population of Afrin is under a secular administration, the

        , the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led, multiethnic, pro-women's-rights group in Syria. They've been a key ally for the

        Sadly, despite a relatively positive start to his administration, President Erdogan's rule has, over 3Â½ years, become increasingly authoritarian, devolving into fear, the persecution of minorities such as Kurds, the breakdown of democratic foundations and the dissolution of human rights. While Australia has had a shared history and an important relationship with Turkey since
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        and while the relationship between our nations is important, the federal government must condemn the Turkish President's incursion into Afrin. I call on the Australian government to make direct representations to the Turkish government, imploring them to halt operations immediately, before there are any more civilian casualties.
