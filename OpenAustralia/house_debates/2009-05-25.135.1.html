       <p>
        I recently visited the Lake Joondalup Lifestyle Village in Ashby to see the public performance of the Village Vaudeville Group. The Village Vaudeville Group’s show was presented by the village’s social club. Although I have been to the Lake Joondalup Lifestyle Village on many occasions, this was the first time I had seen the show. I was greatly impressed. The vaudeville group comprised eight women and six men. They entertained the audience for more than two hours.

        For a great show I would commend Lorrie Baillie, Bonnie Bonnick, Ian Carswell,

        , Wilf Green, Marcia Lockett, Joan Nelson, Pat Neenan, Frank Quicke, Helen Quicke, John Ruddle and Dave Whitehouse. I commend them as a group and for their solo performances as well. With their strong voices, they certainly did not struggle to hold a note. Although there were many people involved in the entire show, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the director, Helen Quicke; lighting and sound operator Wally Fry; and stage hands Inge and

        As with many amateur productions, not everything went according to plan. Prior to the performance I saw, musical director and pianist Ian Halliday was struck down with a serious eye problem. He is due to be operated upon tomorrow and I wish him all the best for the operation and a speedy recovery.

        for the evening was Ian’s wife, Jenny Halliday, and she did a great job despite her obvious concern for her husband. It was fortunate that Lin Brown, an accomplished pianist, was able to step in for Ian and the show went ahead. I congratulate the Lake Joondalup Lifestyle Village Vaudeville Group for a fabulous performance.
