        Last month the Grafton community farewelled one of its greatest advocates for the disabled, the aged and many other causes—Joan Muir. She was 96. After serving with the

        , Joan came back to Grafton with her husband and became a teacher at the Caringa special school—a school for children with disabilities. She was a teacher there for more than two decades. She was later made a life member of Caringa Enterprises, which the school had become.

        In the late sixties, Joan joined the Clarence Village association to advocate for the aged. Today, the meeting hall at Clarence Village bears her name in recognition of her tireless work. She was a member of numerous organisations that are too many to name. For these, she received an

He was a member of the Yamba Surf Life Saving Club from 1952—a life member—and remained an active member, performing patrols, competing, coaching and administrating the club for over five decades. His love of sport was profound. He is survived by his two children, Michelle and Paul, and his grandchildren, Chris and Timothy. Rest in peace, Max.

        The Evans Head Bombers are the smallest club in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League community, but this doesn't stop them scoring tries for local charities. On 5 August the Evans Head Bombers took on the Murwillumbah Mustangs for their sixth annual charity day to raise money for cystic fibrosis. The day was a great success, raising over $10,000. It brings the amount they've raised to over $40,000. This isn't the first time that they've raised money for a charity. Previously, they've raised more than $7,000 for local charity

        , as part of their Think Pink Cancer Awareness Day. It was a culmination of work by organisers Maree Butcher and Alma Keogh. This year, Cystic Fibrosis Day was driven by Tahli Butler, Rockett Milsom and Taysha Butler, who are the coordinators of the fundraising team. There were over 20 sponsors from the local community, who also donated auction items to this event. This event could not have been possible without the support of the rugby league community. I'd also like to acknowledge the auctioneer, Brian O'Farrell, club president Grant McGeary, treasurer Jo Slade, committee member Annie Dries, and all the community who supported this project.
