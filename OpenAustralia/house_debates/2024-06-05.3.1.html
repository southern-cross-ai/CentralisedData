        (1) notes that following the dire State of the Environment Report released in 2021, the Government promised to act decisively to turn the tide in this country from nature destruction to nature repair;

        (2) places on record its concern that:
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        (c) despite this new emphasis on the importance of the expanded water trigger, fossil fuel projects which are caught by the trigger have not been referred to or called in by the Minister for the Environment and Water for assessment;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further notes its concern that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has now introduced 'Stage 2' of its nature positive reforms (being the establishment of Environment Protection Australia (

         EPA

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) to be effective, the EPA should have an independent board, clear, legislated objectives, and be properly funded from commencement;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Government has now resiled from its commitment to introduce 'Stage 3' of the nature positive reforms (comprising the substantive, urgent and significant reform of the underlying environment laws) in this term of government; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Government has no current plan to implement its promise to enhance protections for critical habitat or threatened species in this term of government; and

        (4) calls on the Government, as part of its 'Stage 2' nature positive reforms, to:

        (a) remove two current exemptions in the

       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review was handed down on 3 June 2024;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges the decision means:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) 2.6 million low paid workers on awards or the minimum wage will receive a pay rise of 3.75 per cent from 1 July 2024;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) fulltime workers on the minimum wage will receive an extra $33.10 per week, or $1,721 per year; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that since the election of the Government, the minimum wage has increased by $143.30 per week and by $7,451.60 per year;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further acknowledges the Government has delivered on its commitment for Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn while also delivering cost of living relief without adding to inflation with measures such as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer;

        (f) increased support payments; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) further notes that leaked plans from the Opposition reveal they want Australians to work longer for less by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) making it easier to sack people by removing criteria including 'procedural fairness' and 'harshness' from unfair dismissal protections;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) abolishing the better off overall test;
       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) before the 2022 election, the federal Labor Party committed 'to cooperate with the states and territories to improve the timeliness and quality of road trauma data and look for opportunities to extract better quality road safety data from states and territories in return for funding of road projects'; and

        That this House:

        (1) notes that the reduction in the provision of maternity services in rural Australia:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) has increased significantly since the 1990s due to closure of rural maternity services and centralisation of services to metropolitan areas;

        (b) greatly increases the chances of a woman having her baby outside of appropriate maternity services;

        (c) increases the risk of complications for both mother and baby; and

        (2) calls on the Government to:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) remove the structural barriers and address any outstanding funding recommendations to primary maternity care as outlined in the Medicare Benefits Schedule's report of Participating Midwives Reference Group, and the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's inquiry into the universal access to reproductive healthcare, both of which included recommendations for supporting rural maternity services; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) ensure funding agreements with the states and territories enforce the provision of adequate rural maternity services through the Rural Birthing Index, and provide direction for the types of state-based maternity services that should be operating in rural communities.
