       <p>
        I rise today to put on public record some very exciting news and to congratulate two businesses in my electorate: Dingo Australia, located in Dalby in the eastern part of my electorate; and Tambo Teddies, located, obviously, in Tambo on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsborough_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Landsborough Highway
        </a>
        in Central Western Queensland. Last December these businesses were recognised for their outstanding use of digital technologies in the 2015 Regional Online Heroes initiative, which is run by the Regional Australia Institute and Google.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Regional Online Heroes initiative recognises businesses that use the internet to grow, reach new customers and give back to the community. I am pleased to put on the public record today that Dingo Australia, located in Dalby, was selected as one of the 10 finalists in the 2015 national competition, and that the overall national winner was Tambo Teddies. This is an extraordinary achievement. I know the owners and operators of these businesses and where they are located, and it truly is an extraordinary achievement for both of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dingo Australia, for instance, manufactures mini-loaders and mini-diggers and is one of the few equipment manufacturers left in Australia. By using online platforms, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
         YouTube
        </a>
        and Facebook, to promote their products, Dingo Australia was able to increase their inquiries fourfold whilst simultaneously halving their marketing budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, Tambo Teddies used the internet and social media platforms to promote and sell their products overseas. Tambo Teddies was set up in the middle of the drought and was struggling against the wool market crash way back in the 1990s. Three ladies who put their entrepreneurship and creativity to work decided to use discarded wool products to make teddy bears and, since then, Tambo Teddies has grown and is fast becoming an iconic international brand. Tambo Teddies have been gifted throughout Australia and around the world, including to His Royal Highness Prince George.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to once again congratulate both of these businesses that have highlighted the growing power of social media, the importance of digital communications and the need for high-quality, high-speed internet in rural, regional and remote parts of Australia. These are quite clearly examples of the power of the internet and the opportunities available to small and medium businesses in my electorate to grow their businesses and, obviously, to keep businesses manufacturing in those regional, rural and remote townships.
