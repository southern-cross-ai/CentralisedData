       <p>
        I would like to follow on from the previous speaker in talking about the importance of community leadership. If you want to see community leadership, the member for Indie only need come down to the wonderful electorate of Goldstein, where we see community leadership every day. The place I would like to start is with the Bayside Church, which celebrated its 25th anniversary last weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bayside Church is a consequence of hard work by Rob Buckingham and his wonderful wife, Christie, who came together many years ago and saw the opportunity for a church based around the Cheltenham area to work with and support religious communities in the area. It started in a funeral parlour and has gone on to grow and develop into its own site in a nearby industrial area.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I say to senior minister Rob and his wife, Christie, and all of those people—including Sandra Cavello and the wonderful supporters they have, the hundreds who were there who celebrated the incredible anniversary with me—congratulations on your achievement. Congratulations on your 25 years that have come. Congratulations on the 25 years that are yet to come. And congratulations on all of your hard work in bringing the Goldstein community together to celebrate and promote, respect and love your fellow human beings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing is to look at the amazing amount of work that has been done at a community level, particularly with local scouting groups. On the weekend I was very privileged to go down to the 5th and 6th Central Moorabbin Scout Group, which is just outside the electorate of Goldstein in the federal electorate of Hotham. Nonetheless, they had a wonderful community day in their new scout hall, which got support from local Rotary groups and the local council.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each works together with the scouting group to make sure that scouts continue to have an enduring presence in our community. I want to pay particular respect to the group leader, Geoff Gartly, who I was honoured to be with in part of the presentation. He even made me a scout patrol leader on the day. I do not think the deputy leader of the troop, Nick Staikos, appreciated being my deputy but, Nick, I just want to say to you how much I appreciate your support now and into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also other wonderful events in Goldstein, like the

        fair. I would particularly like to thank the principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         Stuart Davis
        </a>
        , on bringing this important community day together and finding so many people to do such a wonderful job in making sure that the Goldstein community on, let's put it bluntly, an angelic day—that was the wonder of the weather on the weekend—had the opportunity not just to go outdoors but to enjoy the wonderful spirit of community. Equally I thank the Caulfield Primary School and their principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gray" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Gray
        </a>
        , who had a similar experience on Sunday down at Caulfield Primary School, where there was a wonderful coordination of events, particularly by Ben Marshman, who did a fabulous job bringing everybody together.
