       <p>
        I was very pleased recently that Jenny Aitchison, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        shadow minister for the prevention of domestic violence but also the New South Wales shadow minister for small business, visited my electorate on the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        . First in her capacity as shadow minister for small business we attended the Murwillumbah District Business Chamber breakfast where the shadow minister addressed the group and she heard from many local businesses in the region about the challenges and the opportunities that they face.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenny Aitchison, though now the state member for Maitland, had previously operated a small business with her husband, and she outlined the history of that business to the chamber. It was very interesting and informative. The members of the chamber were so pleased that a shadow minister for small business not only had come to their chamber breakfast to listen to and talk with them but also had such extensive small business experience. That was very valued and we had a great roundtable with all of the participants there as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the executive of the Murwillumbah District Business Chamber, including, but not limited to,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vincent" rel="nofollow">
         David Vincent
        </a>
        , Natascha Wernick and Ilze Jaunberzins, for their very kind invitation. I pay tribute to the hard work they do in both the business and broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will also make mention of Ilze's capacity as member and representative of Women's Watch. This is a group that was established in the aftermath of the very harsh closure of the Tweed Valley Women's Service. As I have told the House before, in Christmas 2015 the Tweed Valley Women's Service had their contract cancelled and their funding slashed by their lead agency, On Track. The subsequent complete inaction by the New South Wales government and the North Coast National Party MPs over the closure of this service was both shameful and irresponsible. As both state members showed they were unwilling or unable to do the job they were elected to do, I launched a petition demanding that the New South Wales government restore the funding to the service. The community worked very hard with Women's Watch and, in just over 12 months, we achieved our goal of reaching over 10,000 signaturesâ€”a great achievement. Reaching this threshold means that a debate on the closure of this vital service will now be triggered in the New South Wales parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also as part of the shadow minister's visit to my electorate she met with Women's Watch for the handover and presentation of the petition. I would like to thank Jenny Aitchison for coming to the North Coast and for taking this important petition to the state parliament. I also want to thank the community and applaud everyone for their victory in achieving more than 10,000 signatures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further to the handover of this petition, the shadow minister hosted a roundtable on domestic violence. I thank all the local stakeholders from around the region who attended and contributed to the discussion on how we can continue to work together to stop domestic violence and improve support for all those affected. We discussed a whole range of issues, including support services, policing, health, housing, education and also legislative reform. It was great to have the input, experience and real commitment to working together that was shown by all the stakeholders who attended.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would again like to thank Jenny Aitchison for her visit the New South Wales North Coast and for meeting with so many local groups. I would also like to commend her on the great work she is doing right throughout New South Wales.
