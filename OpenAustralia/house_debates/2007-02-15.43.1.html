         , the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Bureau of Meteorology. The Treasury, of course, has not constructed a model in relation to climate change, but as part of its role in advising the government it has undertaken extensive qualitative analysis of all the global literature in relation to this matter, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK

         government’s Stern review and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         assessments. The Stern review uses an integrated assessment model to make projections of the global impact of climate change. As far as the Treasury is aware, no country has developed a model of national consequences. All of the models that have been developed are in relation to global consequences. The Stern review itself says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Making such estimates is a formidable task … It is also a computationally demanding exercise, with the result that such models must make drastic, often heroic, simplifications along all stages of the climate-change chain. What is more, large uncertainties are associated with each element in the cycle.

        <p>
         That does not mean that it is not worth doing, and I think the Stern report was worth doing, although, as I have previously informed the House—

          <p>
           The member for Grayndler has had one of those enlightened moments. As I have previously informed the House, it was well worth doing, although the Treasury, as it has given evidence in relation to the matter, had serious disagreements with the way in which it was done. I think I would be correct in saying the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           treasury itself had some serious disagreements with the Stern inquiry. But that does not mean it was not worth doing; it most definitely was worth doing. The assessments that the Treasury have done in relation to that in fact profited from that. If somebody were to go on from that and say that the government has not done any work, they would be seriously wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
           I cannot leave this question without observing that the member for

             I’m astonished the Treasurer hasn’t had his eye on the ball for climate change.

               I am listening carefully to the Treasurer. It would appear that he is quoting from an interview that had something to do with climate change, which I think was the point of the question. I call the Treasurer, but, given the time, I hope he is drawing his answer to a conclusion.

                Let me make this observation: whereas the Labor Party cannot bring itself to have a position on this base at Geraldton, they do not have much trouble in getting a position on
