       <p>
        I rise today to recognise the terrific work of the Edwardstown Meals on Wheels branch. A couple of weeks ago I was privileged to spend the morning volunteering with the branch, when I donned the apron and assisted preparing meals. It was good, when I was preparing the meals, to talk to some of the volunteers who have been providing valuable services for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also enjoyed the opportunity to help deliver the meals. I joined Kim, who is a job seeker; Colin, the volunteer coordinator; Brenda, Stephanie and Don—a handful of others of the over 100 incredible Edwardstown Weals on Wheels volunteers. The Edwardstown Meals on Wheels prepares an average of 120 meals a day and have delivered over 1½ million meals for all those in need in the Hindmarsh the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I learnt firsthand about the support received from Meals on Wheels—and it is more than just a meal. From Plympton to Glandore and Edwardstown, they took me on a journey. People took us into their homes and welcomed our attendance and support—the social contact. I witnessed first hand the great appreciation of the visits of the Meals on Wheels volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank President Colin and his wife and secretary Maria Humphreys for the invitation to join them for the morning. In closing, I also want to pay tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Edwardstown, which provides a driver each day for the Edwardstown Meals on Wheels.

         The Rotary Club

        helped set up the Meals on Wheels branch many years ago. It is a great example of the two organisations working together.
