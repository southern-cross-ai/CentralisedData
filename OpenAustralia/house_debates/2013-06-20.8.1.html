        That, in accordance with section 5 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament Act
        </a>
        1974, the House approve the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 17 June 2013, namely:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) pay parking infrastructure, including machines, signage and minor civil engineering works necessary for the introduction of pay parking in the Parliamentary Zone; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) relocation of the Torsional Wave outdoor exhibit to the corner of King George Terrace and Mall Road West adjacent to the Questacon Building.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital Authority
        </a>
        proposes to install paid parking voucher machines and signage within the Parliamentary Zone. The National Capital Authority will also commission some minor civil works, such as the construction of additional traffic islands for the successful implementation of this initiative. The installation of this equipment will assist the National Capital Authority in better managing parking in that zone, which has become a problem of late, freeing up much-needed parking space for visitors to our many national institutions in that zone. The works are not inconsistent with relevant policies and strategies in the heritage management plans for the area and will have minimal impact on environment and heritage values. I commend that part of the motion to the House.
       </p>

        Also in November last year approval was provided for an outdoor exhibit in a location to the west of Questacon. The National Capital Authority has now received an application for an amended location for the exhibitâ€”that being on the corner of King Edward Terrace and Mall Road West. Questacon proposes to install the torsional wave outdoor exhibit, which I understand is a sculpture that demonstrates the twisting forces in water. It sounds like a particularly beautiful sculpture. That exhibit was proposed to be installed in November this year to celebrate 25 years as Australia's National Science and Technology Centre. The work is consistent with relevant policies and strategies in the heritage management plans for the area. It is considered that the work will have minimal impact on environment and heritage values. I commend this part of the motion to the House.
