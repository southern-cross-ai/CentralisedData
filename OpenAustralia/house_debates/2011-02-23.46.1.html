        I rise to commend everyone involved with the fantastic new

        Cup. Although the score line was not all that pretty, they played with determination and represented the people of Western Sydney with pride.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some 10,000 supporters packed out the AFL’s new training facility at

        for the historic event. Such was the level of support—it was a capacity crowd—that fans needed to be turned away at the gates. It was also pleasing to see the number of orange jerseys in the crowd, easily matching the well established fan base of the

        I praise the outstanding work done by Tony Shepherd,

        and all the support staff involved with the Giants. Saturday night was the culmination of months of hard work and years of vision and foresight. I particularly acknowledge the passion and dedication of Kevin Sheedy. Kevin was recently asked if he was worried about the competition for athletes by the differing codes in Western Sydney. Kevin replied:

        You know who is going to win? The 12-year-old kids. It’s about getting great opportunities for Australian kids. That’s the way I look at it. We win. The country feels proud. What is the backlash of giving an Australian kid a chance?
