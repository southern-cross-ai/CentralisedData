        I seek leave to move amendments (1) and (3), as circulated in my name, together.

        Leave not granted.

        I move amendment (1), as circulated in my name:

        (1) Clause 2, page 2 (at the end of the table), add:
       </p>
       <p>
        I have put to this chamber some important amendments. They are best practice, and they are the gold standard for how a government should spend public money. They would also end pork-barrelling, a corrupt practice that buys votes and that Australians are absolutely sick and tired of. My amendments would require all grants programs to have clear and publicly available merit-based selection criteria and guidelines. A requirement for each grant program to have guidelines and selection criteria might seem perfectly obvious, but right now it is optional under the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines. This has serious consequences for fairness in spending public money. It means that public money can be spent without rules and safeguards. Clearly, this is ridiculous, and these amendments will fix this so that the government can be upfront about who can apply for grants and the criteria that must be satisfied to be awarded that grant. We are talking about tens of billions of taxpayers' dollars after all.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is common sense. This is the very least that our nation would expect of any government. I think this is very fair and sensible amendment, and I asked the government to consider that amendment.

          My amendment goes to robust reporting to parliament. Again, I would say it is absolutely fundamental that parliament is dealt into decisions when it comes to how taxpayers' monies are spent. We need to know, as a nation and as a parliament, not only that grants have fair, transparent and publicly available guidelines and selection criteria, as I mentioned in my first amendment, but also that, when a minister decides to make a decision that is not in line with the recommendations from the department, they come to the parliament and report those in a timely manner. This is really best practice about who is best placed to receive a grant. There may indeed be legitimate reasons why a minister decides to go against departmental advice, and they should have no problem in coming to the parliament to do that.
         </p>
         <p>
          In responding to this amendment, the government may well say that there's already a Senate order requiring the finance minister to report on which ministers have awarded grants against official advice. But, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, I put it to you and to the government that this happens once a year. It hardly achieves the transparency and accountability we should all expect. And, in the meantime, while we're waiting for that once-a-year special revelation, we shouldn't have to wait for a media investigation or indeed an audit report to uncover pork-barrelling.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is an important amendment. It's not a difficult amendment. It's one that could easily be accepted by the government. To be frank, I'm at a loss to understand why the government would wish to oppose such a sensible amendment.

            My remaining amendments would create a joint parliamentary committee on grants administration and investment mandates. This committee will oversee grants administration, including compliance with guidelines. Grants over $100 million would be referred to the committee for additional oversight.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are sensible amendments, and I thank the Centre for Public Integrity for working with me on them. They're gold standard amendments. They have support from some of the most experienced and respected legal minds in this country—indeed, the same legal minds that the now government called upon frequently when in opposition, when they were railing in this place against the alleged pork-barrelling of the former government.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's an extraordinary situation, to be truthful, that anyone in this place would have a problem with any of these amendments, which, quite frankly, irrespective of whether you're in government or opposition—or, indeed, whether you sit in the golden spot on the crossbench—only seek to make us all do better. I call on all members of this place from all political parties to back me in these reforms and not turn a blind eye to my efforts to end pork-barrelling just because it's something that everyone does. That's something our teenagers say to us: 'Everyone else is doing it; let's do it too.' We should be so much better than that. I say: back my amendments, end pork-barrelling and go with me on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            My next amendments, amendments (2) and (4), replicate the current Minister for Finance's own private member's bill introduced in the Senate in 2021. For those members sitting here right now listening to this, I implore you to go and have a look at that bill. This is your own finance minister's bill. It was called the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Improved Grants Reporting) Bill 2021. Those amendments put by Senator Gallagher at the time would force ministers who award grants in their own electorate or against departmental recommendations to report the decision to the finance minister within just 30 days of the approval, and then the finance minister has to table that report in the parliament within five sitting days. That was in the finance minister's very own bill. As I said before, the government might say that ministers currently do this once a year. But it really isn't good enough, and I would argue that the Minister for Finance thinks it isn't good enough either. It really stifles transparency in government grant-making.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm saying to the government: if you can't accept my 'end pork-barrelling' amendments as they stand, then support your own finance minister in what she was seeking to do. When the senator introduced her 'improved grants reporting' bill, she said that her bill:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … will dramatically reduce the time ministers are able to hide their dodgy decisions from the Australian community, and there is no reasonable argument for any senator in this place—
           </p>
           <p>
            and, I would say, any member in this House—
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            particularly those on the government benches, to oppose this bill.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know all too well about dodgy decisions. The member for Curtin just mentioned a particularly egregious and well-publicised one. I have spoken about them at length, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
             Australian National Audit Office
            </a>
            has reported on them at length and, indeed, members of the current government have been very noisy in the past about these things.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that Senator Gallagher, like me, supports integrity in public expenditure. I thank her and other members of the government for meeting with me to discuss these amendments. I think that if the government fails to support amendments that simply replicate a bill previously introduced by their own finance minister then, really, I don't know what to say! So I call on them to dial up on their own integrity and to support these amendments.

             <p>
              Thank you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, for your indulgence. I would like to thank all members who have contributed to the debate, including the member for Indi and the member for Curtin for their contributions. I will make a few remarks in relation to those in a moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              This bill has a long history. Members in this place who have been here for a while will understand the long history to this bill arising out of a series of High Court decisions in the Williams matter. The objective of this bill is to put beyond doubt spending decisions—in particular, grant decisions by the Commonwealth. The purpose and effect of the bill will be to put beyond doubt the consistent operation of the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act with how it has been understood to operate. This includes in circumstances where other general legislative authority may be available. The amendments will confirm the validity of government spending programs that rely on section 32B of that act, as well as any other government involvement in companies in reliance on section 39B of the FFSP Act in circumstances where other general powers could be relied on. The changes in the bill simply clarify the position to what has always been the common understanding.
             </p>
             <p>
              In view of other things that are going on in the House, I'll keep my comments in relation to the amendments moved by the member for Indi very, very brief. I have no doubt about the genuineness of the position from which the member for Indi is coming on her amendments. I'll just simply note that the government is committed to increasing transparency and accountability for government decision-making. This follows other steps that we've taken, which you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, and the member for Indi feel very passionately about, including the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the member is aware, and as other members are aware, the Prime Minister has indicated that there is work underway to strengthen the Commonwealth grants framework, including possible enhancements to rules and guidelines which will do everything that goes to the issues motivating the member for Indi's amendments. That includes integrity, accountability, probity and transparency. We're considering these matters in detail and announcements will be made once they're finalised—I can inform the House of those. And, given that we have all this work underway, we believe that it would be pre-emptory to consider and agree to the amendments that have been moved in good faith by the member for Indi and which have been supported by others at this stage.
             </p>
             <p>
              With those brief comments, I commend the bill to the House.

               I thank the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services. As it is necessary to resolve certain questions to enable further questions to be considered in relation to the bill, in accordance with standing order 195, the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration.
