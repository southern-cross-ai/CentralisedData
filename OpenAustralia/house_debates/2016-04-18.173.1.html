        Flynn is a very large and very diverse electorate. It covers 133,000 square kilometres. Many electorates have multiple local governments; Flynn has eight. With the House's indulgence, I would like to run through some of the industries and products region by region.

        I will start off with the Gladstone region. The Gladstone region is home to one of the most magnificent natural harbours in the world, a harbour whose port continues to set new records for tonnage per year. It was 120 million tonnes last year.

It is home to Queensland's largest coal-fired power station. In the energy field it as an oil refinery, shale oil, cement—it has the biggest cement manufacturer in Queensland, which supplies Queensland,
