        I rise this morning to lodge a petition on behalf of Karryne Lake, who is a constitution of mine. Karryne's petition draws the attention of the House and of the people of Australia to the fact that Northern Territorians do indeed abhor the appalling treatment of our livestock in rogue Indonesians abattoirs. However, the blanket ban imposed by the Gillard Labor government has had a significant impact on the Northern Territory's economy. It is an industry worth over $300 million a year and the ban has severely impacted businesses and families—families like Karryne's. While the trade has restarted, the impact is still being felt across northern Australia. As Karryne's representative, she has asked me to remind the House that Territory families are still suffering as a result of the knee-jerk reaction by the Gillard Labor government to ban live exports. Everyone accepts that animal cruelty is wrong. However, blanket banning Australian animals from being exported to Indonesia will not stop the cruelty. If we turn our backs on the trade, we lose our position to negotiate and resolve the issue. My petition has been through the committee and I would like to lodge it.

        On another matter, I would like to bring to the attention of the House, the fantastic win by Territory Thunder against Queensland's Morningside yesterday. It was a 98-point win, which will be forever recorded in the history books as the highest winning grand final margin in Queensland's history. The final score was Territory Thunder 26. 22.178, to Morningside's 12.8.80. Now one supporter said to me, 'Natasha, Morningside was thunderstruck!' Well, I have to agree. It was really wonderful just to see so many supportive Territorians travel to witness history in the making. Jake Dignan was awarded the

The win was also great for Will Farrer, who celebrated his 21st birthday yesterday. He had a fantastic day kicking some great goals and also displaying his marking capability. We all know Andrew Mcleod was a legend in the Crows but he has been even better in the Territory Thunder and it was great watching the game with his dad, Jock. He was as proud as punch, just like the rest of us. We cannot forget coach

         And I am quite sure that there is a standing order somewhere that would prevent me from making a comment on that result!
