       <p>
        Late last year I had the opportunity to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_the_Little_Company_of_Mary" rel="nofollow">
         Sisters of the Little Company of Mary
        </a>
        ,

        </a>
        week multifaith service at Calvary Health Care Bethlehemâ€”which I am sure will interest the member for Lowe. Mary Potter and her devoted sisters established this wonderful hospital and health care centre many years ago in my electorate with the values of hospitality, healing, stewardship and respect. At the launch of Mary Potter Week I had the opportunity to meet many of the original sisters who formed this health care provider in the area of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Caulfield" rel="nofollow">
         South Caulfield
        </a>
        . I am particularly grateful to a lovely woman, Dr Jane Fischer, the Acting Chief Executive of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Bethlehem Hospital
        </a>
        , for organising this ceremony. People from all faiths participated in this ceremony remembering the work of Mary Potter. It opened with a very moving ceremony by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicki_Walker" rel="nofollow">
         Vicki Walker
        </a>
        from Aboriginal Catholic Ministry. She held a land, fire and earth ceremony to open the events of the day. Bethlehem Hospital continues to provide comprehensive care to the people of the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Ports" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The original mission of the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary has been continued by the professionals around Dr Fischer. Their ability to reach out to the community and get support from across the spectrum in our local community is a great credit to them, as they continue their work. I am very pleased to have been involved in this uplifting service and I commend them very much for their continuing work in the vision of that great and selfless exemplar Mary Potter.
