        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection: Will the minister update the House on the benefits for all Australians of a well-managed national security agenda and why it is important to maintain a strong and consistent border protection policy, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I thank him very much not only for the strong stance that he takes in relation to border protection but also for the very compassionate approach he has towards welcoming people into our country that are deserving of a new start in life. One of the great achievements of this government has been that not only have we been able to stop boats but we have been able to get every child out of detention. Labor put 8,000 children into detention. We have closed 17 detention centres. Labor put 50,000 people on 800 boats, and 1,200 people drowned at sea. Now we've changed all of that policy, and we still have the threat. We know that we've turned back 31 boats over the course of the last couple of years. And the people smugglers just treat these human beings like any other commodity—that is, they trade in drugs, in prostitutes, in tobacco; they take money from innocent men, women and children to go on the boats. The people smugglers couldn't care less whether they make it to our shores or they go to the bottom of the ocean. This side of the parliament will never ever allow the Labor Party again to undo the success that we have had in securing our borders.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it is concerning, when you look at some of the comments made by some of those opposite and some people who would seek to come into this place to represent the Labor Party which are directly designed for that very outcome. If you look at the comments of people like

         </a>
         at the moment, who wants to be the member for Bennelong and be an influential voice within the Labor Party, she has, on many occasions, spoken out against the success of the government's policies and wants to wind back the policies, which would see the boats recommence.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the people of Bennelong want a government that has control of our borders, that wants to put national security first, that wants to keep our community safe in this country. And we need to call out people like Kristina Keneally because they are dangerous in trying to undo the border protection policies.

            Kristina Keneally
           </a>
           has tweeted or that she's said on Sky over a long period of time, it is clear that she is wanting to undo regional processing. She's wanting to undo the turning back of boats where it's safe to do so. It is clear that this Leader of the Opposition barely has control of this policy within the Labor Party. The fact is that Kristina Keneally would be a disaster as the member for Bennelong, just as she was a disaster as the Premier of
