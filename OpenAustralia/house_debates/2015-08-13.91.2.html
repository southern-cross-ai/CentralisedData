       </p>
       <p>
        We have no choice but to suspend standing orders when we try to pursue a situation through questions and the Prime Minister cannot even maintain the same answers within the space of 30 minutes. What is the point of trying to pursue this issue through question time? It is one thing when the Prime Minister cannot agree with his Attorney-General; but he cannot even agree with himself between his first answer and his most recent answer. We have somebody before us who is willing to mislead this parliament, who thinks that he can get away with saying one thing and then saying the exact opposite only 30 minutes later and maybe no-one will notice. Well, people will notice, and people need to, because of the situation that has emerged today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The events of today have exposed three things. In the first instance, the royal commissioner is conflicted. He is biased and he is conflicted. Second, if we are to take into account the argument that he has put in his own defence and that others have put in his defence, that maybe he was unaware it was a fundraiser, then he is incompetent. In his job, he is meant to be the person who knows what questions to ask. Checking who is organising an event is not a bad question to ask. So, the royal commissioner is conflicted and biased, or, at best—the best we can end up with out of this—he is incompetent.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the third thing is what this says about the Liberal Party. What we have learnt today is what this says about the Liberal Party. We had the situation previously—and it was a sign that we should have taken notice of—where Ian Harper, at the same time we had the Harper review, was wanting to attend fundraisers for the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        . Maybe we should have realised then that the Liberal Party know absolutely no shame when it comes to misappropriating the requests and doing things the wrong way by having statutory officers engage in fundraising events for their party, because the one group that definitely knew the whole way through how inappropriate this was was the Liberal Party.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberal Party
        </a>
        knew it was a fundraiser when they issued the invitation. The Liberal Party knew exactly what they were doing when they put this request out. When the front cover of the document has the Liberal Party logo, it is probably a hint that it is a Liberal Party function. But, if the Prime Minister does not get the hint at the Liberal Party logo—and we are working on the basis that he may have seen it before—the reason that we have to suspend standing orders and cannot pursue this simply through questions—

           But, if that hint was not taken, maybe this would be a hint that the Prime Minister was willing to own up to at the beginning of question time but scurried away from the moment the questions continued: 'Cheques should be made payable to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Liberal Party of Australia

           division'—probably a political function. But, maybe if he did not twig at that, how about this one, Prime Minister: 'A receipt will be issued. All proceeds from this event will be applied to state election campaigning.' Maybe that is a hint.
          </p>
          <p>
           What we have ended up with is a situation where somebody who was employed and appointed on the basis that he should know what questions to ask and should know something about probity instead has landed us in this situation. Make no mistake; the statement that went out today does not end the issue. Those opposite have wanted to say, 'He has withdrawn; it's over.' But read the words of that statement when he withdrew from the event. He could not attend any event that was described as a Liberal Party event. He would be unable to give this address, at least while he is in the position of royal commissioner. So he is already flagging, 'Hey, guys; don't forget about me. The moment this one's over, I'll be back there for your fundraiser.' He could not even hold back from making sure that he gets invited to the Liberal Party fundraisers again in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           You would have thought that the former
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Heydon" rel="nofollow">
            Justice Heydon
           </a>
           would have known, given that these are the words of a judgement he himself delivered in the case of British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited v Laurie in 2011, not that long ago. I quote from paragraph 139:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           It is fundamental to the administration of justice that the judge be neutral. It is for this reason that the appearance of departure from neutrality is a ground of disqualification. … it is the perception of the hypothetical observer that provides the yardstick.
          </p>
          <p>
           Be in no doubt: if a juror behaved this way, they would be off the jury immediately. If a juror behaved this way, they would be gone. But somehow this Prime Minister reckons that a royal commissioner can behave this way and that is fine. The reason goes to the very character of this Prime Minister and why he started this royal commission to begin with: because he wanted someone who would be partisan. He wanted someone who would be biased. He wanted someone who would engage in—

              I have got to say, if these are not reasons why we should suspend standing orders, I do not know what are. The problem that we have in front of us is that the only way to be able to pursue this debate is to suspend standing orders, because the Prime Minister will not honestly answer a question. And we know he cannot answer a question honestly because, in the space of half an hour, he gave the opposite answer for the same question.

                When asked, 'Which one do you agree with?' he says, 'Both. Black, white—they're both true.' That is where the Prime Minister got to in question time. But he also said, 'If you want to bring on a debate then let's have it.' So we said, 'Okay; we'll have a debate.' Do they give leave for it? No. And then, when we start to refer to issues in the debate during the suspension, they say, 'You can't do that—oh no. Quick, jump up with a point of order.' Those opposite—their embarrassment is for one reason only: they have been found out, found out by the entire Australian people. There is nowhere to hide for them on this one.
               </p>
               <p>
                A royal commissioner cannot be a guest at a political party fundraiser. A royal commissioner cannot be a guest at a Liberal Party fundraiser. And those opposite know it. But, disturbingly, their party, back in April, thought this was okay. They have known. The Australian people have found out in the last few hours. Those opposite have known since April, and they never thought it was a problem. They have known since April, and they thought it was fine to continue. Those opposite thought: 'If this is what's going on, that's further proof that this commissioner is doing the exact sort of job that he was appointed to.' That is what they are doing. We have the recommendations that we had from the Prime Minister. He said, 'You appoint someone of this man's standing because you trust to his judgement.' Well, I bet you do, but the Australian people have no reason to trust when what they are given is conflict and bias.

If he does not resign and if he is not sacked by the Prime Minister and this royal commission proceeds, its findings will be of no value to the people of Australia because they are already discredited because of this extraordinary error of judgement made by this royal commissioner. This Liberal Party royal commission into trade unions has spent over $80 million of taxpayers' money so far pursuing the political opponents of the Abbott government. Of course corruption is to be deplored, of course allegations of serious misconduct are to be thoroughly investigated and of course anyone involved in illegal behaviour in any workplace, whether unionist or employer, should feel the full weight of the law—and Labor has made clear again and again that we have no tolerance for corruption of any kind. But this royal commission, Mr Abbott's royal commission, should be seen for what it is. I do not know why members opposite are laughing but clearly they do not think this is a serious a matter about which standing orders should be suspended.

The highly politicised nature of this royal commission has been plain for all to see from the first day of hearings. Those of you who were watching it all would recall that the first day of hearings was concerned with former Prime Minister Julia Gillard about events that were said to have occurred more than 20 years ago—and it turned up nothing. But that was the purpose of this royal commission; that was the first smear that this royal commission wanted to land. That is why standing orders should be suspended. This royal commission has also dragged the leader of the federal opposition before it to answer questions. Once again a Labor leader had to answer hundreds and hundreds of questions about matters in the past, and it led nowhere. The misuse of executive power which is represented by this royal commission is unprecedented in this country.

                                          makes a number of points and there have been various statements from Speakers over the years on this subject. It makes two points, as you would well be aware. There is a difference between sub judice with respect to court cases and royal commissions and, frankly, it would be a ridiculous restriction of debate if matters that have been raised in public and reported in the media could not be aired in the national parliament. This has been raised, I think, on three occasions before by the member for Isaacs. I am calling the Leader of the House.

                                           Obviously, the point that is being made is that the reason the suspension of standing orders should not be agreed to is because it is simply a massive smokescreen from the Labor Party's embarrassment about their tawdry relationship with the union movement. I am giving examples from the trade union royal commission about why the Labor Party would be embarrassed. Why would they be embarrassed? They are embarrassed because of revelations like that about Winslow Constructors—
