        Today the parliament hosted the 2009 Simpson Prize presentation ceremony. This is a competition managed by history teachers in Australia on behalf of the government. The theme was Gallipoli and Anzac Day and the meaning of those events. The winner, from

        Christine Hartley is a local resident within Cowan and I know her parents, Stephen and Georgina Hartley, will be very proud of her success. Already in the gifted and talented academic program at Shenton College, she is also in the instrumental music program and she is well rounded, being an accomplished netballer and swimmer. The family left Mount Tom Price to make sure that their children could have better access to education. That faith has been well and truly rewarded by the great success Christine has found. She has also been inspired by teachers Gabby Barrett, Chloe Brittan and
