        As I mentioned last night in the chamber, I attended the Paspaley Star Ball for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_Children's_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Starlight Children's Foundation
        </a>
        on Friday, 20 May. One of the highlights of the evening was the raffle. First prize was a gorgeous string of Paspaley pearls that were kindly donated by local identity, Paspaley Pearl. The winner of these stunning pearls was Belinda Howie, a lovely young lady who is a born and bred Territorian. In my view, these pearls could not have gone to a more deserving home.

        As I have also mentioned in the House before, in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election I strongly campaigned to allow the empty
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        base houses in Darwin to be used by the community and to prevent their destruction or removal. I have continued to work with local group Save Eaton to fight to ensure that these houses are not sitting vacant. Yesterday in the House I presented a private member's motion to hand over the 396 houses to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Housing Australia
        </a>
        , making them available to Territorians. Following that, in the chamber yesterday I presented a petition supporting my motion, which has been through the Petitions Committee and is in order with 719 signatures.
       </p>
       <p>
        It must also be noted that these houses have been offered to both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        government and the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Both have expressed their lack of interest in taking over this land and these houses. To add to this inaction of another Labor government, I was outraged yesterday to learn that more than 205 of these 396 houses are now sitting vacant. This is absolutely outrageous. I therefore urge the Gillard Labor government again to support my motion and make these houses available to Territorians in order help keep the Ludmilla Primary School open, support local business owners and rebuild a vibrant inner city community. It is time to stop the waste and mismanagement of taxpayer funded resources, make these houses available to Territorians and make them available now.
