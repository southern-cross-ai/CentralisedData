         Arnott's Biscuits
        </a>
        began in 1865, when the Scottish immigrant, William Arnott, opened a bakery in Newcastle, providing biscuits to townspeople and the ships docking at the local port. Arnott's now has a number of factories around Australia, with one in my electorate of Hindmarsh as well as one in the electorate of Chifley. I know the member for Chifley, like myself, is proud of the workers and facilities of Arnott's. The Marleston factory in Hindmarsh employs over 300 people.

With many of our manufacturing companies facing challenges, it is important that we support local companies like Arnott's.    One of the specialties of the Marleston facility is liquid chocolate that they send to other sites around Australia. Probably one of the best things about Arnott's is the
