       <p>
        I currently have a social work student, Katherine, on placement in my office. She is an exceptional young woman who embodies all the qualities one would expect in a social worker. Social work is a profession dedicated to the respect of human dignity and worth, to the pursuit of social justice and to providing a competent service to humanity, delivered with integrity. This describes Katherine. The words that I am now going to read are words that have been put together by her—and I obviously agree with them. She says that the situation in Wadeye has been of great concern to her. Having an understanding of the issues that this community faces such as intergenerational poverty, lack of education, poor housing, domestic violence and sexual abuse, Katherine finds it hard to see how law enforcement could be utilised as an effective intervention in response to this crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has expressed concerns that these issues are complex and require long-term commitment. Katherine’s fellow student is currently on placement in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        and experiencing these situations first-hand. Her fellow student has explained to her the complexities of the issue in Wadeye. Katherine’s fellow student told her that there have been 15 murders in Wadeye—14 of these were committed against people from the particular Indigenous population. She feels that this reflects the racism that they experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current media images of the situation in Wadeye, alongside the existing racism, leave Aboriginal men in particular with the stigma of the colour of their skin, of having no education, of being violent and of being sexual abusers. For the victim, it is also about establishing their self-esteem, gaining a sense of control back and knowledge about the cyclic nature of domestic violence. Katherine feels that this brings a large amount of shame to the community, which will only exacerbate the existing issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Katherine commented to me on the current intervention, which consists of extra policing around Wadeye. She says, ‘If you have a cyst, would you go to the doctor and check out what the cause was or would you put a bandaid on it?’ I obviously said I would go to the doctor, and she said, ‘Yes, well, of course.’ To get any change, you need to identify the cause and identify what the body’s strengths are in order to start the treatment. Katherine said that, in relation to Wadeye, enforcing the law is not an intervention that will contribute to the re-establishment of a safe and cohesive community. The values are ingrained and intergenerational.
       </p>
       <p>
        Community development is needed to change the mentality. The people of Wadeye need opportunity, safety and hope in order to create a society in which they can achieve and contribute positively to the wider community. Law enforcement will simply relocate the issue and leave the victims to cope with their trauma, not knowing what the future holds. Community development will instil some pride and hope back into the lives of the people of Wadeye.
