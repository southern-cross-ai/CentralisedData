        A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of hosting the student leaders afternoon tea for new school leaders around the Bonner electorate. Joining me on the day was my good friend Andy Gourley, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Frogs" rel="nofollow">
         Red Frogs
        </a>
        , who is such a positive role model for young people today. The event celebrated the achievements of these exceptional young people and gave them a valuable one-on-one with Andy. Student leaders from Manly West State School, Mount Gravatt East State School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairvaux_College" rel="nofollow">
         Clairvaux College
        </a>
        , along with over 40 students from other local primary and high schools, attended the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was impressed with the insightful questions that they presented to me and to Andy. I have no doubt these young men and women have very bright futures ahead of them. Students were captivated when Andy talked about the way Red Frogs came to be and the amazing work that Red Frogs volunteers do. Andy did a great job in inspiring young students to be the best that they can be in the new leadership roles. As he told them, leadership influences others and passion creates change, so you need to become the change that you want to see in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was wonderful to see such a strong turnout of student leaders in our community and to connect them with such amazing motivators, like Andy. I received great feedback on the event from the schools that got involved and I was glad to hear that the students left feeling empowered to make a difference in their school community.
