        It is fair to say that Beryl Driver is a Mackellar icon. She received the Order of Australia medal, a 2013

        award. I cannot emphasise enough her compassion and dedicate to the community. Beryl is a truly inspiration woman who has given everything she has to those in need, even to her own detriment. In 1985, at the age of 65, Beryl competed in the first Variety Bash, becoming the first woman to do so. In fact, she was first woman to take an all-women crew, a feat which allowed her to purchase a $30,000 vehicle for a mere $3,000. Beryl has participated in the Variety Bash every year since then, driving a decorated 40-year-old car to rural towns so as to deliver health and educational equipment to children in need.

        However, Beryl community's service extends much further than the Variety Bash. She has used her to car deliver equipment and furniture to Southern Cross Wildlife Care, a veterinary hospital in Braidwood. She has also spent much of her time taking crockery, clothing and many other much-needed goods to a mother and child refuge in Brewarrina. Knowing Beryl has taught me a great deal about what it means to be selfless. Too often we put ourselves first; Beryl is an exception to this rule. She perfectly embodies compassion and has inspired her community to do so as well. I wish her the best of luck in her upcoming Variety Bash, especially as she will be dressed as a mermaid.
