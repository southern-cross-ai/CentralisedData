       <p>
        Anzac Day 2015 will be a special moment in our nation's history, as we commemorate the 100 years since diggers stepped foot on the beaches at Gallipoli and as we mark the centenary of our nation's involvement in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        . As we commemorate the Anzac Centenary, we not only remember the original Anzacs who served at Gallipoli and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
         Western Front
        </a>
        ; we commemorate more than a century of service by Australian service men and women.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the government's key elements of the Anzac Centenary commemorations is the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. I established the Hindmarsh Centenary of Anzac Committee to decide which project applications are worthy of funding in my electorate. I would like to thank the executive members of the Hindmarsh Centenary of Anzac Committee: Cliff Kerwin, President of Hilton

        ; and others from the council and the community, who met from time to time. Most importantly, I would like to sincerely thank Mr Peter Summers for his excellent work as chair of the Hindmarsh Centenary of Anzac Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that 11 projects in Hindmarsh were approved and will receive funding. Such projects include the construction of the Plympton Glenelg RSL's new war memorial in Moseley Square next to the Glenelg jetty. As one of the most visited areas in Adelaide, this will provide a terrific place to hold Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        services and serve as a reminder of the service and sacrifice of all those who have worn our nation's uniform, including the more than 102,000 who have made the supreme sacrifice. Another worthy project was the Henley and Grange RSL's history competition for eligible secondary school students. It was a fantastic idea which ensures that school students learn the history of the Anzacs.
       </p>

        Other worthy projects include: the Jewish Community Council of

       <p>
        Another successful applicant was Re-Enact SA, who conducted a uniformed march to commemorate the light horse camp at Morphettville. This was held last year, with a formal ceremony in Glenelg, with great paraphernalia and fanfare as many participated walking down

        </a>
        to Glenelg to celebrate this wonderful event. Also, the Army Health Services Historical Research Group received funding to produce a book called
        <i>

        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        <i>
         Sweat and Fears
        </i>
        , which tells the history of medical practitioners and medical students of South Australia who served in

         World War I
        </a>
        . The book was highly popular, and the authors have done a great job to receive reprint.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all grant recipients and, like many Australians, am looking forward to commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Anzac landings.
