        Before I was rudely interrupted by question time and a so-called MPI, I was informing all of Australia about that great moment in history when politicians, governments and scientists all came together to address the problem of the ozone holes, which are now healing at the rate of one to three per cent a decade, where politicians listened to scientists and responded accordingly. By the 2030s, the hole in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Hemisphere
        </a>
        will have completely vanished, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        hole should disappear by the 2060s. This is incredible news, but it's also frustrating to know that the same world with the same scientists has not been able to unite as effectively over climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm telling this great story today because the success of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol" rel="nofollow">
         Montreal Protocol
        </a>
        holds lessons for today's efforts to confront dangerous climate change. Vigorous leadership by

        </a>
        , a trained chemist, were crucial during the negotiations on the Montreal treaty. The protocol was designed to be flexible so that more ozone-depleting substances could be phased out by later amendments. Developing countries were also provided with incentives and institutional support to meet their compliance targets. I state that again, because there has been a little bit of controversy from those opposite about that idea of helping developing countries when it comes to dealing with a science problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        But perhaps the most important lesson comes from the fact that the globe sees the need for action even when the science was not 100 per cent conclusive.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … we don't need absolute certainty to act. When Montreal was signed, we were less certain then of the risks from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFC" rel="nofollow">
         CFC
        </a>
        s than we are now of the risks from greenhouse gas emissions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The adoption of the Montreal Protocol was a turning point in environmental history. It also showed that, when science and political willpower join forces, the results can change the world today and deliver a better tomorrow for our children. You cannot have a better story of hope than that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has always been at the forefront of efforts to protect the ozone layer. Under the Hawke government, Australia had a strong program to protect the ozone layer and manage synthetic greenhouse gases stemming from the Montreal Protocol. It's an interesting point to note that, through protection of the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol has done more for climate protection than any other measures so far. Our nation's work to heal the ozone layer is also helping us meet the Albanese government's emissions target of 43 per cent by 2030 and to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        This package of legislation before the House is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Program. Ever since the ozone crisis emerged, this has been one of our most important pieces of environmental policy. It regulates the manufacture, import, export, use and disposal of ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. I know that because I've got a sister who's an electrician, and even in country Queensland she has to deal with these gases appropriately when taking out refrigerators and air conditioners. This implements our international obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_Layer" rel="nofollow">
         Ozone Layer
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a strong program to protect the ozone layer and to manage synthetic greenhouse gases, and we need to keep this strong. After years—years!—of delay on climate policy and scientists being attacked by government ministers, and even by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Ministers
        </a>
        , and after experiencing natural disasters in my own electorate and in electorates around Australia, all aggravated by global warming, Australians now, in 2022, want and demand real action. That's why one of the first pieces of legislation the Albanese government brought to this parliament was our legislation to increase Australia's climate ambition.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are the 12th-largest economy in a world of around 200 countries—the 12th largest. We are the 55th-largest country by population. So if not us, who? How can we, as a global leader—the nation that was essential in forming the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        , led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Evatt" rel="nofollow">
         Doc Evatt
        </a>
        , a Labor leader—look poorer and smaller countries in the eye and say, 'You need to do more when it comes to responding to dangerous climate change,' if we don't do our bit? In fact, as a Labor member of parliament, I say we should be world leaders, and I'm from a party of government, not a poseur party that has protests as a political business model. You know those parties that have been around for decades, who harvest clicks and deliver absolutely nothing to their members? That is not the Labor way. That is not the way of a party of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures, which a Labor government has brought to the parliament, are another example of what we can practically do to protect our climate and meet our ambitious emissions reduction targets, and take all of Australia with us. Australia has an established innovative product scheme, which collects used refrigerants and turns their potent greenhouse gases into harmless salty water. As I mentioned, my sister the electrician deals with this process in country Queensland. All tradies understand it. These bills will make Australia's program even stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures will reduce administrative burdens on businesses and make the legislation easier to understand, reducing the opportunities for unintentional non-compliance. It will also introduce measures to modernise and strengthen the enforcement powers. As the saying goes, you govern for all but you also need to have regulations for the few rogues out there that might not be doing the right thing. The ozone protection and synthetic greenhouse gases bills will continue to provide protection for our environment and human health, and play a strong role in Australia's action on climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not often that I stand in the parliament of Australia and thank people like Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" rel="nofollow">
         Mikhail Gorbachev
        </a>
        all at the same time and say their environmental leadership is what helped save the planet. So Thatcher and Reagan, politicians not renowned for their left-wing activities—although it's fair to say Ronald Reagan was a trade union leader; he led the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" rel="nofollow">
         Screen Actors Guild
        </a>
        for a while—stepped up, listened to the scientists before the science was settled and responded appropriately. So we do know that with the right leadership, with the right politicians, the world can do the right thing and Australia, as a significant player on the world stage, needs to do its bit. And in light of our leading role in the Pacific, we especially need to show our Pacific neighbours that we are a proud part of Oceania, that we will do what is right by our neighbours to make sure that a wealthy country like Australia is doing the right thing when it comes to ozone, when responding to dangerous climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ozone protection and synthetic greenhouse gas bills of 2022 are not spectacular pieces of legislation on one level, but they show what scientists and politicians can do when they work in concert. I commend the legislation to the House.
