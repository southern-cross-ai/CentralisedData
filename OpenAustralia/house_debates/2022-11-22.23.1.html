       <p>
        Labor has confirmed it is scrapping funding for the Agricultural Shows Development Grants Program. In estimates week, agricultural minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Watt" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Watt
        </a>
        said $14 million in agricultural funding for shows was being reprioritised. Estimates has sadly proved Labor is taking even more money out of regional and rural Australia, with infrastructure funding for ag shows now gone, including in my electorate of Flynn. We already know Labor has taken billions away from regions, scrapping water and major infrastructure commitments, but now they are cruelly taking away the Agricultural Shows Development Grants Program funding. This money was to improve infrastructure for ag shows in Flynn. It is another kick in the guts for Flynn show societies, of which many are already struggling. The funding was on top of $20 million previously provided for 120 shows to build new pavilions and exhibition areas; install seating, shade and weather protection; upgrade accessibility; improve public safety and animal welfare; and upgrade power and energy efficiency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ag shows generate a huge $1 billion annually in economic benefits, promoting new technologies and high-quality produce. For some communities and charities, agricultural shows give the financial boost they need to get them through the year. Labor needs to explain why it doesn't prioritise regional and rural Australia. It has abandoned our regional communities and taken away much-needed infrastructure.
