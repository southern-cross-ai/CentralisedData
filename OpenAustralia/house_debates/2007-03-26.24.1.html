        I also rise to table a petition today. The petition was presented to me and to the shadow minister for the environment, the member for

        , by my state member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hunter" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        . The petition is signed by over 1,500 concerned local residents who oppose the establishment of nuclear power plants in either Lake Macquarie or the Hunter region. The petition was presented to me and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Garrett" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Garrett
        </a>
        a couple of weeks ago. The strong support for the petition highlights the depth of the local residents’ opposition to the advent of nuclear power plants in our area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is proposing to build 25 nuclear power stations by 2050 on the doorsteps of the nation’s major towns and cities. The message that is being sent to the federal government is that we do not support nuclear power plants in the Lake Macquarie area. The government has made it clear that it is going to build these nuclear power plants on the edges of our urban areas, and the message from the people of Lake Macquarie and my constituents in Charlton is that we do not want them there. The traditional coal-fired power stations around Lake Macquarie have served the energy needs of our area well. We will continue to invest in clean coal and in research to ensure that this remains a viable industry in our area. I seek leave to table the petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We the undersigned petitioners request the Federal Government exclude Lake Macquarie and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Region
        </a>
        as potential nuclear power station sites as these would be high risk generators with disastrous consequences should an accident occur.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore pray that the House opposes the proposal to build 25 nuclear power plants in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        from over 1500 citizens.
