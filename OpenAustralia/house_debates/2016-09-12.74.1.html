        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. The people of Indi were made a series of funding commitments by the government during the campaign. On 23 June, $10 million was announced for the

         Kiewa Valley Highway

        and the Rutherglen bypass and, on 3 June, $7.1 million for roads in Walwa and the

         Hume Highway
        </a>

         I thank the member for Indi for her question. I appreciate her interest in the coalition's plan for jobs and growth and prosperity. For the information of new members, I can inform the House that the member for Indi is a purveyor of find tokay and Christmas cake, and I hope I get my invitation to the soiree later on this year.

         </a>
         also say that she also takes a very keen interest in coalition policy and the development of those policies. She was particularly interested in my frequent visits to her electorate during the election campaign. Admittedly, I was not always there in a supporting role, but, as the member for the neighbouring electorate, it is true that Albo had to build the

         to keep us apart.

        <p>
         I assure the member for Indi that all commitments that were made during the election campaign will be honoured and I know that she has a particular interest in our commitments to infrastructure and transport. We have had conversations about that. These commitments will be kept and they will be honoured, because we are government that does keep its promises. This is a Prime Minister who has committed to getting on with the job of delivering right across Australia—not just in our cities but also in our regional centres. The only way that any of these projects are to be delivered in the seat of Indi is for this side of the House to get on with the job of delivering, because those on the other side actually promised nothing for Indi—no mobile phone blackspots program, no constructive programs to help towns like Wangaratta, Wodonga, Bright and Rutherglen, nothing to help your community prosper in the future. It is this side of the chamber that is actually working with the member for Indi to deliver the projects that she is so interested in. The Turnbull-Joyce government has a $50 billion infrastructure investment program. As I said, it is not just in our cities; it is also in our regional centres. It is through our Roads to Recovery program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program, the Black Spots program and, in particular, the issues that the member for Indi raised regarding the specific questions of—

For the information of members in this place, probably the most constructive thing they can do is to get on the phone to Premier

Changing lives through reducing congestion, improving productivity and also saving lives through the investment in the engineering treatments which will improve safety on our road network.
