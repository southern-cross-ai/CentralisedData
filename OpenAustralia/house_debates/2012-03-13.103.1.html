        Last week I launched Epilepsy Awareness Month in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay
        </a>
        region with the event Cupcakes in the Park. This was a fantastic community event that brought attention to the important issue of epilepsy awareness. It is a condition that has wide-reaching implications in my community and for people all around our nation. Epilepsy is the world's most common brain disorder and impacts around one in 50 Australians during their lifetime. For such a common disorder little is known about it. The frustration that sufferers of epilepsy face is that there is no single cause and there is no known cure. About 70 per cent of epilepsy sufferers are able to successfully control their seizures with medication. However, others are faced with the fear of not being able to control their seizures and not knowing when the next one will strike. Unfortunately, this can lead to physical, psychological and social issues, and has the potential to impact on the sufferer's access to education, employment and involvement in relationships.

        I have personally seen the impact that this invasive condition can have on a person's life, having grown up with one of my best mates suffering from epilepsy. Not only are there many questions left to be answered about epilepsy by the medical world; epilepsy continues to be overwhelmingly misunderstood by the general population. It is for this reason that I decided to raise awareness and break down the stigmas surrounding epilepsy by hosting Cupcakes in the Park. I want to thank the many locals who came out in support of Cupcakes in the Parkâ€”locals who are keen to meet and support others in the community who have suffered at the effects of epilepsy, whether it was themselves, their friends, their family or their colleagues. As I have always found with my community, locals are keen to get behind those in need and offer their support. This event was no exception. Those that attended were keen to learn more about epilepsy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Epilepsy Queensland for their assistance with this event and also for the good work they are doing in Queensland. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        of Epilepsy Queensland, Helen Whitehead, attended and shared her experience and vision for Epilepsy Queensland. I would also like to thank one of my staff members, Shannon Murray, who, as a sufferer of epilepsy, has opened my eyes to the challenges faced by sufferers across the country. Without her help, this local event would not have been possible. Thank you, Shannon.

        Purple Day is on 26 March. It is the international day dedicated to increasing awareness of epilepsy. Cupcakes in the park was my community's Purple Day event. Purple Day was started in 2008 by Megan Cassidy, a nine-year-old Canadian girl who wanted sufferers of epilepsy to know that they did not have to face their condition alone. Getting to support one another is what Purple Day is all about. I was proud to hold this community event and I thank my community for their support.
