        I rise to congratulate Inspector Corey Allen of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Police Service
        </a>
        on the instrumental role he has played in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Start" rel="nofollow">
         Smart Start
        </a>
        project which yesterday received the silver award in the community category at the 2016 Australian Crime and Violence Prevention Awards. The Australian Crime and Violence Prevention Awards recognise good practice in the prevention and reduction of violence and other types of crime in Australia. I know that all members would agree that reducing crime in Australia is paramount.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Smart Start project, a joint initiative of the Queensland Police Service and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        , began in June 2014. It is one of the first research projects of its kind to include research engagement with frontline police and a focus on operational outcomes. The project has enabled frontline police to better engage with and educate the community on a serious topic, alcohol related violence. I understand that many of the frontline police involved in the project have appreciated the opportunity to engage with the community in such positive terms. Congratulations must also be extended to the Griffith University team, who are also heavily invested in reducing alcohol related violence and antisocial behaviour.
       </p>

        Let me turn my focus to Corey. As a truly remarkable local, Corey has enriched through his hard work not just the community of Ryan but also that of the city of Brisbane. I first met Corey when he served with Queensland police as officer in charge at the Indooroopilly station in Ryan. As a police officer Corey has attended his share of incidents, some that I am sure leave a severe mark. However, continuing to serve his community, Corey still believes that the most effective policing occurs by being out and about and working in the community, not sitting behind a desk. It is the efforts of people like Corey, who has personally worked tirelessly to improve the lives of thousands of Brisbane residents, that embody what it means to be an Australian. Corey's own unique style of policing is underpinned by a vision to create connections in the community and build tolerance and trust where none previously existed. Corey has worked relentlessly, with no expectation of community gratitude, and is focused on the issues of youth, homelessness and public safety, introducing several innovative programs to tackle these issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        With old-fashioned policing values, where the officer in charge knows the people in their area and works with them on a first-name basis, it is no wonder that Corey continues to achieve at high levels. I would like again to congratulate Corey for his dedication to our community and sincerely thank all those members of the Queensland Police Service and all serving police across Australia who provide a safe environment for our community.
