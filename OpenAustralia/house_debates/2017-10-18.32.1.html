        Last Friday night I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        Chamber of Commerce annual Gala Awards Night, at which winners of the 2017 Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce Outstanding Business Awards were announced. The Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce strives to improve business within Mount Gambier. It's a fantastic organisation. It holds breakfasts and networking events across the year. Mount Gambier has some of the most amazing entrepreneurial talent, which was made clear on Friday night, when the very best and brightest were on show. A big shout-out to the president and vice-president of the chamber, Lyn Martin and Ben Hood, for their organisation of the event.

        But the real stars of the night were of course the award winners, and in the time I've got left I'd like to mention them. Employee of the Year is Mick O'Donohoe of Avis Car Rental. Not only is he a great employee but he's the father of seven and a foster carer for four—an amazing man. Young Business Person of the Year is Georgia Quick. The environment and sustainability award went to the environmental team at

        </a>
        . The new business award went to Key 2 Sale. The building and manufacturing award went to Adam Fosdike at Mates Rates Mount Gambier. The tourism, hospitality and accommodation award went to the Old Mount Gambier Gaol—to Jamie and Mel Stephenson at that facility. Mark and Casey Allen at Sonic Vision got the business service award, and the agribusiness award went to the Splendid Egg group. The small business award went to Morris Dickins of Dickins' Delights. Grow Systems Australia took out the innovation award, and the retail business award went to Mel Von Stanke and the team at Vanity hair and make-up.
