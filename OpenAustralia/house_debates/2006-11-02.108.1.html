        I rise to acknowledge the passing of a great Australian athlete and a great humanitarian. I speak of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norman" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Norman
        </a>
        , who died suddenly last month at the age of 64. I had the privilege of knowing Peter. Our families went camping together one year.
       </p>
       <p>
        At his death he still held the Australian 200 metres record, set at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City" rel="nofollow">
         Mexico City
        </a>
        Olympics in 1968. That record still stands—20.06 seconds—an amazing achievement almost 40 years later. That time would have won him a gold medal at every Olympics until 1984. Peter won five straight 200 metres national titles from 1966 to 1970. He was in the bronze medal winning team for the four by 110 yards relay at the 1966
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In Mexico City, in setting that unbeaten record, he ran second to

        came third. Both were black American athletes. What happened next became a defining moment in Olympic history and the history of the

        civil rights movement: Smith and Carlos stood shoeless, heads bowed, with clenched fists raised in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Power" rel="nofollow">
         Black Power
        </a>
        salute in protest at racial discrimination in the United States—all this whilst the American national anthem was played. Peter Norman stood with them, wearing a civil rights badge. He had earlier suggested to Smith and Carlos that each wear one glove after Carlos forgot to bring his gloves to the podium. It was a powerful and indelible image, flashed around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The actions of Smith and Carlos stirred enormous controversy in the United States. They were sent home the following day. Norman, while not sent home, was heavily criticised on his return, but he remained steadfast in his belief that what he did was right.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter was a humble man. He was raised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        and his parents taught him to take care of people who could not take care of themselves. He believed in civil rights. ‘Every man is born equal and should be treated that way,’ he said. And, when put to the test, he rose to the occasion magnificently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates has described Peter as a superb athlete and a man to whom social justice was important. After his retirement Peter continued to contribute to athletics and a range of sports, helping with Olympic fundraising and Olympic education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout his life, and in that glorious moment in Mexico City, Peter Norman embodied true moral courage and generosity of spirit. Recently in Australia we have been having a debate about Australian values and what it means to be Australian. Peter Norman embodied what is good about Australia and Australians: good humour, respect, tolerance, humility, honesty, moral principle and great courage. We salute him for his great sporting achievements and his values.
       </p>
       <p>
        He remained good friends with Tommie Smith and John Carlos until his death. They were pallbearers at his funeral. At his funeral John Carlos said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Peter put his life out there for us all those years ago and carried it to his death. He never flinched.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter is survived by his second wife Jan and their daughters Belinda and Emma, and by his first wife Ruth and their children Gary, Sandra and Janita. To them I send my condolences.
