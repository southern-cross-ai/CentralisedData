        On Friday, 5 June, my wife and I were very privileged to be invited to the Macquarie Anglican Grammar School commissioning service for their new headmaster Mr Craig Mansour. Mr Mansour has moved to Dubbo from Nowra, where he was the head of campus at Shoalhaven Region Anglican Schools. I would like to compliment the Macquarie Anglican Grammar School because in the very short 14 years since it has been established, it has become a centre of excellence for education in the Dubbo community. Along with the other schools in Dubbo, whether they be the Dubbo Christian School, St John's Catholic Primary School or the large number of public primary and high schools, Dubbo has become a centre of excellence for education, together with the outlying schools in the Parkes electorate.

        This week I had the privilege of meeting the students from Rowena Public School, a very small school in western

        . They were certainly great ambassadors for the black soil plains of western New South Wales. Also, on Monday students of the Boggabri Public School were privileged to be part of the ceremony to celebrate 800 years of the

        . They did the community of Boggabri very proud in the way that they were presented and the way that they behaved while they were here.
