        Since this parliament last met, there have been a number of significant anniversaries on which Australia has paused to remember our fallen men. I would like to speak about a number of anniversaries tonight. As members are aware, this year marks 100 years since the

        in the Vietnam War. This year we can reflect on the sacrifices made and acknowledge the brave men who risked their lives and made the ultimate sacrifice in these historical battles.
       </p>
       <p>
        19 July marked 100 years since the Battle of Fromelles, the first major engagement by Australian troops on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
         Western Front
        </a>
        . At 6pm on 19 July 2016 the 5th Australian and 61st British divisions attacked. The attack began to go wrong almost immediately. Australian troops packed into the trenches suffered casualties from German artillery fire. Sergeant Jimmy Downing, of the 57th Battalion, stated: 'Hundreds were mown down in the flicker of an eyelid, like great rows of teeth knocked from a comb ... men were cut in two by streams of bullets ... it was all over in five minutes.'
       </p>
       <p>
        As dawn approached, the Australians were forced to fall back. The 5th division suffered 5,533 casualties, of which 1,917 were killed and 3,146 wounded. In addition, 470 Australians were taken prisoner. For these brave men, this must have been the longest night of their lives. Under constant attack, and with their fellow soldiers wounded or killed right in front of them, they pushed on, trying to gain important ground and protect their mates. The courage of these men, the sheer bravery of their actions, cannot be understated. But it did not end there. For three days and nights, these brave soldiers risked their lives, under open fire, in an attempt to retrieve the hundreds of wounded men in no man's land. It was at this time that they displayed the Anzac spirit that was forged at Gallipoli.
       </p>
       <p>
        And it was while our soldiers were still trying to retrieve their fellow men from no man's land in Fromelles that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pozieres" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Pozieres
        </a>
        began. Lasting seven weeks, the Battle of Pozieres saw 23,000 causalities, including 6,800 deaths, almost equalling the amount of casualties experienced in the eight months at Gallipoli. World War 1 historian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bean" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Bean
        </a>
        called the area around Pozieres 'more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other place on earth'. The battles of Fromelles and Pozieres demonstrate the bravery and resilience of Australians on the front line. Ongoing efforts to commemorate them are an important sign of the legacy they have left for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, this year marks 50 years since the Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War. Last month we remembered the sacrifices made in this battle, which was one of the most significant engagements in the Vietnam War for Australian forces. It involved 105 Australians and three

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong" rel="nofollow">

        soldiers. The Australians fought for their lives in tough conditions in this battle. It was pouring with rain and they faced rough terrain, with mud, trees and mist being their only cover. Despite the Australians being triumphant at Long Tan, there were losses on both sides. During the battle, 18 Australians were killed and 24 Australians were wounded. On the Vietnamese side, at least 245 were killed and an estimated 350 wounded.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         The Vietnam War
        </a>
        was marred by great loss and tragedy, and it is important that we remember the more than 60,000 who served in that war under Australia's name. It is also important that we recognise their families and pay tribute to them as well. In our history, Vietnam veterans were not always afforded the respect that they deserve. However, I am pleased to see that Australia does now come together to recognise that these men served the country with dignity and respect and many payed the ultimate sacrifice.
       </p>
       <p>
        All veterans who have served and who serve today deserve our greatest respect and admiration for their service to our nation. Lest we forget.
