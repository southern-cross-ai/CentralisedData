        The international Tamil conference and seminar, held last weekend, was the first of its kind to be hosted in Australia for the Tamil people. There are many thousands from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" rel="nofollow">
         Tamil Nadu
        </a>
        state in southern India now living in Australia. Like many other migrant communities, they make a great contribution to our country. In fact, the Adelaide Tamil Association banner states 'Working for the community'. Hindmarsh is home to many wonderful Indian restaurants and businesses, including a number from the Tamil community such as the Charminar grocery store at Plympton. The Adelaide Tamil Association is a non-profit cultural organisation serving the Adelaide Tamil community and will strive to maintain Tamil culture, education and community activities. I want to thank the president, Mr Lawrence Annadurai, the secretary, Mr Norton Antony, and the many other members of the association whom I met for their warm hospitality.

        It was great that the government of Tamil Nadu and the world Tamil association chose Torrensville Primary School in my electorate to facilitate the event. The two-day seminar and workshop covered teaching, education and development of the Tamil language and culture for communities outside India. The event follows the highly successful visit of the Tamil Nadu government to Adelaide in February this year. It was great to talk to Dr Pasumpon, the chairperson for world Tamil association, along with educators and scholars. Prior to welcoming guests, I had the opportunity to witness young children learning the Tamil language. They love their Sunday school lessons for two hours. I look forward to further engagement, including visiting Kumar's restaurant, the Banana Leaf, in Currie Street.
