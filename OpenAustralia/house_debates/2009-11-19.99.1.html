       <p>
        Last Friday, 13 November, I held a breast cancer forum at the Belmont 16 Footers Club. I would like to put on the record my thanks to the Belmont 16 Footers Club for providing the facilities and tea and coffee free of charge. I would also like to put on record my thanks to Kylie Warnock-Rowley from the Cancer Council, who was one of the speakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the remainder of my contribution to this debate I would like to concentrate on Professor John Forbes, who was the keynote speaker at the Breast Cancer Forum. Professor Forbes is one of the most outstanding medical researchers and doctors in the field of breast cancer. He is a person who has made an enormous contribution. He was responsible for setting up the Australia-New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to refer to a speech that was made in this House on Monday night by the member for Hume, Alby Shultz. The member for Hume in his speech highlighted the enormous contributions that have been made by Professor Forbes. He has been involved in national programs with more than 40 institutions. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZ" rel="nofollow">
         ANZ
        </a>
        BCTG is held in the highest regard throughout the world. Professor Forbes is a person who not only excels in the area of research and the care of women who suffer from cancer but is also a person that has the ability to transfer his knowledge to other people. He is an outstanding speaker, he is a person of great compassion, a person who really cares and a person who has made such significant contributions in the area of breast cancer that it is amazing that he has not received recognition for this.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2005 there was a nomination, which the member for Hume was involved in, for Professor Forbes to receive an Order of Australia honour. This was refused. I cannot understand why, because he has been recognised as one of the top clinical researchers in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Scientific" rel="nofollow">
         Thomson Scientific
        </a>
        ‘Hottest Researcher’ list. There is a new nomination going forward. I take great pleasure in supporting that nomination. Professor Forbes is an outstanding researcher and professional in Australia.
