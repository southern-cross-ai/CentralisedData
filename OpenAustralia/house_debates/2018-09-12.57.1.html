        Last week saw schools from across the state converge on Sydney to take part in the annual school boccia championships.

        and Casino High School both made it into the final 16 from nearly 90 schools that entered the knockout competition. After a hard-fought grand final match, Woolgoolga High School came out victorious, winning the gold medal. The winning team consisted of captain Riley Saban, Billy Sutherland, Ciarnah Robertson and Matilda Mariringer. The team was managed by Kayla McIntosh and

        From when he was 12 years old, Tony Darragh knew he wanted to be a barber, and at 16 years of age he began his apprenticeship at Bill and Audrey Stephen Hairdressers in Lismore. Now, 50 years down the track, Tony celebrated five decades in the industry last month and is still cutting and trimming hair and offering shaves to his clients. For the past 35 years, Tony has been established in his own shop in the Lismore CBD, Tony Darragh Hair Cutting For Men. Customers even get to sit in a 1930's barber's chair. For Tony, cutting hair is very therapeutic, and his regulars will be happy to know he has no plans to retire, believing he will still be cutting hair in 10 years time. Tony, married to Loretta, is a stalwart in the community. Congratulations on 50 years of barbering, Tony.

        Kwong Sing's is celebrating 90 years of trading in general retail in Casino next year. It has sold everything from hosiery, crockery, glassware, groceries to footwear and just about everything in between. Frank Fatt worked in the

        store for over 27 years before he and his wife and their children moved to Casino to open his own Kwong Sing's in early 1929. As the store prepared to celebrate its first Christmas in Casino, the local paper wrote that, despite its short time in the town, Kwong Sing's had become a prominent store. Today, Frank's grandson Hilton owns and runs the business, which is still located in Barker Street, and now sells lingerie, clothing and shoes. Hilton's partner, Marie, and his daughters, Eliza and Sabina, have also been involved. Hilton's brother is also the famous purple member of
