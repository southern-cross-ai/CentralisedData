        I rise to acknowledge the new student leaders within the schools of Fadden. Australia’s young leaders play an important role in setting a good example by acting responsibly and indeed making positive choices. What is encouraging is that these leaders have been selected by their schools and, in many instances, by their own peers for their potential to make a positive and lasting contribution to their school communities. We all know that Australia needs great leaders and much more will be demanded of these leaders in their schools today and in their communities tomorrow.

        On another matter, the Queensland state election will be decided this Saturday.

        has pledged $60 million for a new stadium at Carrara, as though the answer to all questions is a new stadium. Yet we know there are 35,000 people languishing on hospital waiting lists and that there are 156,000 people waiting to get on hospital waiting lists in Queensland. You could fill this proposed new stadium 7½ times with the people on Queensland’s hospital waiting lists. I am from the

        17 team has a place to play and a great stadium to call home. The Springborg government will do everything it can, once it gets the books, to find the money to pay for it. But there are 35,000 people on hospital waiting lists and 156,000 people waiting to get on the waiting lists. We could fill a stadium 7½ times with people who desperately need care. When it comes to priorities, I think the answer is people’s health—the health of women, children, old people and young people. That must come before football.
