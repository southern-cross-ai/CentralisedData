       <p>
        s COKER () (): Mobile connectivity in my electorate of Corangamite can be frustrating and inconsistent, but after listening to my community in public forums and advocating to the telcos, we have achieved success. Optus has just announced it will bring forward construction of a telecommunications tower to better support the people of

        and

        . I know that for many a lack of connectivity affects their jobs and their access to education and health, and for some it can be the difference between life and death. At our forums I've heard such stories. When an elderly woman's husband collapsed she tried to ring the ambulance, but there was no signal. She ran outside and finally got through. The ambos wanted her to monitor her husband, but she couldn't, because he was inside on the floor and she was outside in the only place where she could get reception.

        So reliable, fast mobile services matter. Today I will meet with Optus to acknowledge their commitment. I will also be urging Optus to work with the Geelong council to ensure widespread and effective consultation on the tower's location, and I will continue to advocate for residents right across my electorate. We will soon begin federal funding for the communications tower near

        to 30,000 disadvantaged school students. I encourage my students to get on board so that they can get connectivity.
