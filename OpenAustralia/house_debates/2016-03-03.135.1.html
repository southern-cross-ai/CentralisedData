        I am often talking up the need for this government to support water infrastructure in Capricornia. In the southern part of my electorate I have been pushing for Commonwealth and state funding for the raising of Rookwood and Eden Bann weirs. That would create 2,100 jobs near Rockhampton. Over the past two years I have also been advocating for water infrastructure to benefit the northern area of Capricornia—namely, the need to construct Urannah dam near Mackay. Recently I toured the potential Urannah dam site with my colleague the member for Dawson to gain a firsthand insight into the views of local industry in the area. I was delighted to meet a range of people who are also advocating for Urannah dam, including Joanne Freegard,

        ,

        , Fiona Matheson from Eungella Reality, and landholder Troy McEvoy.

       <p>
        Urannah dam would not only provide new opportunities to the Burdekin region but also potentially provide economic stimulus for an area stretching from Eungella—in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —to Collinsville. Wayne Smith and Jo Freegard run Smith's Sawmill in Eungella and told me of the advantages to the local timber industry if Urannah were to proceed. They say the dam site offers an abundance of timber that could be cleared prior to the dam basin being flooded, which would create a stockpile of timber to process at the Eungella sawmill. In short, more timber means a busier mill, which means more local jobs. Local farmers were telling me that a new dam would spell greater grazing opportunities for the beef industry, leading to a further growth in local jobs and rural supplies. If the dam proceeds they are hopeful an old local abattoir might even reopen.

        I am backing Urannah for partial Commonwealth funding. It would provide important jobs and the opportunity to open up new areas of unexplored agriculture. According to regional economic group Bowen Collinsville Enterprise, Urannah dam would spell a boon for the struggling coal town of Collinsville. It could be used for organic horticulture and organic sugar production, as well as coalmining in the

        </a>
        , and to supply electricity to Collinsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my trip to the Eungella area I was also delighted to meet small business owners in the district, including Michaela Pritchard from Eungella General Store, Tess Ford from Eungella Chalet, Fiona Matheson from Eungella Realty and Ian 'Stringy' Smith. The whole day was a great success. I encourage people to go and visit this great tourist destination.
