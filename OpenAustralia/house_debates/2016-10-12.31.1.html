        Today I rise to speak about a stalwart of the Wynnum community that sadly has shut its doors after 60 years of service. It is with great sadness I announce that Bayside Electrical Services is no longer. I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on the difference this small business on Tingal Road has made in the community over the last 60 years, thanks to its owner Brian Turpin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brian first opened Bayside Electrical back in 1957 when he was just 21 years old. He speaks with pride about the rundown 1938 Bedford he bought for 350 pounds back in the day and how he restored to use for his business.
       </p>
       <p>
        From there, Bayside Electrical became a fixture of the Wynnum area, known and loved by all. Brian did not just provide outstanding products and service; he also donated generously to local community groups. He made a difference to so many and asked for no recognition in return.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was touched to receive a call from Brian's granddaughter Kayleene last week inviting me to come down to shake Brian's hand at the very last close of business. I could see how much the shop had meant to him, and I could see how much it had meant to the people of Wynnum. Congratulations to Brian on a well-deserved retirement. Your generosity has been an inspiration. I wish you all the best in the future.
       </p>
