       <p>
        We've heard Labor throughout this week boast about its tax cuts, but, as usual, this is pure spin, with the reality far from anything resembling the alleviation of hardship. Just one more interest rate rise will wipe out more than half of the 1 July tax cuts for the average homeowner, and we know that most economists now expect the next movement in interest rates to be up.

        , which is promising, as we enter the new financial year, that life's going to be easier. But that's the very same promise they made when they were first elected over two years ago, and hardworking Australian families and small businesses know from bitter experience that this is a false claim because they know from what's happening in their own lives that, after two years of this incompetent Labor government, food is up 11.4 per cent, housing is up 14 per cent, rents are up 14.2 per cent and electricity is up 21.5 per cent. That's what happens when you have a big-spending Labor government with no economic plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians know that what they need is a government with a track record of strong economic management. That doesn't mean quotes from Greek philosophers. It means a strong plan that only the coalition can deliver.

         July is a very big month for national days of countries I feel strongly about: 1 July, Canada; tomorrow, 4 July,

         ; and 14 July, France. But, this year, 1 July was a big day for Australians—not quite

         , but even the scrooges opposite that have been lining up to speak must be looking forward to going home and telling their constituents, over the next five weeks, about those tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer. Thirteen point six million Australians will get a tax cut from 1 July. The average worker will be $1,500 better off. And for the nontaxpayers—there could be a few of them—every household will get that $300 energy bill relief. One million small businesses—I think you remember small businesses?—will get $325. Two point six million low-paid workers are getting their third consecutive pay rise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surely, these scrooges opposite want to tell people about this or about the 880,000 jobs created since Labor came to government, the cheaper medicines, the stronger Medicare, the bulk billing incentives, the two weeks extra paid parental leave, the cheaper child care, the student debt being wiped off, the fee-free

         or the over 400,000 Australians who've been investing in themselves. I know you don't have time for a lot of things, but take my speech and send it to your constituents. It covers all of the topics. It will save you a lot of time.
