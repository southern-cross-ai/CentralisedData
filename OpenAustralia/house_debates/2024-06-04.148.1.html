        Club on 29 June. Hosted by the Cancer Council, it's an opportunity for all kinds of members of my community in Casino to put their talent to the test and be judged in a dance competition which will raise funds for the Cancer Council. The donations are used for world-class Cancer Council research, prevention programs, advocacy and support services.

The dancers have a goal of raising $3,000 in donations and have the chance to win three awards: the people's choice, the highest fundraiser and the judges' choice. The dance teachers this year are Sophie Gray, Arabella Barrett,

        Georgia and Grace have played alongside each other for the past two seasons on the Queensland Fire team, as well as the national one-day final against Tasmania last summer.
