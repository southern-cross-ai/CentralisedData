        I rise today to speak about a true Australian hero,

        Teddy Sheean is an Australian hero, and the journey to get his well-deserved

        is a true story of service and sacrifice. On 1 December 1942

        <i>

        was attacked and sunk by Japanese forces. As the ship was going down a wounded Teddy strapped himself to his anti-aircraft gun and maintained fire. He was seen still firing his gun as HMAS
        <i>

        went under. In doing so he sacrificed his own life and saved many of his fellow crew members. Teddy laid down his life in the service of his country but also of his friends, and he was just 18 years old. Finally after much lobbying—78 years, in fact—he has been posthumously recognised and awarded the Victoria Cross. Teddy is the first member of the

        to be awarded the Victoria Cross.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the unveiling I also had the great honour to meet Teddy Sheean's nephew Mick Shea, who very kindly gave me a copy of Teddy's Victoria Cross citation. I now have that citation displayed very proudly in the front foyer of my office, and I encourage locals to come in and have a look. I also encourage locals to visit the Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum to visit this fantastic tribute.
