         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year, it was wonderful to be able to share in the celebrations with my local community at the Maroondah City Council Australia Day awards and ceremony and, at the same time, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehorse_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Whitehorse City Council
        </a>
        , who held their Australia Day citizenship ceremony and civic awards. Today I want to recognise some of those locals who work so hard to make our community what it is and who were recognised on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Maroondah, the Citizen of the Year was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Gordon" rel="nofollow">
         Catherine Gordon
        </a>
        . Catherine was recognised for her pivotal work in promoting inclusiveness and community engagement, predominantly through her work with the Maroondah Volleyball Association. Catherine is a very deserving winner. She's a great personal friend and someone who's worked so hard for the community. The Young Citizen of the Year in Maroondah was Satria Arbai. Satria was recognised for advocating for disability rights and inclusivity, predominantly at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwood_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Ringwood Secondary College
        </a>
        , through the Ringwood Activists for Disability group. He was a very popular winner on the day. The Community Event of the Year this year was awarded to the Language of Friendship, which was accepted by two good friends of mine, Edwina Ricci and Jodie Murphy. They sold out a workshop with 700 bookings presented in partnership with other local groups that they're involved with—URSTRONG, the Maroondah Positive Education Network and the Communities of Wellbeing. The event showed how to support children to create healthy, feel-good social connections. Congratulations to them.

        The Whitehorse Civic Awards recognised a number of really dedicated individuals. The Young Citizens of the Year, Emily Padman, Sebastian van Ketwich and Jacob Niven, were awarded for their wonderful work seeking to reduce soft plastics in their school. Elizabeth Meredith was awarded the Community Achievement Award for her work predominately with the Gardiners Creek Parklands. A local Deakin resident, Heather Tasker, who dedicated her time to various organisations over 50 years from the Lions to the scouts, including the first Vermont scouts, was a really deserving person to be recognised. Helen Gunther is someone I know very well from the Nunawading Toy Library as well as roles in local district guides—congratulations to Helen. The Box Hill Hospital staff, represented by Christine Lamotte, received acknowledgement for their outstanding work during COVID-19. All these people work so hard to make the Maroondah and Whitehorse communities what they are, and it was wonderful that they were recognised on a very special Australia Day this year.
