       <p>
        I rise today to give recognition to a local primary school within my electorate of Kingston in the southern suburbs of Adelaide—the Hackham East Primary School. I acknowledge the students from reception through to year 7, their principal, Mr Bob Thiele, and staff, parents and volunteers. The primary school, and in particular a year 7 student, Dirk Kincaid, sent me an invitation to attend a school performance called Snakes and Ladders. Let me share it with the House so that it can be recorded in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        for all Australians to read.
       </p>
       <p>
        I subsequently responded to the invitation and attended the Hackham East Primary School Snakes and Ladders performance at the Noarlunga
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        theatre. This performance involved drama, music and dance. But what was tremendous was that it involved all age groups within the school, from reception through to year 7. I believe this performance from start to finish was one of the very best I have ever seen. The theme involved the mixing of younger students with older students. The excellent drama, music and dance performances they all gave in their respective costumes were simply a credit to them and their school. I mentioned the theme of the performance. It featured a journey into fantasy lands along a snakes and ladders board. The message was clear for the key young actress on her journey as well as the other performers from reception through to year 7 and other students, parents and anybody else lucky enough to see this performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Thiele should be acknowledged for his tremendous leadership with respect to this performance and the message it provided. I found that Mr Thiele actually has a significant talent in this area. He not only wrote the entire format of the play but also arranged and organised background settings and drafted the songs and dance steps. Furthermore, on every occasion that the school gave its performance to the community, he produced and directed the students in this magnificent display—a job very well done.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to make mention of the tremendous array of costumes worn by the students, which again was a feature. I understand a mum of a former student, current cleaner and volunteer at the school, June Liston, designed and made all of the costumes. This again was a magnificent feat and June was assisted by another parent, volunteer Michelle Glazbrook. There was, as always, a team of staff and parent volunteers who worked behind the scenes, and I would like to congratulate them for the part they played in assisting the students to provide this performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I applaud the Hackham East Primary School Snakes and Ladders reception to year 7 drama, music and dance performance. The role that Principal Bob Thiele played, the assistance by key volunteers, staff and parents and, most importantly, the message and tremendous performance by the students were of the highest standard and should be acknowledged, as I have in parliament in my position as their federal member.
