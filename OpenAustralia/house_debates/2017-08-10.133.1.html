        Over the last several weeks, I have spent a great deal of time out in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        to listen to local people about what is important to them. I was in Spencer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooney_Mooney" rel="nofollow">
         Mooney Mooney
        </a>
        and Kariong for a number of community forums so that we could discuss the issues that matter to the local residents of each of these communities. We also held morning teas in Terrigal and Saratoga. I also wrote to tens of thousands of residents across my electorate, putting the call out and asking what is important to them. We asked what their No. 1 issue was in the community and what they would like to see changed. From that survey, I am pleased to see that more than 1,000 responses have come in to date, with more continuing to be collected every day by my office. Many of the comments emphasised to me that families and businesses across the Central Coast are passionate about seeing our region thrive but also about making sure that we are safe and secure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Colleen from Kincumber said that she was concerned about drugs and crime in our community, as did Shauna from Somersby. Marie from

        said that we need more jobs for locals. But one issue that stood out was the price of energy. Charles from

         Umina Beach
        </a>
        said that if he could raise one issue in the parliament—and I do so now on your behalf, Charles—it would be that energy become more affordable. Roy from Saratoga said that the high cost of electricity was an issue for him. Garth from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Point" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        said that power prices were his No. 1 concern. Kerry from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Booker Bay
        </a>
        said that electricity and gas prices were out of control. Patricia, a pensioner from Erina, said that she and so many other people need to see lower electricity prices, while Warren from Umina Beach called electricity prices 'madness'. Alan in

         East Gosford
        </a>
        said the No. 1 issue in the community was the cost of living pressures. Jim from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Niagara Park
        </a>
        asked for reduced energy costs. James from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettalong_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Ettalong Beach
        </a>
        said that energy prices were his No. 1 issue on the Central Coast. Geoff in Terrigal said that the cost of living pressures were too high. I have been writing back to every single person, because, as you can hear, families and businesses are doing it tough. I will also be writing to inform them that our government is committed to tackling these issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week, the Prime Minister secured agreement from energy retailers on immediate measures and ongoing changes that are to be backed by law to put families and small businesses first. It includes contacting all customers who are on expired discounts and telling them how much they can save on a better deal, in easy-to-read language. We are demanding that companies report to the government and to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        on what they are doing to get families a better deals and also how many families remain on expired deals. We are also ensuring that families and individuals on hardship programs won't lose any benefit or discount for late payment. On top of this, we have moved to secure more gas supplies to put downward pressure on electricity prices. But, as so many locals have shared with me, there is more work to do, so I am looking forward to holding more community forums across the Central Coast in the coming weeks to continue this important conversation with my community and to hear from local residents about what really matters to them.

         Before I call the member for Fremantle, if no member present objects, three-minute constituency statements may continue for a total of 60 minutes. The member for Fremantle has the call.
