       <p>
        Last week I attended the Miller Health and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Family Day
        </a>
        in my electorate of Fowler. Information stalls by local service providers allowed parents to speak directly to the providers to get useful information regarding services that are available to them and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Children enjoyed a range of activities including a reptile zoo, a jumping castle and face painting. Everybody who attended was also treated to very good musical performances, including an adorable one by the young kids of Miller Cubbyhouse.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day represented a joint effort by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Mission Australia
        </a>
        , Miller Pathways and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspire_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Inspire Church
        </a>
        communities. I would like to praise the efforts of Leonie Green, Mission Australia's state manager; a very dedicated manager from Miller Pathways, Magdalena Liso; and Lucy Reggio, project officer with Miller Pathways.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to being hardworking, Lucy is also a volunteer with many other organisations in my community, assisting individuals and families in need, particularly those families living with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inspire Church was represented by Pastor John McMartin and his team, which greatly assisted in making the day such a success. The day was a great opportunity to celebrate family and to acknowledge the vital role that family plays in our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Families come in all shapes and sizes with different religious and cultural backgrounds, but they all come with a common interest: to stick together and provide children with love, care and support to help them grow into responsible adults.
