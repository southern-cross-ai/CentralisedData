        Last week was quite the week for great media reveals of previously undisclosed donations to political parties and campaigns. On Thursday we heard that Sportsbet, one of Australia's gambling giants, had donated $19,000 to the Minister for Communications, who oversees the regulation of gambling. On Friday, the ABC revealed that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_Prospecting" rel="nofollow">
         Hancock Prospecting
        </a>
        , controlled by Australia's richest person, who resides in my electorate,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Rinehart" rel="nofollow">
         Gina Rinehart
        </a>
        , donated an undisclosed $300,000 to the Liberal Party over the last two years. This enormous sum was undisclosed because it was transferred by a third party, the Sydney Mining Club. It seems likely that it was transferred in this way so it could remain undisclosed. This sum is more than the total that Hancock Prospecting has declared in donations to all political parties since 1988. Who knows if there is more. So the question asked of the Minister for Communications on Thursday can be asked again today of the Liberal Party. What influence has this hidden donation brought? What deal was made between Ms Rinehart, the Sydney Mining Club and the Liberal Party for the receipt of this money? How can we have a democracy that acts in the interests of its people if big business can secretly buy favours?
       </p>
       <p>
        My community demands more. If there is a loophole in Australia's disclosure laws that allows $300,000 in secret donations, the law needs to change.
