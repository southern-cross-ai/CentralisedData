       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I also commend you and congratulate you on your selection as Speaker. Today in this House stands a single white rose. It is a poignant reminder of a great community leader, the honourable member for Canning, who died of a heart attack doing what he loved. Today, I want to rise to pay tribute to another great community member in my electorate, Mickey Dean, who also recently died of a heart attack while playing football, which was a game that he loved. He was only 47.
       </p>
       <p>
        He scored the goal of the match in the first half, with some of his family members looking on. His dad told that he was proud of him. At half-time, he came off the field and during the second half of the match he collapsed and died of a heart attack. Even though there was a paramedic there, who was actually playing on the field with him, they were unable to save him. He was another great man taken all too suddenly from his family, his friends and his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I never knew Mickey, but I really wish I had. He was a coach, an active member of the Southern &amp; Ettalong United Football Club, the deputy captain of the Bays Rural Fire Service, a former surf lifesaver and a man who served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for 15 years. He was a man who was described at his funeral, held yesterday, as an outstanding role model with an extraordinary legacy of love, compassion, love for life and exuberance. Last Sunday, I joined about 400 people who stood in a minute's silence for Mickey on James Browne Oval at

        . I was honoured to meet his wife, Peta, and to meet his parents. I extend my deepest sympathy to his parents; his wife, Peta; and to his two teenage sons, Jared and Ethan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I heard some wonderful stories about this very great man. He was a man who was incredibly generous and who would tip tradies over and above what they ever charged just because. His club president, Gary Fish, had this to say about Mickey. I will read it out:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was Mickey's 10th year with the club, and for eighth of those he was also a coach of a junior side as well.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He did a lot of volunteering around the club – and would never think twice about offering a hand. You'd never have to go looking for him, and he didn't mind getting his hands dirty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a player Mickey was strong and fit – he once rode a pushbike 200km for charity – so it was a surprise to see this happen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Everyone loved being around him, and he always had a smile on his face – I'd describe him as a captain's pick, someone you'd always want on your team.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The club had a campaign – 'put your boots out for Mickey'. His son Ethan did that, then wore his dad's boots and his

       </p>
       <p>
        I will be joining them. We will be launching a petition in support of seeing defibrillators installed and/or provided to all community clubs on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Victoria is already leading the way in this important initiative. I am pleased to join Mickey, his club and the community in support of this very, very important initiative. Mickey, I never knew you, but thousands of your fellow committee members did and they loved you. You left a mark on their lives. This week, as I speak in a chamber with a white rose that stands in honour of the member for Canning, in your memory, Mickey, let me also stand alongside your family and your football club in support of this very, very important cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an important cause, because there were five deaths on football fields last year and four this year so far, including Mickey. While it is acknowledged that a defibrillator may not have helped in this particular instance, the facts are—and I know this as a surf lifesaver—that they dramatically increase the chances of survival for a sudden cardiac arrest if are applied quickly. While 30,000 Australians suffer from sudden cardiac arrest, only five per cent survive; but immediate access to this important piece of equipment can lead to a 70 per cent survival rate if applied quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        May I commend Central Coast Football, who are donating $500 to all football clubs on the Central Coast towards a defibrillator, and also the Men of Football on the Central Coast, who are donating $11,500 towards this as well. In honour of Mickey and for Peta, Jared, Ethan and his club, I stand here today to make a commitment to you—in the words of the club's motto—that we will never, ever give up. Vale, Mickey Dean.
