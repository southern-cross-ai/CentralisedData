       <p>
        I wish to draw the parliament's attention to the fact that the Mountain Cruizers 2016
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Show" rel="nofollow">
         Car Show
        </a>
        for charity was held on Sunday, 16 October 2016 at the Lithgow Showground. The Mountain Cruizers Car Club was formed in 2006 by a group of Lithgow car lovers who were keen to go for Sunday cruises and attend car shows. Over the years the club has grown to over 90 registered members from Lithgow and the surrounding areas. It has to be mentioned that the main aim of the club is to be a family club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mountain Cruizers also carry out community events such as raising money for charities in the Lithgow and district area, and this year was no different, with the 2016 car show raising money for Can Assist. This year marks the eighth charity car show. It featured some 125 cars, 20 bikes and over 10 trucks from all over the central west. The car show attracted a large variety of cars and a high number of visitors to Lithgow. This year was one of the biggest and best shows to date, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        markets, food stalls, live music and various stalls around the showground.
       </p>
       <p>
        It goes without saying that an event such as this cannot be organised without a dedicated committee behind it, and I must mention this committee now: Rodney Borland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Miller" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Miller
        </a>
        , Todd Nyitrai and the President of the Mountain Cruizers Car Club, Paul Sammut. I must also mention the support of a number of sponsors, including Mines Courier Services, Lithgow Tyre Service, G&amp;D Engineering, Zig Zag Motel,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JR" rel="nofollow">

        Engineering, RYCO and D&amp;J Ford Lithgow. I would like to congratulate the Lithgow Mountain Cruizers Car Club for hosting such a great community event. Well done and long may they continue to cruise.
