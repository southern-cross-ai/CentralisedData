        Today I want to pay tribute to a very good friend of mine and a really true believer who lies gravely ill in a palliative care unit at the

        Hospital. Peter Strachan—Strachy as he's known to his mates—was born in March 1949 in Melbourne, where he grew up and went to St Dominic's, St Kevin's and the University of Melbourne. He became a public servant in 1973. He spent his life serving the public. He became the regional manager of the

        in Alice Springs in 1992. He later joined and worked with Tangentyere Council and the

        . For 25 years he's been a member of the

        He met his wonderful wife, Faye—the love of his life—and was welcomed into a large network of family and friends. They had a daughter, Lara—the light of his life. He is a most devoted supporter of the Pioneer Football Club in the

        and, sadly, a Collingwood tragic. He's been my pew buddy at mass over many years. Strachy's now into time-on, having played the game of his life to the whistle without argument—riding the bumps, always putting his team and family first. Yesterday his daughter Lara's high school graduation ceremony took place at his bedside. He was surrounded by loving family and friends and the school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strachy is resolved as he confronts the time ahead. He is nurtured by his very strong faith. And, by his many barrackers, his family and his friends across the country, he is much loved.
