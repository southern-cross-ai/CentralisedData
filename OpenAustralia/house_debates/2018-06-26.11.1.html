        Today we celebrate last Saturday's opening of Beaumaris Secondary College. After the old 'Sandy College' campus fell into disrepair, a vision for a modern standalone Beaumaris Secondary College was the answer. Hundreds of residents attended: parents and grandparents, former students and aspiring ones, as well as state Sandringham MP Murray Thompson, Liberal candidate Brad Rowswell, Bayside Mayor Laurie Evans and fellow southern ward councillor Clarke Martin. The official ceremony, led by school captains Alice Tedstone and Fin Burgess, acknowledged former 'Sandy College' teacher Bob Whiteway

        , followed by the opening by the member for Mordialloc, with the school's foundation principal, Debby Chaves.

        My husband and I were fortunate to be given a tour by passionate School Council President Steve Pearce. The pride in the new school facilities was clear in the smiles and the smart uniforms that the year 7 students wore, and I'm proud to say I'm sporting one of their ties today. Equally exciting is the school's partnership with the

        , brought about by the leadership of the member for Sandringham, which led to co-investment in ovals and sports facilities for the school and the community. No single person owns Beauy Secondary's success. It is a victory for the Beauy community. Congratulations to everyone involved and best of luck to the year 7 students' first intake and for all future intakes of students to come. Congratulations.
