        I want to congratulate my home city of Ipswich on the 150th anniversary of being proclaimed a municipality. I congratulate the

         Ipswich City Council

        for its commemorative council meeting on 12 April 2010. Ipswich is the oldest provincial municipality in Queensland. It could and should have been the capital of Queensland. Long before Europeans arrived, the Ipswich area was home to the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul clans, who managed the land and waters in a sustainable and reverent way.

A team of convicts were then sent out to begin work at Limestone Hill. There are recorded conflicts between the Aboriginal clans of the area and the new arrivals.

        in 1842 and clearly showed that ‘Ipswich’ was to be the name for the new city. In 1860, after Queensland became a colony, Ipswich was proclaimed a municipality with a population of 3,000 people. The local industries included cotton, sugar, dairy farming, vineyards, woollen mills and coalmining. On a walk through the city centre at that time, you would have seen tailors, blacksmiths, milliners, watchmakers, grocers, cobblers, saddlers, coachbuilders and candle and soap makers. The 1880s saw coalmining grow to a significant industry in Ipswich, attracting migrants from

        to join German migrants who settled in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. Steam engines were used in boats, trains, mills and works and needed coal as fuel. Coalmines were located in suburbs like Blackstone, Dinmore,

        Ipswich was the birthplace of rail in Queensland. The first line was launched in 1865, and it ran between Ipswich and Grandchester. As far back as 1914 the railway workshops employed 1,500 workers. The population has ebbed and flowed, but Ipswich has grown and in 2010 it covers 1,090 square kilometres and has 6,000 heritage sites. It is the fastest-growing area in Queensland—with five per cent population growth, 166,000 people, 115 different ethnic backgrounds and 84 languages. It is a fast-growing area. Congratulations to Ipswich on its sesquicentenary.
