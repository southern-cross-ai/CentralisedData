        As a community, we all have a role to play in ensuring our kids are safe and well supported. I commend The Gap
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        on taking practical action to do just that by providing primary and secondary schoolchildren in the Ryan electorate with free bag tags. As well as looking good, the bag tags contain an easy and friendly guide that includes phone numbers that link to appropriate children's welfare, wellbeing and safety services. No matter what kids are dealing with—if they are feeling bullied at school, if they are feeling down or if they want somebody to talk to about what's happening at home—there is a number there that ensures they can get the support they need, and, because it's attached to their schoolbag, it is never far from reach. The Gap Neighbourhood Watch has already successfully supplied almost 1,500 bag tags to Payne Road State School,

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gap_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         The Gap State High School
        </a>
        . The numbers and information contained in the tags are tailored to each school and age group. Parents are also reporting that it's prompting a conversation at home about mental health and seeking support. The Gap Neighbourhood Watch have partnered with our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Ashgrove/The Gap to ensure all 2,518 students in The Gap get a bag tag. In July, I was delighted to sit down with volunteers from the Neighbourhood Watch to help assemble the tags and get them out to local students. I want to congratulate Jo Ingram and her dedicated volunteers at the Neighbourhood Watch for their selfless efforts to ensure local kids have the support they need so that, no matter what issue they are going through, they aren't dealing with it alone.
