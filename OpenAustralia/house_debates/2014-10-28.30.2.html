       </p>
       <p>
        The facilities will be at the

       <p>
        The proposed works will support Australia's advanced maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and response capability. The estimated cost of the project is $707.9 million, excluding

Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in late 2015 and is planned to be completed on all sites by late 2020. I commend the motion to the House.
