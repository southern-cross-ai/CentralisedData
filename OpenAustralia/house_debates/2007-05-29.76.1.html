       <p>
        I rise to draw the attention of the chamber to the community of the mid-north,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Plains
        </a>
        , Clare and Gilbert Valley, and the people who use the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_North_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Main North Road
        </a>
        , which runs between Gawler and Clare, and includes much of the commercial transport that heads off up the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Barrier Highway
        </a>
        . For a number of years, the condition of that road has been poor, and recently it has deteriorated even further. Back in 2005 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Automobile_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Automobile Association
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        commissioned a report called
        <i>
         Backwater to Benchmark
        </i>
        , which looked at the condition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        regional roads. It highlighted, even back then, the fact that this road was in dire need of upgrades it and it estimated that the cost of these upgrades would be around the $6 million mark.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since that time, the southern part of the road, between Tarlee and Gawler, has deteriorated further, with considerable undulations in the road. These have got to the point where not only is it uncomfortable to drive on that road in a motor car but also truck drivers are having problems with their backs. Some truck drivers in Riverton to whom I have spoken are off on WorkCover because of problems with their backs. The road has become dangerous. Loads that are satisfactorily secured for normal road conditions have become loose and have moved to the point of trucks rolling over on this stretch of road. It is a dangerous stretch of road which locals, peak bodies—such as the transport agencies and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAA" rel="nofollow">
         RAA
        </a>
        —and councils have for some time been calling for to be upgraded.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to thank the residents who have contacted me about this road and those who have worked with me, such as Mr Ted Malone, in Clare, and the proprietors of places like the Grasshopper Roadhouse in Tarlee and other roadhouses and shops up that road who have been prepared to have a petition calling on the government to put funding into that road. Some 3,799 signatures were obtained on that petition. Along with the councils, who have come together in their strategic directions for the region and have highlighted the need for investment in this road, the federal government, as a result of the budget this year, have put $6 million into the upgrade of this road.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are now calling for the Premier, Mr Rann, and the Treasurer, Mr Foley, in their coming state budget to match this funding. The road is a state government road. It is their responsibility. We have responded to the legitimate concerns of the community about safety, access and viability for the tourism, viticulture and agricultural industries. We have put that $6 million in, in response to the community, and we call on the South Australian government to step up to the mark to meet their responsibilities and to match that funding.
