        John Coombs, the former national secretary of the

        of Australia, passed away this morning. Most Australians remember John as a champion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">

        during the notorious Patrick waterfront dispute. The scenes of workers turning up for work to be confronted by dogs and men in balaclavas sent shockwaves throughout Australia. The entire workforce was sacked. Against all odds, resisting the might and power of government and business, John was tenacious in defence of his members and he won. His fight for justice resonated with workers around the country. I remember the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        congress that followed, where John was treated as a hero for every worker. People understood his fight was for his members but his victory empowered all workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a time, John and I lived around the corner from each other. He was forever proud of his membersâ€”not only when they fought for their own rights, but when they fought for others around the country and for those as far away as

        . He thought the world of

        , and I was in touch with Greg this morning. Greg said to me, 'As someone who spent many years working with John, sharing the experience of one of the most bitterly fought industrial disputes in our history, but more importantly having enjoyed the warmest and most deeply felt friendship and many wonderful occasions together, I feel John's passing very keenly.' I offer my condolences to Gwen and all of John's family and to all who loved him.
