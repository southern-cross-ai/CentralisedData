        My question is to the Prime Minister. After a successful six months of delivering for the Australian people, what is the Albanese Labor government progressing in this final week of parliament?

         I thank the member for Bendigo for her question and I congratulate her on the good weekend that she had. In our first six months we have moved Australia forward, after a decade of delay, denial and inaction under the previous government. Already we're delivering on what the Australian people voted for. We've made child care cheaper. We'll make medicines cheaper. We've increased the minimum wage and secured a pay rise for aged-care workers. We've established new climate targets. We've repaired our international relations. This week we're setting about delivering on more of our commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just this morning we were able to pass through the parliament, having accepted the amendments of the Senate, the respect at work legislation. Two years ago women, in their many thousands, marched not only on parliament here but also around the country to say enough is enough, to say that we need to act to ensure that all workplaces are safe and respectful. Today's legislation will do that.
        </p>
        <p>
         This week we're also committed to advancing the National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation that has already passed this House. It may well be that the opposition and the minor parties combine to try to stifle that, but we're determined to have a National Anti-Corruption Commission based upon the legislation that passed this House, that this House unanimously voted for.
        </p>
        <p>
         We'll also move to advance our secure jobs, better pay bill. We know those opposite, before they'd even read the legislation, decided to oppose it once they heard the title. They're not in favour of secure jobs and they're certainly not in favour of better pay. But what this will do is get wages moving. It will close the gender pay gap, it will ban pay secrecy clauses, it will advance the interests of working people and make sure that we have an economy that works for people not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
         We'll also report to parliament this week on Closing the Gap and we'll report on the first annual climate statement in accordance with the legislation that we passed earlier this year. Australians have made it clear, after a wasted decade, that they want a government that won't waste a day, and that is what we are delivering. We're determined to be worthy of the trust that has been placed in us. We have a mandate to secure change. Australians voted for that change and that is what the Labor government will be delivering.
