       <p>
        I was saddened recently at the death of a fine Australian in my electorate of

         Peter Carruthers

        has been an active advocate for the Leongatha
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and veteran community, not to mention a welcoming presence at every event I attended with him. I remember last year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        function at Leongatha with affection, with Peter a most worthy recipient of Leongatha and District's 2015 Australia Day Citizen of the Year award. As I wrote to Peter in the wake of that event, the Australia Day awards are an opportunity for the local community to pay tribute to you, a great Australian, whom we admire and whose selfless contribution makes a real difference to our local communities. Peter certainly fitted the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter was never motivated by awards, but, rather, a selfless dedication to others. It was evident in everything he did. Aside from his unwavering commitment to the RSL and veterans, I know he was also a keen golfer and golfing administrator and gave his all to the sport. As a former president and vice-president at the Foster Golf Club, not to mention a long-time
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
         South Gippsland
        </a>
        Men's secretary and president, he did a great deal to promote the game to young and old alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know he will be missed by his wife Carol and his children Scott, Mark, Helen, Greg and Dale, their partners, and his 10 young grandchildren. The wider community will mourn his passing too. Peter was a man of integrity and a credit to his family and community. The legacy he leaves behind is a big one. He may have departed in body, but his spirit will always remain in South Gippsland.
