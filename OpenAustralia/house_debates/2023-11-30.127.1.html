        The suburb of Banyo in my electorate of Lilley is home to the only group that's building batteries made out of 100 per cent Australian compounds and materials. I recently took the Minister for Industry and Science for a tour of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUT" rel="nofollow">
         QUT
        </a>
        Advanced Battery Facility and the Energy Storage Research Group based at the Banyo Pilot Plant Precinct. The Albanese government has announced a $392 million Industry Growth Program to support Lilley businesses to commercialise innovative ideas like this one and to expand their operations. Small and medium enterprises in Lilley will be able to receive advice from industry experts to apply for grants from $50,000 to $5 million. This is exactly the kind of investment that we need on the north side to support local jobs and deliver a future made in Australia.

        Residents of Brisbane's northern bayside in my election of Lilley have been waiting for more than a decade to see the Brighton Foreshore revitalised. In 2011, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        paused a promised multimillion-dollar rejuvenation project ostensibly due to financial pressures caused by the Brisbane floods of the same year. Nearly 13 years later I'm pleased as the federal member for Lilley that I have been able to deliver on an election promise to commit $5 million to the Brighton Foreshore upgrade alongside the Councillor for Deagon Ward, Jared Cassidy. A concept plan for Brighton Foreshore is now open for public consultation and outlines more opportunities for recreation, relaxing and meeting with family and friends in one of the many places that make the electorate of Lilley great. I urge Lilley locals to have a look at the Brighton Foreshore concept plan on the Brisbane City Council website at the moment and to offer your feedback online or to attend a local information session.

        On 23 October, 5,000 Northsiders turned out to enjoy market stores, food trucks and free entertainment at our inaugural Geebung Street Party. The community event was inspired by the 70th birthday of the Geebung State School to celebrate the history and the future of this vibrant suburb.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would especially like to thank the council for Deagon Ward, the member for Aspley and their teams, the event sponsors, the Geebung

        and Kuhn Corp Print &amp; Packaging for making this great family celebration such an outstanding success.
       </p>
       <p>
        With my bonus remaining time, may I congratulate Min Woo Lee on his outstanding success at the
