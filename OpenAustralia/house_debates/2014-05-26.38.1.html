        A great event happened over the weekend, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and you have probably heard about it—Beef Week 2014 began in Casino,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . I congratulate Stuart George and all his team on, once again, getting this great iconic event in our community off the ground. A lot of work goes into organising an event like this, as you would know. I want to take a bit of issue with the speech made earlier by the member for Capricornia. Mr Deputy Speaker, even though you are a Queenslander, you know that the beef capital of Australia is Casino—and do not listen to anything else.
       </p>

        On Saturday night at the festival we had the crowning of Miss Beef Week. I congratulate Brooke Hancock, who is the Casino Beef Week Queen for this year, and the other six contestants. They were all winners and they would have all been great ambassadors for the festival and the town. On Sunday the festival moved to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Evans Head
        </a>
        . We had a great event down there organised by Brian O'Farrell. There was a parade and over the next week are going to have fashion parades, rodeos and a lot, lot more. I encourage anyone who has not been to come along and experience the event. It runs for just over a week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be very interested to know that the theme of Beef Week this year is Heroes and Villains. That is very interesting to say, because we all know where the villains are in this chamber—they are over that side.
