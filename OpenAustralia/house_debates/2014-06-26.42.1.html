        Two schools from Durack visited

        this week to participate in the parliamentary education program. Students from the Kimberley and the

        Schools of the Air got a wonderful taste of Australia's parliamentary process—and I will just give them a wave now. Hi, kids. There are five Schools of the Air in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , of which four are in Durack. They are based in Derby, Port Hedland, Carnarvon and Geraldton. Each has around 10 staff members and between 30 and 50 students—all up, just under 200. Most schools have been operating for many years. In fact, Port Hedland turns 50 this year. These unique schools provide distance education to students who are geographically isolated or who cannot attend mainstream schools. They may live on a station, in a roadhouse or perhaps in an Aboriginal community. Teachers support home tutors— who are often the parents—and students via email, phone, web conferencing and home visits. They do whatever it takes to give these children an education. Daily online lessons and regular camps enable students to interact with their peers and have face-to-face sessions with teachers.

        I enjoyed speaking with the students and teachers this week and applaud the principals, Gregory Yeo of the Kimberley and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jennings" rel="nofollow">

        of Port Hedland, who have invited me to present students their certificates during a lesson over the air to commemorate their visit to Parliament House. Be assured that provision of sustainable and quality education for our people in the bush, no matter where they live, is a top priority of mine.
