         It is getting a jubilant reception in the House of Representatives—that is lovely! I can advise the House that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Excellency" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         the Governor-General has today written to the couple extending the warmest congratulations of the Australian people. All of us join with the Governor-General in wishing the couple well.

         Mr Speaker, being an ardent reader of magazines, I am sure you are aware that speculation has swirled for some time about a possible royal wedding. Speculation does tend to swirl on such matters. Now we know that a royal wedding will occur. We know that a royal wedding involves considerations beyond the personal and the domestic. It marks the start of a lifelong journey in the service of the British people.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Middleton" rel="nofollow">
          Kate Middleton
         </a>
         begins that journey with our best wishes and our support. By all accounts, Ms Middleton is a down-to-earth young woman with the grace and good humour necessary for the role in front of her and the challenging decades ahead. As
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William" rel="nofollow">
          Prince William
         </a>
         showed on his visit to Australia earlier this year, he is a young man of great charm and a high sense of duty who is able to connect with working people, with ordinary people, and he did that whilst here in Australia. He has a deep instinct for charitable work and community work.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a happy day for the royal family and a happy day for the Middleton family. We know the pride they must be feeling and they must also have the dawning sense that this is no ordinary wedding. But today we look beyond the pageantry to see two young people very much in love and we personally wish them well.

          On indulgence: I rise as leader of her Majesty’s loyal opposition to support the statement by the Prime Minister and to congratulate her on the enthusiasm and dignity which she has shown on this occasion. As leader of her Majesty’s loyal opposition, I also rise to congratulate

          on their engagement. I say that every Australian should rejoice at their happiness on this day. The royal family, like any family, can feel ‘the thousand natural shocks/ That flesh is heir to’. Even so, its members have exemplified duty and service and inspired millions in this country and throughout the world.
         </p>

          Prince William visited Australia earlier this year. He first saw Australia from the arms of his mother, Diana, the late
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_of_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           Princess of Wales
          </a>
          , in 1983. Australians have always shown great warmth to members of the royal family, and we look forward to welcoming Prince William and his bride as soon as that can be managed.
