        While the flat-earthers that inhabit the coalition are too busy high-fiving each other's foreheads for pushing Australia into reverse gear on climate change, if they let the ringing in their ears die down for a bit they would hear the protests of the general public about the budget they have inflicted on Australia. The coalition have not been content to spare any part of society from the cuts they have inflicted on people, but yesterday we had the Treasurer walk in and deliver the biggest dummy spit that we have seen a long time, because he cannot get his changes through. Those people on the opposite side promised all things to all people. They said there would be no cuts to health and no cuts to education.

        was also asked whether he would use the condition of the budget as an excuse to break promises. He said—exactly right—that he would not.

        tax to $15, abolishing family tax benefit part B—further cuts, further hurt to the Australian public. None of you guys said you would do that. You should go back to your electorates and explain why you are dudding the people who voted for you.
