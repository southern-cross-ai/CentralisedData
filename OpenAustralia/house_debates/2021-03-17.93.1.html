         I thank the member for her question. The member for Lindsay and I launched the Girls in

         Toolkit in her electorate back in 2019. That toolkit was actually so successful that, in the last budget, we actually committed more money to expanding that. In fact, in the last budget, this government committed over $50 million for programs that were specifically designed to improve gender equity in STEM. We know that we have to decrease the gap between the number of male students and the number of female students that study STEM subjects when they're at school and go on to study STEM at higher levels and move into STEM careers. Increasing participation in STEM is absolutely vital for the jobs of the future and also for our economy. A few years ago, it was estimated that, if just one person in 100 shifted to a STEM role over the next 20 years, it would increase our nation's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         by $57.4 billion. We also know that STEM skills are vital for the jobs of the future, and probably even more so for those jobs that we're not even aware of at the moment that are still to be developed in the future.

         , Dr Cathy Foley, address us as part of Science meets Parliament. Dr Foley herself is an extraordinary woman in STEM, and she had this to say about increasing the participation of women in STEM: 'Simply put, diversity of ideas and experience equals better results.' It's absolutely true. How can we look to solve the great challenges that we face or take advantage of the exciting opportunities in STEM if we're not embracing the skills, knowledge and perspectives of our entire population? If we're drawing on only half the talent pool, we are likely to achieve only half the results that we could. That is behind our rationale in appointing the first Women in STEM Ambassador, Professor Lisa Harvey-Smith, and it's what drives her to make sure that we are getting young girls, in particular, more interested in studying science and maths at school and going on to undertake careers in STEM. It gives them the opportunity to secure a fulfilling job for the future, and it boosts our economy. Quite frankly, it's a win-win for all.
