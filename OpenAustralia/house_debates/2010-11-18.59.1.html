       <p>
        Today I want to talk about Mr Tony Manuli, a gentleman from my electorate. I promised him that I would get this on the record. But first, to set the scene: I am sure we all know who the Englishman named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crapper" rel="nofollow">
         Thomas Crapper
        </a>
        is and what he is supposed to be famous for. Well, he did not really invent the flush toilet, but his name is indeed a cloud that hovers over it in history. Did he really give his name to these systems? No, the name was likely derived from the 13th century Anglo-Saxon word crappe. So not only was he not the inventor of the flush toilet; it is also unlikely that he really gave it its name either. What he did was carry the technology forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Manuli informed me that he and his partner Jozsef Havasi did invent the dual flush toilet system. I have in my hand the patent application dated and stamped by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Patent_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Patent Office
        </a>
        on 19 June 1979. Mr Manuli delivered this system idea to Caroma in the same year for appraisal and was told they were not interested. In a book entitled
        <i>
         Imagination—100 Years of Bright Ideas in Australia
        </i>
        , I read that in 1980, only one year later, the Caroma company in Adelaide released its revolutionary DuoSet dual flush cistern. What a surprise! It certainly was for Mr Manuli.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the way, Mr Manuli is not looking for compensation, just recognition.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lynch" rel="nofollow">

        said, ‘The flush toilet, more than any single invention, has “civilised” us in a way that religion and law could never accomplish.’ As the member for Swan I am proud to have in my electorate a man who contributed an invention that has saved so much water. It is something we should all reflect on next time we are sitting down.
