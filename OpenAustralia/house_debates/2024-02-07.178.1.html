        I rise to speak and welcome my constituents and my colleagues into the new year of 2024. I hope everyone had a restful and refreshing break and gave themselves a pat on the back for seeing off 2023.

        The electorate of Aston is a little unusual in the sense that its boundaries match those of the local council boundaries—that is, Knox. There is just the one
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
         LGA
        </a>
        for the one federal electorate, one of only a handful the country. I believe it is important to work collaboratively across all levels of government to achieve what is best for our shared local community. That is why I'm disappointed that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Knox City Council
        </a>
        does not welcome elected government representatives, state or federal, as stallholders at their local community events like the upcoming Knox Festival in March. As a federal government representative my role is talking to my constituents about issues that affect them, assisting them with all Services Australia inquiries, visa issues, aged-care assistance, federal grants of all kinds—there is a long list. These are all apolitical things that people in my electorate might need help with navigating. Other state and federal MPs around the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne can enjoy being stallholders at their council-run festivals and can help their constituents with issues that affect them. I have made repeated attempts to explain to the council how I could assist residents of Knox. It is a real shame that Knox City Council doesn't allow government representatives to hold stalls at council festivals; plenty of other councils do. I plan to still attend the Knox Festival for a few hours, but not as a stallholder, like I did last year during the 2023 by-election campaign. This time I'll be attending as the member for Aston, not as a political candidate. I look forward to catching up with everyone there on the day.
       </p>

        To end on a positive note, I would like to mention that the lunar new year is quickly approaching. I wish everyone who celebrates it a wonderful lunar new year, the year of the dragon. The lunar new year has become an integral part of the Australian calendar in our wonderful community in Aston, and everything is a lovely shade of red as everyone starts to prepare for it. It's an occasion for family, friends and festivities. So whether you are celebrating Chinese new year, the Tet festival or Seollal, I hope the year of the dragon brings you good health, prosperity and boundless happiness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I love heading out in my electorate and seeing my constituents in person. I thank you again for your ongoing kindness and faith throughout last year, and I'm looking forward to having another great and productive year with you all. As always, as your federal member, I continue to work hard every day to deliver for you and to hear you.
