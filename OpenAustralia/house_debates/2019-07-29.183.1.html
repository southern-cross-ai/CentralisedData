       <p>
        On Saturday I had the great privilege of attending a special award ceremony in the electorate of Lindsay. That was a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout
        </a>
        award. It went to a very outstanding young citizen, Jarrod Matthews, who is in our electorate. The 1st South Penrith Scout Group hosted that very special occasion. I had the opportunity to speak with his mum, Chrissie, after the ceremony, and she was rightly very proud of her child and spoke about the hard work he put in over a year to get this special award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jarrod will officially be presented with the award by the Governor-General of Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hurley" rel="nofollow">

        , in August. That is an outstanding achievement for a young person. He spoke about the things that he had to do to get this award, and he said there were four areas: adventurous activities, community involvement, leadership development and personal growth. It was particularly the community activities, where he participated in work with an organisation called Platform Youth Services, who look after homeless kids in the electorate of Lindsay, which impressed me a lot. I really want to acknowledge Jarrod for his outstanding achievement. The future is bright when we have young people like this doing this great work, and I wish him all the best in the future.
