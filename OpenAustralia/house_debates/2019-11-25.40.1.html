        I would like to recognise a very important organisation in my community. The
        <i>

          Koori Mail
         </a>
        </i>
        is a fortnightly national newspaper that reports stories for Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people. Founded in 1991, the newspaper has grown to a point where it is now recognised as the voice for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australia
        </a>
        . It is 100 per cent Aboriginal owned. Currently it is owned by the five Bundjalung Aboriginal community organisations. The
        <i>

        </i>
        has a great staff made up of general and sports columnists as well as a network of correspondents and contributors from throughout the country. Today it is led by the general manager, Naomi Moran, and its editor, Rudy Maxwell. Naomi has a wonderful story. She joined the paper in 1998 as 15-year-old trainee. Naomi began working as receptionist and she worked in almost all sections of the paper before becoming its manager in 2016.

        I couldn't speak about the
        <i>

        </i>
        without recognising Russell Kapeen. Russell sadly passed away earlier this year after chairing the organisation for the past 24 years. He was deeply involved with land rights for decades and was an outstanding leader in our community. Every cent of the profit goes to

         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        . They offer scholarships for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and often sponsor local Indigenous community events. To all the staff, past and present, and everyone who has supported the paper, I thank you. The
        <i>

        is a wonderful institution and I'm very proud that its home is in my community.
