        There are over 300 people in my local community who are employed in the

         Australian Public Service
        </a>

But how can we trust the Prime Minister and the Liberals to govern the nation in the interests of all Australians when they cannot even responsibly fulfil their power as an employer? We know that this governmentâ€”
