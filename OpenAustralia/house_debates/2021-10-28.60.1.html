        Sometimes you meet people who are 100 per cent dedicated to helping others, and every day they try to find a way to give back, but it's not often you find this level of altruism in someone as young as Zachary Rowswell from Jerrabomberra Public School. This year, on multiple occasions, eight-year-old Zach has inspired his school and the Jerrabomberra community to give to those less fortunate. In May he held a fundraiser and encouraged people to donate to the Queanbeyan sleepbus. He said, 'Homeless people need somewhere safe to sleep.' He raised over $3,000 for the sleepbus. But he didn't stop there. As the weather turned cold, he had another idea and started collecting winter clothing to donate to people in need. Through his efforts, he managed to collect more than 120 items of clothing, including warm pants, coats and jumpers, and donate them to three local charities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now this local hero has set his sights on Christmas, and he's once again encouraging people to give to others. He is collecting gifts to donate to Kids in Care
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        . To quote Zach: 'It's cool to be kind, and don't forget: adults need Christmas gifts too.' Thank you, Zach. Not only are you inspiring the next generation to give back, to volunteer and to help others, but you're also proving how one person, no matter their age, can make a huge difference.
