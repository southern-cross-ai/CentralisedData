        It's the role of government to create conditions in which people can flourish. That's why I have been working hard to improve job opportunities for people in Canning at all stages of their working lives. Last month, I was pleased to open the Mandurah Regional Trades Skills Centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coodanup_Community_College" rel="nofollow">
         Coodanup Community College
        </a>
        . This centre was made possible with a $3.3 million grant from the federal government. This centre is a vocational education hub where students prepare for trades in painting, plumbing, building and gas fitting. Ready access to vocational training is vital to help more young people secure good jobs. This centre is about backing the next generation of Mandurah tradies and small business owners.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those at a different stage in their careers, the Stronger Transitions Package is welcome news. This $10.3 million fund will assist Mandurah workers, who are facing retrenchment, find new jobs. I'm proud the government is backing workers in Canning, through what is a difficult time in anyone's working life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition is also helping local businesses like Segnut, which received a federal government grant of $519,000 to commercialise their product. Segnut is a new nut designed by Mandurah innovator Brian Bradshaw that enables the removal of bolts in a fraction of the time. It's a game changer for heavy industrial maintenance that is safer for workers and more affordable for business. Smart inventions inject life into our economy. It's important to back local people having a go with new ideas. These announcements are good news for the working people of Canning, and I will continue to fight for their economic security.
