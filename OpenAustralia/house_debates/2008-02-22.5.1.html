        , the ‘Rudd day off’, I would like to point to a number of commitments that were secured during the election campaign from the Howard government if it were to be re-elected. I am sad that the Minister for Sport is not here to hear about a number of those, but I hope to follow up my advocacy through correspondence with her. There were a number of issues raised of great importance to the local community. The new basketball facility at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        needs some enhancements for traffic and pedestrian movement, given the vast number of families that attend the venue. We secured a commitment for the Ballam Park athletics complex so that it could host regional, state and, where we could secure the opportunity, national athletics events. We also looked for support for the redevelopment of the Eric Bell Reserve in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_North" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . That support has been a long time coming and was something that a re-elected Howard government was committed to. Also, at Langwarrin, a rapidly growing area, Lloyd Park is one of the only focal points for activities for a growing number of young people. Again, there was a Howard government commitment to help with that redevelopment.

        What was noticeable in Dunkley was the stealth-like campaign the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        ran. As they were trading on the ‘cult of Kevin’, we heard nothing from the local candidate, nothing from the central campaign and, in fact, nothing from any Labor advocate in the area about any of these projects. I can only assume that that was a ringing endorsement of these projects—projects which should be carried forward by the Rudd government.
