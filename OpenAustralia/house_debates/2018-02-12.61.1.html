        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        jobs are being shed in Hobart despite an assurance from the government that this would not occur. Indeed, I'm told that whenever an ICT specialist moves to another role the department doesn't refill the position and staff are being told that at the end of their current assignments they'll be deployed elsewhere. In other words, the government is reneging on its promise by stealth. Prime Minister, will you commit to stop the shedding of Hobart ICT jobs and give an assurance more broadly that the government will maintain at least the current number of Public Service jobs in Hobart?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. The government recognises the importance of a strong and responsive Public Service. Ultimately the role of the Public Service is to deliver services for the public as efficiently as possible. That's why we're constantly looking for ways to improve the quality of services delivered by the Public Service, including through our commitment to digital transformation. In relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">

         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
          ICT
         </a>
         staff, I'm advised that these employees are currently responsible for supporting the work of the National Disability Insurance Agency, including help desk work. As to the member's assertion that staff would be redeployed elsewhere after their current assignments, I can assure the member for Denison that the minister's department, the Department of Human Services, will continue to offer these employees a position within that department, including opportunities for being positioned in Hobart, ensuring that people can stay in their home town.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'd also add that the staffing profile of the Department of Human Services in Tasmania is substantial, at 1,904 employees across the state, according to its last annual report. And the government, as the honourable member I'm sure agrees, is absolutely committed to ensuring that all Tasmanians get the services they need. I just note to the honourable member, before I conclude, that last year 7,700 new jobs were created in Tasmania. Tasmania is seeing strong economic growthâ€”

          The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Denison on a point of order.

           Yes, on relevance: the question had two parts. The second was to do with whether any broader assurance could be given about the number of Public Service jobs in Hobart.

            The question did have two parts, but the Prime Minister's completely in order. He's able to address them in whichever way he wishes.

             So, 7,700 new jobs in Tasmania is of the greatest relevance to the families in Tasmania, one of whose members has won one of those jobs. I would note, in conclusion, that Tasmania is seeing strong economic growth, and it's seeing it in large part based on the trade deals negotiated by the coalition, particularly the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It will be a big beneficiary of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
              TPP
             </a>
             -11, and I'm sure will benefit from the free trade agreement with Peru that we are about to sign with the honourable minister who's in the public gallery. Finally, I would note that there are 49,800 small and medium businesses in Tasmania benefiting from the government's tax cuts to small and medium businesses, overwhelmingly Australian-owned, overwhelmingly family businesses.
