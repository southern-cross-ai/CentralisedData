       <p>
        Over the weekend I had the opportunity to witness some amazing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        public schools participating in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_Spectacular" rel="nofollow">
         Schools Spectacular
        </a>
        â€”an opportunity for talented primary and secondary students to showcase their talents in creative arts. This is an event that brings kids from all over New South Wales together to perform. I would like to mention those in my electorate of Lindsay who were able to perform as a result of their own talents being nurtured through New South Wales public schools, their parents and, importantly, their teachers who support them and coach them. Showcasing their ability in this way builds self-esteem, confidence and resilience in young people.

        I am pleased that there were kids from Kingswood High School,

        ,

        </a>
        and Glenmore Park High School, along with Nepean Creative and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_Arts_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Performing Arts High School
        </a>
        , Samuel Terry Public School and Cambridge Park Public School. In particular I would like to mention Brooke Paulley and Elyse Sene-Lefao who were the local vocal featured artists and performed two solos in that show. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them for their hard work. I would also like to acknowledge Telstra,

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEG" rel="nofollow">

        Ogden for their support, and without whom it would not be possible to have such an event. I would like to again take the opportunity to remind the government of the importance of funding Gonski and school education so events like this and kids like these can be nurtured to their full potential and given opportunities such as these.
