       <p>
        In Chisholm, and indeed across Australia, sport is the favourite pastime. It promotes wonderful things, such as physical fitness, friendship, teamwork and leadership. In Chisholm, our sporting clubs would not be the Australian institutions that they are if it were not for the commitment of the many administrators, parents and volunteers who tirelessly support the clubs that they love. I'm proud to be part of the Turnbull government, as we back and support many local sporting clubs, including many clubs that have worked hard to ensure the active participation of young people in sport at the local grassroots level. Encouraging young girls to play sports that were traditionally in the male domain is also an important focus.
       </p>
       <p>
        My commitment to supporting local sporting groups is further enhanced by Stronger Communities Program grants. In round 3 of the program, I'm pleased to announce that a number of local sporting club applications were successful. They include the Harlequin Rugby Club, Nunawading Basketball Association, Kerrimuir United Cricket Club, Nunawading City Soccer Club, Eastern Lions Soccer Club, Ashwood Sports Club, Mount Waverley City Soccer Club, North Box Hill Tennis Club and Box Hill United Pythagoras Soccer Club. They were all successful in their applications for grants with a particular focus on backing locals in sport and providing appropriate infrastructure to facilitate their participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clubs such as these and many more across Chisholm are actively looking forward to the future in sport. This is why I have been so passionate about delivering on my election commitments to both the Waverley Gymnastics Centre and the Waverley District Netball Association. It was an absolute delight to turn the sod at the site of the upgrades to the associations' facilities in Ashwood and to see my election commitment of $890,000 in funding realised, as I know that these essential upgrades will encourage local girls and women to participate. In particular, I'd like to congratulate President Angela Mylrea of the Waverley District Netball Association on her commitment to advocating for her association and for her passion for building an inclusive and supportive netball community in Ashwood.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an avid netballer when I was younger, and having raised my two children to understand the values and benefits that playing team sport provides, I'm committed to the view that, for young people particularly, playing team sport at the local level promotes fitness, fun, teamwork, friendship, camaraderie and, most important of all, a wonderful sense of community. The upgrades from this funding will mean that local sport in Chisholm will get the enhancement and support it needs to cement the current participation and, indeed, encourage even further participation.
