        There are some things our society simply should not tolerate and domestic violence is top of the list. It must stop. In my former career as a police officer, I saw the devastating toll family violence takes on victims, including children, loved ones, friends, colleagues and communities. Family violence does not discriminate. It is present in every part of society—the rich, the poor, city, country, any culture or background, all variations of relationships, women, men and children can all be affected—and we need to take a stand against it. Any form of abuse by men or women whether it is physical, emotional, social or financial is unacceptable. Research from the 2012 ABS Personal Safety Survey and the

        shows both men and women can experience domestic violence, yet the study also found that one woman every week was killed by their current or former partner. The research shows that one in six women from age 15 experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or former partner, and one in 19 men from age 15 experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or former partner. The same research shows one in four women from the age of 15 experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner, and one in seven men from age 15 experienced emotional abuse from a current or former partner. In May 2015, the Australian Institute of Criminology reported on family violence incidents between 2002 and 2012, showing 60 per cent of victims of all domestic homicides were female, and that males were the offenders in 77 per cent of intimate partner homicides. Another 2010 to 2012

        study found that there were 26 male and 83 female victims of intimate partner homicide.

        This problem has been kept behind closed doors for too long and it is time we said, 'No more.' The coalition government is leading the charge against domestic and family violence, investing $200 million to end this serious social problem. This includes $21 million to help Indigenous women in communities. Additionally, we are delivering a $100 million action plan to keep people safe in their homes. This funding includes $30 million for front-line legal assistance to fight family violence with $16.5 million supporting community legal centres. The government is working to stop domestic abuse, but we must all play a part in creating a society where all women, children and men live in safety. As a man, I say only cowards and those weak of character commit family violence, but it is up to all of us to wipe out the scourge of this violence altogether.
