        I've always believed that education is the great enabler. Good quality education transforms personal circumstances, allows us to provide for our families, fills skill shortages and contributes to long-term economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government believes that postcode and income shouldn't be a barrier to accessing these life-changing educational opportunities. That's why we promised that we would deliver 180,000 fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        places to assist in upskilling the nation. This was at a time when our country was facing a serious skills shortage under the mismanagement of the former government. In fact, according to the National Skills Commission's 2022 skills priority list which was released last year, more than half of our largest-employing occupations were facing skills shortages. We knew we had to do something to get our economy back on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I'm pleased to say that, since we made our fee-free TAFE promise in 2022, the Albanese government have not just delivered on our commitment to provide 180,000 fee-free TAFE places; we've reached over 214,000 enrolments so far. This means there are 214,000 fee-free TAFE places to educate our future construction workers, hospitality workers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        workers, as well as health, disability, aged care and early education workers here in Greenway and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, of course, it means we can increase our sovereign capability in areas like manufacturing and defence. Fee-free training offers huge cost-of-living relief for students, grows the recruitment pool for businesses and eases the skill shortages that hold our economy back. Our commitment also promises to provide access to priority cohorts, including women,

        and those living with a disability. In the words of the Minister for Skills and Training,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         Brendan O'Connor
        </a>
        : 'Fee-Free TAFE is the spark that is igniting a renewed sense of optimism and potential in our vocational education and training sector and I'm looking forward to building on our success.'
       </p>
       <p>
        With some 7,000 students already attending our Blacktown TAFE, I, too, look forward to seeing how this fantastic commitment benefits the good, hardworking people of north-west Sydney now and into the future.
