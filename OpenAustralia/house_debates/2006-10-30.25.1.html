       <p>
        Today I make a final appeal to the government to save the life of the Reva—the emission-free carbon-neutral electric car, which the Howard government has demanded be crushed later this week. Last week I visited the outlet for Reva, which is the Solar Shop in my electorate. I have learnt how this car attracts government subsidies in both Japan and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and of the measures taken across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        to encourage the expansion of this market of environmentally friendly vehicles. Yet here the Howard government are too short-sighted to create a new category for registration of these impressive vehicles. When it comes to climate change we, once again, see the Howard government trailing behind global efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I again appeal to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        , Territories and Roads to save the Reva. As these appeals have so far fallen on deaf ears I have also today written to the UK Conservatives leader, Mr David Cameron, and asked him to have a word to our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        on this issue. Mr Cameron is very keen on the Reva, being photographed with it for publicity purposes. He has stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help tackle climate change we must be for greener cars … Today, many families want to become greener, and they’re looking for more options to go green. We should help them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I agree with these sentiments. Our Prime Minister loves to follow the lead of conservative foreign leaders. I urge him to follow this lead and save the Reva and provide a framework for the future expansion of the low-emission vehicle industry. To see this car crushed would be a tragedy, and I will continue to fight against this and to fight for this industry.
