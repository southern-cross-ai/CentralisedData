        Keeping people safe on our roads is something that is incredibly important to me, particularly given the massive electorate that I represent and the huge road network contained therein.

        I was pleased to officially open the dual-lane Tone Bridge on the Cranbrook road last week. The previous bridge was a 90-year-old timber single-lane bridge and was inadequate for the traffic using the road. This upgrade will now provide safer access in and out of the Shire of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyup_Brook" rel="nofollow">

        , particularly for the school buses, caravans and heavy haulage vehicles which regularly use the road. Vehicles will also not have to stop and give way to oncoming traffic when approaching the bridge. This was not only difficult; it was dangerous for large trucks and road trains carrying very heavy loads.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the WA government for contributing the matching funding for this project, as well as the Boyup Brook shire and shire president Graham Aird for facilitating the project. I know the new bridge will stand the test of time and last for at least another 100 years, and I congratulate the contractors,

        The federal government contributed $2.45 million towards the $5 million project through the Bridges Renewal Program. This program provides funds to upgrade and replace bridges to improve access for local communities and allow for increased traffic movements. My electorate has benefited from over $7.5 million in funding, including in the town of Williams, where $5 million has been allocated to replace two bridges. Both bridges take
