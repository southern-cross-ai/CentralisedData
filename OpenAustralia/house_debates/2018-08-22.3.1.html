        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) increased immunisation of children, which is essential for protecting them against diseases including pneumonia, polio, rotavirus diarrhoea, meningococcal and measles now saves the lives of 2 to 3 million children per year but, nevertheless, 1.5 million children still die each year from vaccine-preventable diseases;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) in 2017, 85 per cent of children globally received the full course of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine, a key measure of vaccine coverage, however, this left nearly 20 million children not covered by this vaccine;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) globally, 85 per cent of children receive the polio vaccine, however, gaps in polio vaccine coverage allow some children to contract the disease, with 13 cases in 2018 so far;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to which Australia has been a consistent contributor, has supported the vaccination of more than 640 million children, and saved an estimated 9 million lives; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) in December 2018, Gavi will hold a mid-term review to assess what changes to its strategy are needed to achieve increased and equitable access to vaccines;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia co-sponsored a resolution at the Seventieth World Health Assembly in 2017 to accelerate access to vaccines, calling for the extension of immunisation services beyond infancy, increasing domestic financing, and strengthening international cooperation to achieve global vaccination goals; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) current funding by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), to which Australia contributes, is due to decline significantly as polio nears eradication—this funding covers one fifth of the World Health Organisation's costs, and accounts for a high proportion of the health and vaccination workforce in several countries; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) participate in planning to accelerate progress in making vaccines available to all children, including through the Gavi mid-term review; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) work with countries now receiving polio support and with multilateral agencies to ensure that transition from GPEI funding results in increased resources for other health and vaccinations programs.
