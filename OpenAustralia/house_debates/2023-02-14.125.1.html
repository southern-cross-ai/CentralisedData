        Labor is red; the Liberals are blue; on this Valentine's Day I have a poem for you:
       </p>
       <p>
        In just 12 months so much is new
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's have a look at what we've all been through;
       </p>
       <p>
        Back then our ex-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        did not hold a hose
       </p>
       <p>
        Said t'was not a race—did he lie? Macron knows;
       </p>
       <p>
        We went to an election and the choice was easy
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia did choose Prime Minister Albanese;
       </p>
       <p>
        His plan for a better future is what the country had needed
       </p>
       <p>
        A positive vision for Australia as PM Morrison receded;
       </p>
       <p>
        Onto these benches were moved, and that's when it all came out
       </p>
       <p>
        All the secrets they'd been hiding, all the mistruths they had spout;
       </p>
       <p>
        Weeks before the poll, in a cunning secret of plot
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Hume gave nondisclosure a shot
       </p>
       <p>
        No, it wasn't doctored travel receipts—it was much worse
       </p>
       <p>
        It was Minister Taylor's secret hit to the purse;
       </p>
       <p>
        A 20 per cent jump in the price of our power
       </p>
       <p>
        Kept hidden during the campaign, released in the final hour;

         On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. That's in clear breach of the standing orders, casting inferences against another member, and he shouldn't be doing it.

          <p>
           Thank you:
          </p>
          <p>
           But that wasn't all, and the truth did flow
          </p>
          <p>
           Because there was much, much more Australia did not know;
          </p>
          <p>
           Prime Minister Morrison was not busy enough
          </p>
          <p>
           So he started coveting his colleagues' stuff;
          </p>
          <p>
           With Josh as his Treasurer and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
            Greg Hunt
           </a>
           in health
          </p>
          <p>
           Our ex-
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
            PM
           </a>
           decided to do those jobs in stealth;
          </p>
          <p>
           Without telling the public, he played his constitutional tricks
          </p>
          <p>
           Deciding he was so good at his job he would take on another six;
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite this betrayal, this detailed hidden proof
          </p>
          <p>
           His colleagues could not criticise despite the harsh truth.
          </p>
          <p>
           In contrast, our new PM has led from the front
          </p>
          <p>
           Tackling challenges head on and not being such a—stick in the mud;
          </p>
          <p>
           Already we've enacted a wave of reform
          </p>
          <p>
           And anticorruption commission and Public Service to transform;
          </p>
          <p>
           There's fee-free
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           places, new spots at uni too
          </p>
          <p>
           We're fixing aged care and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           for you;
          </p>
          <p>
           We're helping to relieve costs, with cheaper child care
          </p>
          <p>
           There's discounted medicines and a budget to repair;
          </p>
          <p>
           And this year we embark on a constitutional choice
          </p>
          <p>
           On whether we should have an Indigenous voice;
          </p>
          <p>
           The reasons are clear: to give our
