       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. After repeatedly refusing to say exactly how many Australian families will be worse off because of the Prime Minister's cuts to family payments, the government today was forced to admit that 1½ million Australian families who receive family payments will be worse off. Why is the Prime Minister cutting the living standards of 1½ million Australian families?

        <p>
         The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: why is he threatening the jobs of every Australian? Do you want to know how many Australian families will be worse off under a government led by this man? Every single one. How many
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         ns are worse off because of the Labor left ideological approach to power? I will tell you: every single one—every single one that wants to turn the lights on, that wants to put the air conditioner on, that wants to have a job and wants to have some investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor Party threatens every job and every business. They have a set of policies, and every single one is designed to discourage investment and discourage employment. And on energy, we do not have to theorise about what their policies will do; we do not need an economic model; we have got the state of South Australia that proves their folly.

There was a preamble to the question, and I am not going to have the Manager of Opposition Business reflect on me with what he just said. I am really not. I have said before, many times, that if the opposition does not want to have preambles within their questions that is a matter for them, but I have decided to have free-flowing debate in this regard. I have said this many times before, and it was uncharacteristic of the Manager of Opposition Business that he was going to describe the Prime Minister's answer in that way and how I am ruling on them—I am not happy about that; I am really not. The Prime Minister is well within order given the question that has been asked. The Prime Minister has the call.
