        For many Australians,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        is an opportunity to relax with family and friends and enjoy what this great nation has to offer. However, it also gives us the opportunity to acknowledge special individuals whose passion, commitment and hard work in the community deserve recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Bass I am privileged to attend many of the Australia Day awards ceremonies held by local councils in my electorate. I would like to congratulate some of the individuals from Bass whose ongoing commitment and service to community was recognised with Australia Day awards this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        On January 26, I had the pleasure of attending the Australia Day Breakfast, hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        City Council. The George Town Council Australia Day Awards recognised the hard work and dedicated service to the community by many local people. In particular, I would like to congratulate the following award recipients. Citizen of the Year was Mr Roger Millar, for his many years of voluntary service to the Hillwood community. Young Citizen of the Year was Getasew Ferguson, for his very high achievements in athletics.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Event" rel="nofollow">
         The Event
        </a>
        of the Year was won jointly by Dancing in the Streets, awarded to Jill Fish from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Dalrymple_School" rel="nofollow">
         Port Dalrymple School
        </a>
        , and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of George Town for their Country Music Festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also attended the Launceston City Council Australia Day Awards and Citizenship Ceremony. It was fantastic to welcome some 60 new Australian citizens to the Launceston community and hear them affirm their loyalty to Australia and its people.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        recognized local residents who have demonstrated outstanding community service and celebrated community events with their Australia Day Awards 2013. I offer my congratulations to Citizen of the Year Rosalind Lewis, who was actually a teacher at my high school—I think it was her first year out—and Ros is still out there championing the people who are vulnerable in the local community and around the world. The Community Event of the Year was jointly won by the Encore Theatre Company and the North Launceston Bowls and Community Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also spent a great afternoon at the Meander Valley Council's Australia Day celebrations. After some top entertainment from local artists, Australia Day awards were presented and I would like to offer my congratulations to several individuals. Citizen of the Year was Mrs Edna McCormack, a fabulous worker for the whole community and a long-term volunteer at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        . Young Citizen of the Year went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Will Smith
        </a>
        . The Sports Award was awarded to Michael and Gale Claxton, who have dedicated their lives to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westbury_Cricket_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Westbury Cricket Club
        </a>
        . The Community Event of the Year went to the Tasmanian Women in Agriculture Meander Valley group for the 10th Women on Farms gathering.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also thrilled to hear about the contributions of two dedicated individuals from Bass who are recognised in the Australia Day Honours List. The Australian honours system recognises and celebrates the outstanding contribution and achievements of a diversity of Australians. Receiving an Australia Day honour is a great personal achievement and a source of pride and inspiration to our local community. Firstly, I offer my sincere congratulations to Dr Jane Zimmerman for her appointment as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her significant service to the community as an advocate and promoter of the status and health of women. I would also like to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McNeill" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander McNeill
        </a>
        for his award of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . Mr McNeill was recognised for his ongoing commitment and service to the welfare of veterans and their families. Both Dr Zimmerman and Mr McNeill are truly deserving recipients of these honours. I am delighted that their contribution and service to fellow citizens here in Australia and internationally has been recognised in such a way. Once again, I say well done to all of the Australia Day Award winners and to those included in the honours list. I thank them all sincerely for their commitment to community and to community service. I am so pleased to be able to celebrate the excellence and achievement in the Australian community by participating in these Australia Day Award ceremonies.
