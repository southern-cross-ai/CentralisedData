       <p>
        Recently, a number of constituents in my electorate of Menzies came to see me about a range of issues. Some of them are to do with climate change, renewable energy and the like, and they asked me whether I would raise their concerns in this place. One group was led by Tamara Levy and another, WarrandyteCAN, had a petition, but, as it was not in the correct form to be presented to the House and they had come to discuss the issues with me, I said that I would nonetheless raise their concerns on behalf of the 99 people, and I do that today.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a second matter, I'd like to take this opportunity, as we approach Christmas, of thanking all who serve the community in my electorate. There are so many people who, on an ongoing basis, serve others within my electorate, as they do in electorates right across Australia. I'd like to mention some of those groups today. Obviously, at this time of the year, there's often a call for emergency services at a greater level than at other times. There are the local police, the ambulance officers and drivers—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance_Victoria" rel="nofollow">

        has its headquarters based in my electorate—the

        workers and the

         CFA
        </a>
        . We hope that the CFA and the SES have a quiet Christmas and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        period, but, with the indication that we're going to have a warmer summer than usual, there's always the real chance that they will be called out to fight the bushfires that occur from time to time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to pay tribute to the many service clubs in the Menzies electorate, the Rotary and Lions clubs, who do wonderful work in terms of supporting the community by raising money and supporting various projects within the electorate. I also thank the seniors groups—the Chinese, the Italian, the Greek and the Macedonian seniors groups—who meet weekly at various places within the electorate. They bring a great sense of camaraderie to older people from their own particular ethnic backgrounds. They are very vibrant groups. In fact, they are so large in many instances that they're outgrowing the premises in which they meet and have to look for other venues. Their ongoing work for their local communities is something which should be acknowledged in this place, and I thank them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank all the workers in the aged-care homes. There are numerous aged-care homes. Day in, day out, 24/7, the care workers, the nurses and others provide support, care, comfort and love to senior citizens within the electorate of Menzies. I'd like to thank Helen Jurcevic and the Women's Friendship Group, an organisation that brings women together on a regular basis. It provides friendship for those who may not have friends to the same extent that many others do in society. This is a wonderful organisation that's been operating for a number of years within Menzies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the public transport workers. We get on a train or, as it is in my electorate, a bus, particularly over holiday periods, when we want to go from here to there or somewhere else, and we sometimes forget that there are people working at times when others are on vacation. To all the bus drivers, in particular who transport people around the electorate of Menzies, on behalf of the community, I express a very sincere thank you as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I especially mention the volunteers who work with the major welfare agency within Menzies, Doncare, which provides wonderful services. It's staffed by professionals but also a huge army of volunteers—not only the ones who operate the various op-shops that raise money for Doncare but those who provide services through Doncare itself. Many of the volunteers have been working for Doncare for decades, and I've been able to recognise some of them in the annual Menzies
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Awards, which we'll have once again on Australia Day next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In mentioning volunteers and people who work for the community, I'd like to take this opportunity to particularly mention the late Ray Lord, who passed away recently. Ray was a great worker for our community, a tireless worker for the community. He was particularly instrumental in the establishment of the Community Bank at both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doncaster_East" rel="nofollow">
         Doncaster East
        </a>
        and Templestowe. His funeral will be held next week. He was a great worker for the local community throughout his lifetime, and it's appropriate to acknowledge him here for the work that he undertook.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, to all of my constituents: I wish you a very peaceful Christmas. I wish you a happy new year, a safe new year, and a holiday period in which you can rest and be with your family and friends. Let's look forward to a wonderful 2019.
       </p>
