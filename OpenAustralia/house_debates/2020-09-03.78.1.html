        The Prime Minister turns his back on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . His WA Liberal team were happy to choose
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Palmer" rel="nofollow">
         Clive Palmer
        </a>
        over the people of WA, and now the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are doing Clive Palmer's bidding via the back door. The members for Swan, Hasluck, Stirling and the rest are undermining their own stateâ€”treason against Western Australia, they would once have said!
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister said that we need to get out from under the doona, and when it came to Clive Palmer's High Court case he used the withdrawal method! I promised my community that I would bring their voices into this place. When it comes to the WA border, here is what they have to say to the WA Liberals: Mr Schultz asked, 'Why does the Prime Minister support people like Colbeck and Palmer and turn his back on the aged?' Josh Bryson said, 'Why does he want to gamble with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        lives?' Michael Rowan said, 'This pandemic has exposed the vicious
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .'
       </p>
       <p>
        Bronwyn is much more positive; she says that she supports our Premier, Mike McGowan, and all of his team. So do I. I can't say that about those opposite. A very sensible bloke in my electorate, John, said that he has an old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it!' And Linda has the sad truth about this government, that it's 'becoming the comic relief during this pandemic'. Isn't that sad, but isn't that so true?
