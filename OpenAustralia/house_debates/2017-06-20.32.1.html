        who have been recognised in the recent Australian Honours list for the good work they do in the local community.

       <p>
        Mrs Kay Cleak from Bertram has been honoured with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her services to veterans and their families and also for her service to youth through her work with the Scouts. Mrs Cleak's dedication to these organisations has seen her take on many roles in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL

        Mr Stephen Treeby from Wandi—wonderful Wandi—this year has been awarded with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        for his service to the Mandogalup Volunteer Bush
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Brigade" rel="nofollow">
         Fire Brigade
        </a>
        . Joining the brigade in 1970, Mr Treeby has served as firefighter, captain, fire control officer and the deputy chief fire control officer. In his 47 years of service, the community has suffered a number of large bushfire emergencies. The work the brigade does and the volunteers do saves lives and saves properties across the district. Mr Treeby is a mentor for new volunteers; he has implemented gender equality in recruitment to the Fire Brigade, which has led to increased female participation in it. He has led the push for a new Mandogalup fire station and control centre, and I look forward to seeing it in operation. His tireless work for the community—
