        The amendment, although it has 30 parts, is to a single effect, which is to reinstate what we've called the 'Howard safeguard'. In other words, it would ensure that, with the consent of the Attorney-General, questioning warrants could only be issued by an independent issuing authority. Parliamentary counsel has seen it as necessary to develop a quite intricate set of amendments, but they only do the one thing: they put back an issuing authority, who will be a judge, and set up a process where the Director-General of Security, the head of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        , seeks the Attorney-General's consent and the Attorney-General then goes to the issuing authority for a warrant to be issued.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I explained in my second reading speech, the government has advanced no persuasive justification for removing the Howard safeguard from the questioning warrant framework. It's an important safeguard and it should be reinstated. The amendments circulated in my name would do precisely that. Of course Labor's preference would be for the government to move its own amendment to reinstate the Howard safeguard. We would welcome an opportunity to work with the government to that end. There's still time for government members to reconsider their position on this matter, and I would urge them to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        To be clear: if the amendments fail, Labor will reinstate the Howard safeguard, the process of having an issuing authority who is a judge, if we are successful at the next election.

         I rise to support these amendments for the reasons that the shadow Attorney-General has put forward. They're good reasons. I'm sure the shadow Attorney-General was putting them forward as a good-faith attempt to address a real problem with the bill. In doing so, the amendments nail the problem with the bill and the reason it shouldn't pass. So, while I support these amendments, I suggest to the House that if the amendments fail, the bill itself should be defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the amendments seek to do is ensure that we don't move to a situation where a minister has unfettered power and is able to issue warrants that are not supervised by an issuing authority. That would be a huge, huge step. I think it speaks volumes that the minister hasn't bothered to respond to the amendments and explain why it is that all of a sudden we should remove the role of a judge or an issuing authority. He can't bring himself to make a contribution on that front. These amendments highlight that the bill is, in effect, a big power grab to entrench in ministers powers to do things that would otherwise be unlawful—namely, bring someone in for questioning, hold them, seize them, without having to go to a judge to seek permission.
