       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts will receive approximately $4 billion, including funding for government business enterprises to continue to deliver projects, including the

        </a>
        provision of $600 million to provide the government with the capacity to allocate additional appropriations for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Since March 2020, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFM" rel="nofollow">
         AFM
        </a>
        provisions in annual appropriations acts have been set at an extraordinary level, primarily due to the unique and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2023-24 bills return the AFM provisions to conventional levels, as the Australian governments have agreed to a strategic framework to support the transition of measures and policies to a sustainable COVID-19 steady state. These measures should reduce the potential call on AFM provisions in the future, and a specific AFM provision for COVID-19 or other national emergency response is no longer required.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also sets the debit limits for payments under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 that apply in 2023-24. They are as follows: $5 billion for general purpose financial assistance and $35 billion for national partnership payments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the portfolio budget statements tabled in the parliament today. I commend the bill to this chamber.

        Debate adjourned.
