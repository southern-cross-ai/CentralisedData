        Today I would like to pay a tribute to the Camden community in my electorate and mention a couple of great things that are underway locally. Team Kermit is a fantastic initiative supporting more than 70 local families who have kids living with cancer. Team Kermit have just returned from their sixth

        car rally, raising $82,000 for the kids' cancer charity. Thanks to the commitment of people like

        , Marty Magro, Barrie Grimes and John and Wayne Gannon, Camp Quality can continue its magical work for children battling cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also doing great things in my electorate for cancer support services are the team behind Camden and Districts Rotary Relay for Life. Their September event raised a whopping $200,000 and counting. A thousand people joined in, walking a combined total of more than 6,500 kilometres around the track at Onslow Park. It was a magnificent effort by the community and the organising committee, led by Aneek Mollah, Matt Playford and Ross Newport.

        The Camden region, while experiencing tremendous growth, is still very much defined by its sense of community. That is one of its greatest assets. It is also a district fiercely proud of its history. The 7th Light Horse Regiment Menangle Historic Troop from the Camden area was formed to remember the traditions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Light Horse
        </a>
        . It was a mounted infantry regiment of the

        and the first mounted light horse cavalry unit in Australia. It was raised in October 1914 and assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. I would like to thank the regiment for recently making me an honorary trooper and patron. I thank President Leonard Carter, a direct descendant of a

        light horseman, for welcoming me to his troop of military history guardians. This is a great honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Camden region is also the toast of Hollywood right now. Bringelly, a village to the north of Camden, is providing the battle setting in Mel Gibson's latest blockbuster
        <i>
         Hacksaw Ridge
        </i>
        . I might add that Goulburn, in the heart of Hume, was a fine support act, with the cliff scenes in the movie filmed there. That is something for movie buffs to look out forâ€”and it is a terrific movie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Camden sits at the centre of much of the development around the new Western Sydney Airport. Effectively we are building a new city there. While there is change coming to the region, I know that great community spirit will remain and so will the strong sense of pride in the area's history. Camden has a tremendous past and an exciting future. It is a privilege to be serving this community as the local federal member.
