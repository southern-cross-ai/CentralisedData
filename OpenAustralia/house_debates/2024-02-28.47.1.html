       <p>
        Right now, as we stand and sit in this House, there are many volunteers in Victoria fighting fires. I want to take a moment to pay tribute to all of those volunteers. To anyone listening at home: please listen to emergency services. What's amazing about our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        volunteers in Victoria is that these fires are in western Victoria, hours and hours and hundreds of kilometres away from my community, but I know that many of the CFA volunteers from my community are fighting those fires to keep western Victoria safe. I want to pay tribute to all of them.
       </p>

        There are also many strike forces that are at their stations ready to go if they are needed today. Hopefully they are not needed. It's important we pay tribute to these volunteers. There is no direct benefit to the volunteers of Casey who are going to western Victoria, but they are there to help their fellow Victorians. They also know that, if we're in trouble in our electorate, people will come from all across Victoria and all across Australia to help us with our bushfire risk, if that comes and is required. That is the true Australian spiritâ€”volunteers giving up their time to support their community and to support others. I pay tribute today to all the volunteers who are giving up so much for our community. Stay safe, protect what you can and please make sure you get home to your loved ones.
