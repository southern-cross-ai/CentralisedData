        Our first responders are out there every day, leaving their loved ones to go and support their community through its time of greatest need. We talk a lot in this place about mental health support for defence members and veterans—and rightly so—but the same can't always be said for those who serve in our emergency services. That's where Fortem comes in. Fortem is a not-for-profit organisation that supports the mental health and wellbeing of first responders—the people who protect and care for Australian communities. Fortem has recognised the gap in support services and is filling that gap.

        In Townsville we're the biggest city that is furthest away from a capital city, which is why Fortem decided to set up shop in our city. But it nearly didn't happen, as the Albanese Labor government threatened to pull the former coalition government's commitment of $10 million in funding for Fortem. We took up that fight last year and the government backflipped and now an office and personnel being on the ground in Townsville are just months away.

        Last week we marked Thank a First Responder Day as a nation, a day to show our support to those who dedicate their lives to protecting us and keeping us safe. It was great to join James from Fortem along with the opposition leader and local first responders for a thankyou barbecue held at

        and Emergency Services' regional headquarters. I look forward to working closely with this great organisation as it supports those who support us.
