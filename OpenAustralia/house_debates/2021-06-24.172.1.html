        I am actively working to attract more technologically advanced industries to the

         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        to collaborate with the institutions within the Joondalup Learning Precinct and provide more opportunities to work locally for our highly skilled workforce. I recently met with Paul Lucy, who briefed me about 'Project Joondalup', which is a blueprint for Joondalup to become a focus centre for urban and service robotics by 2032. This includes creating a world-class education hub and an active ecosystem that supports emerging businesses and global organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project has the potential to significantly grow the City of Joondalup's economy over the next decade. Several challenges and opportunities exist to achieve these goals, so a road map is required for the City of Joondalup and various stakeholders. Key amongst these challenges is the need to advocate for regulatory reform for autonomous vehicles, build an ecosystem that attracts talent from the education sector into starting businesses locally, and build a closer relationship between the city and the education precinct that develops Joondalup into a true university city. The focus areas include automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity in the resources, medical, manufacturing and transport industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        To fully realise the value of building a supply chain around automation and robotics in the resource sector, there needs to be a secondary industry to diversify the supply chain. The automotive industry, through the future of mobility, is now the driving force in robotic mobility. Large companies are more likely to locate, invest, and have a presence in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        if they can service both the resource sector and the future of mobility. The value of the future-of-mobility sector in terms of autonomous and robotic input is around $3 billion today, growing to $20 billion by 2030, just for Australia. By creating a collaborative robotics precinct in Joondalup, this will support the resource sector and provide a more attractive environment to attract large firms who also have a focus on urban robotics. Urban robotics is a natural fit for the resource sector as a base technology. It is largely compatible and interchangeable. This makes the step-change from firms applying technology locally, to the resource sector, to building technology locally for multiple sectors.
