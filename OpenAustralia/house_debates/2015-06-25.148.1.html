       <p>
        Last Friday I attended the 25th birthday party of Eastlakes Legacy at Swansea
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        . Eastlakes Legacy is a group of senior women who have made enormous contributions within their group. They provide support for each other. During that birthday party, we reminisced about our long-term relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember attending one of their first birthday parties held down at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caves_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Caves Beach
        </a>
        : all the women sat together and we had a picnic lunch. Those same women are a little older now and there are fewer of them involved in the group than there were back then, but they are still there for each other. The oldest member of the group, Mavis Kanaar, is 95 and looking forward to the celebration of her 100th birthday. Last year she received one of the Shortland Awards for her work as a volunteer. She is an outstanding woman.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to that, tribute was paid to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Hughes" rel="nofollow">
         June Hughes
        </a>
        , who has retired as president. June has been involved with Eastlakes Legacy widows for 19 years. She has provided enormous service to the group and support to many widows over that period of time. Unfortunately, June now has very poor eyesight and quite a few health problems, so instead of being the leader of the group she is now a member of the group and getting support from all of the other members of Eastlakes Legacy. An award was given to her on the day, and she was given flowers and chocolates and everyone expressed their appreciation for her contribution to the group.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new president is Marie Pyne. She is a vibrant lady who is looking forward to taking over where June left off. I know that Eastlakes Legacy widows will be in good hands under her leadership. Noelene Seaborne will continue in the role of secretary and continue to do the fantastic job that she has been doing so many years. I congratulate Eastlakes Legacy widows on the fine work that they have done in supporting each other, and I look forward to attending their 26th birthday party next year as well as catching up with them at Christmas time.
