       <p>
        Recently I visited the Port Milang Historic Railway Museum, which is managed by a group of volunteers who are keen to share the rich history of Milang and promote tourism in the region. During my visit I saw visitors of all ages and backgrounds, and they were enjoying the museum. They were exploring the fantastic railway memorabilia, playing with model trains—even very elderly people; we all love our model trains—and also driving a train through a simulator. I had some fun there. After, I had Devonshire tea and scones in the tearoom.

        As part of the visit I got to experience a ride in an old munitions wagon which has been converted to a passenger vehicle. The museum has offered free rides in this vehicle once a month since August last year. The train ride has proved to be very popular, with the current record being 36 trips in one day. The museum is hoping to extend this service to operate every Sunday, as it serves as the highlight for many visitors. The locomotive is currently powered by 24 two-volt batteries. They're over two decades old and are badly needing to be upgraded. My office is working with the museum to source funding to keep this valuable asset running. So if you find yourself in Mayo—and I say this to all the people in the House—please pay a visit to the Port Milang Historic Railway Museum. It's a visit you won't be disappointed in. It's a wonderful day. Take the family, take a picnic—
