        I would like to share with the House some of the lyrics from local musician and rap artist Nathan Tessman. These are his words from

       <p class="italic">
        Some days in my life wanted to spread my wings and fly away
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Leave my problems never return never come back in a couple days
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Try release all the pain that I keep bottled up inside
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's switch body's see what life's like through each others eyes
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I must admit at my school I wasn't the coolest kid in the class
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Around tenth grade got hit by depression and man it came fast
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Never thought it would past never thought it would stay for so long
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Made me feel like I didn't belong always felt like the outcast
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In my family felt like a failure all because of my disability
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I cried myself asleep every night thinking this was so unfair
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a young kid I always thought my disease would go away
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And I could stand and walk like everyone else but was so unaware
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That it wouldn't and I was stuck with this condition permanently
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You have know idea how this makes me feel to get of my chest
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cause when your depressed you really do [feel] like your body has been possessed
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Then your stressed then you think life just becomes a test
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To escape all this mess you only think suicide's the guest
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I know my body looked in pain but my whole mental state was painful
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And I thought to myself were the hell is my guardian angel
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now I'm great-full that he found me all I can say is I'm so thankful
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That you turned my life around and made me feel like I'm not disable
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now you know my story and all the pain I faced everyday

        Nathan is a 20-year-old with axonal neuropathy. He is an inspiration to his family and his community, and I am very delighted to be able to read his words in this House.
