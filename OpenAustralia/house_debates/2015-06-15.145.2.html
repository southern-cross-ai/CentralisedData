        I rise this morning to express my deep disappointment and to condemn the Abbott government on its decision not to reverse its funding cuts to Blacktown Community Aid and Holroyd Community Aid. Just days before Christmas last year, the Abbott government cut funding to these organisations, forcing them to close their doors. At the time, this was condemned by the community with many voicing their outrage at the government's petty and short-sighted decision. You only have to look at the work that Blacktown Community Aid and Holroyd Community Aid did to realise how important they were. Blacktown Community Aid had operated for 41 years. It had worked with victims of domestic violence, the homeless and other vulnerable and disadvantaged people in Blacktown, offering services such as emergency relief and electricity and food vouchers. The centre serviced up to 60 clients each week. You only have to do the maths to know how many people throughout Blacktown had been assisted by this wonderful organisation over 41 years. It was very disappointing to read that Coordinator Corine Raymond received this news only three days before Christmas and that, as she said, the department refused to give a reason for why the funding was cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        After meeting with Blacktown Community Aid earlier this year, I wanted to make sure that we got to the point where we could not say that we had not done everything possible to keep them open. I respectfully wrote to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        in March and invited him to reconsider this decision, offering to arrange a visit to Blacktown Community Aid to see first-hand the work they do and so that he could meet volunteers. It is now the middle of June. I am happy to stand corrected but I have still not received a response from the minister or his office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week the minister announced that the government will reverse its cuts to 100 community organisations around the country 'to address gaps in frontline community services'. Holroyd Community Aid and Blacktown Community Aid did not receive such funding. I can tell you there will be enormous gaps in these two local government areas as a result of their demise. In his media release on the announcement, the minister thanked his parliamentary colleagues for bringing these gaps to his attention and said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Their representations have been a critical part of this process to ensure that services will continue to be there for those who need them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blacktown Community Aid had been serving the local community I represent for over 40 years. It had worked tirelessly on a shoestring budget with considerable volunteer input and community support, but according to this government, Blacktown Community Aid should be shut down after such outstanding service. This is an utter disgrace. It highlights everything that is wrong with this governmentâ€”petty, short-sighted and unfair, from an unfair government. I condemn this decision. It will have an ongoing, detrimental impact on those that are the most vulnerable in our community. I repeat my thanks to everyone who has worked with Blacktown Community Aid and Holroyd Community Aid for the difference you have made in our society.
