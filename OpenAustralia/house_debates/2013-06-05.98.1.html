        My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Why is it important to deliver real and fair tax reform for all Australians? What would be the impact on communities of other approaches?

         I thank the member for Bass for his question. This government has been delivering real tax reform to ensure that hardworking Australian families and small businesses are able to get a fair share and a fair go. On top of three rounds of tax cuts that we have delivered since 2008 we have tripled the tax-free threshold, we have introduced the instant asset write-off for small businesses and now are interesting loss carry-back, and we have also cut taxes on superannuation for the lowest paid of our workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every single one of these measures has been opposed by those opposite, and I am not surprised because, when it comes to tax reform, those opposite think that tax reform is a three-letter word. It is '
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         '. GST is what is in their
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
          DNA
         </a>
         . They were the ones who introduced it. We know they always wanted to put it on everything and, if they get half a chance, they will come back and try to do the same again. We are against that because we know any plan to increase the GST will smash families, smash pensioners and tie businesses—in particular small businesses—up with even more red tape.
        </p>
        <p>
         But don't take my word for it; listen to what their Liberal state premier family out there calling for an increase in the GST are saying. Look at what Premier O'Farrell has had to say. He says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All options should be on the table, broadening the base, looking at the rate and also the rebates back to the states.
        </p>
        <p>
         And it is not just the Liberal state premiers. Go have a look at the mentors of the Leader of the Opposition—

          <p>
           But it is not just the old guard. We know the member for Mayo supports jacking up the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
            GST
           </a>
           . The member for Stirling was out there recently saying it should be on the table. Just yesterday we heard from the former WA Treasurer and the soon-to-be Liberal candidate for Pearce, and he was out there saying we should jack up the GST as well. Not only was he saying that; he said, 'We need to rip money away from states like Tasmania and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           to pay for it.' That is what they believe in.
          </p>
          <p>
           So we have this chorus of conservatives out there all calling for an increase in the GST, and what do we hear from the Leader of the Opposition? All we get from the Leader of the Opposition is, 'I won't rule that out.' Of course he will not rule it out. He will not rule it out, because that is exactly what he intends to do. He says he wants a GST review. We all know the tax review he calls for will be a GST review. It will be a vehicle to jack up the GST. We are a government that will stand up against the Liberal state premiers. The coalition, on the other hand, introduced it. It is in their

           , and they are just champing at the bit, hoping to get an opportunity to come back and finish the job.
