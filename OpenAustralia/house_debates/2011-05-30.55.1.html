        A number of constituents have contacted my office to complain about the poor quality digital

        </a>
        reception experienced in the Mandurah area and in Waroona. Problems include audio drop-out, spikes, pixelations across the screen and loud and intermittent electronic noises. Residents have been told that this may be a result of faulty electronic items in surrounding premises. However, the

        </a>
        , his office advised that the residents should point their aerials in the right direction or have a technician inspect the problem. Many of these constituents have come to my office after they have paid for qualified technicians to come to their homes to inspect the problems, and even replace the entire antenna. Many have also contacted ACMA directly, to no avail. The Minister has also suggested that some of the residents may be eligible to move to digital TV via satellite, or
