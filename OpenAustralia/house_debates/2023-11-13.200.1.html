        We all know on this side, as a government, how difficult it is right now for people to just get byâ€”to just pay the basic bills. That's why we're absolutely focused on doing what we can to relieve that pressure. This includes investing billions of dollars into Australian homes and small businesses, because we know the cost of living is taking its toll on Australians.

We are doing this because we care. We want to ensure that, no matter who you are or where you come from, you get a fair go. That's what
