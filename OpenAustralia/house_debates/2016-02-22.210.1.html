        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate two of Forde's biggest small business identities, Barry and Jenny Lane, for their hard work and commitment to providing training and development opportunities for their

        employees. Barry and Jenny are passionate about making a positive contribution to the local hospitality industry. They run four Coffee Club stores, with their four daughters, at Springwood,

        , Meadowbrook and Loganholme.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 14 years the family has operated in Logan they have gained numerous industry accolades. Most recently, all four stores have gained national recognition for a new learning and development program that allows their team members to earn certificates and diplomas in hospitality, on the job, while they are working. This new and innovative learning and development program was awarded Training Initiative of the Year at the recent

        Media Awards, and I would like to congratulate the Lane family on this outstanding achievement. This industry-first program has enabled the Lane family to invest in the professional development of their staff and allows them to recognise and reward their staff by supporting their career aspirations with industry-recognised certifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this learning and development program the Lane family have a number of staff well on their way to becoming qualified chefs and hospitality professionals. Well done to the Lane family on supporting local jobs and training opportunities.
