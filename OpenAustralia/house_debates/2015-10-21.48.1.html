       <p>
        There is great news for the people of Dunkley:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        will be available to all of our premises by the end of 2017. That is such exciting news, because under the Labor rollout it would have taken a decade longer and tens of billions of dollars more. The recently announced rollout strategy sees our community's desperate need to get access to this technology and it will be able to be serviced by the end of 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few things have changed. Many people might not realise that taxpayers funded those thick black cables that carry pay
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        and that they were going to be buried in the tip. What is the point of that? The new approach of nbn co to use the most appropriate and available technology will see that pay-TV infrastructure enhanced with some Swiss software to become the backbone of NBN service delivery to large parts of my electorate, particularly in the city of Frankston.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is also good news is that nbn co have realised that there is little point overbuilding areas where there is already existing infrastructure while other parts of our community are crying out for broadband at a speed that can support their business, education and use of this technology. Mornington, the great community where I live, is groaning under the growth pressures of people wanting to be a part of our great community. Its rollout has been accelerated as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank Telstra. They have engaged constructively around the Seabrook Way and Manor Drive area. The NBN is some time off. There is a business case for Telstra to invest. They look like they are going to do so. It is a network of networks and a big win for Dunkley.
