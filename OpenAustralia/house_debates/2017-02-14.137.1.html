        Bounty Boulevard State School is represented by some 48 different nationalities in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         North Lakes
        </a>
        area, one of the fastest growing areas in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay
        </a>
        region. The school itself has almost 1,400 students and is the largest primary school in Queensland. It is tasked with educating the children of North Lakes, a suburb that in 2011 had 19,000 people and today has 30,000 people.
       </p>

        Bounty Boulevard State School, like other schools around the nation, has just welcomed its new leaders. I was fortunate to be at the school's badging ceremony on 3 February to usher in young Aneka Knott and Samuel Savage as the 2017 Bounty Boulevard State School captains. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate both Aneka and Samuel and to thank them. They are an impressive pair, and I can confidently say that Queensland's largest state school will do well in their capable but small hands. There are other great leaders there as well: the vice-captains, the school leaders, the house captains and all the year 6s who will play a leadership role this year, as well as all the teaching staff and the principal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The badging ceremony was a wonderful event. I think the only way that it could have possibly been better is if the whole school could have shared the occasion under the one roof. I know from my long-running discussions with the school community that most parents would likely agree. At present the school has no undercover space which can hold a full school assembly—from grade P to 6 as well as teaching staff and other staff and parents—an Anzac Day ceremony, a presentation or a graduation. There is nothing at the moment for Queensland's largest state school.
       </p>

        The school's P&amp;C is especially active. It does a sterling job and has led the push to secure funding for the much-needed school hall. But you do need to sell a lot of lamingtons to raise enough money for a school hall, and they certainly could use a helping hand. A petition attracted some 800 signatures and was referred to Queensland's education minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Jones" rel="nofollow">

        , last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have written twice to the state education minister, Kate Jones, advocating and pleading with the state Labor government to fund a school hall for Bounty Boulevard State School and had two replies: one on 10 May and one on 7 December last year. All that Ms Jones could do was blame her predecessor, but Ms Jones knows too well that the federal coalition government has committed $1.1 billion in additional funds this year alone to state schools. What I need her to do is kick the can and fund the hall. In the lead-up to this year's state election, I call on both sides to fund it urgently.
