        The honour board at the Pakenham Fire Brigade reads, 'Whilst we have time, let us do good to all men,' Galatians 6:10. I was pleased to attend, as a family member, the Pakenham Life Members presentation day and dedication of the bell. It was ably emceed by Jim Dore and Wayne Nutting and attended by Trevor Owen, assistant chief officer for the south eastern regions. There was a presentation to Lisa Hicks for service to the fire brigade.

        service awards were presented to Kylie Shanks and

        , and outstanding service awards were presented to Bruce Wicks and Charlie Lansdown. But the presentation of new life members was the highlight for Jean Kelsey, Rob Golding, Ann Ramsdale and Aunty Norma Jackson—of course, relations of mine, and not only relations but friends. I was not attending there as the federal member of parliament; I was only included as my wife's partner, but I was asked to respond at the end on behalf of the community.

        Norma Jackson is in her 90s, and she regaled the great stories of the past of the Pakenham Fire Brigade and all that have gone with it. These people—Jean Kelsey, Rob Golding, Ann Ramsdale and Norma Jackson—will be great additions to the honour board. Whilst we have time, let us do good to all men.
