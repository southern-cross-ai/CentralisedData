        My question is to the Prime Minister. It is reported today that the member for Warringah has said there was 'no way on God's earth' he would have allowed eight-shot Adler guns to flood into the country when he was Prime Minister. So what position is the current Prime Minister taking to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">

        on Friday? What position does the Prime Minister want the states to arrive at? Does the Prime Minister want these weapons to come into Australia?

            to impose the 12-month ban on the importation of lever action shotguns of more than five rounds. That was a decision of his government and it was the right decision. And when that ban was coming to its conclusion because the state and territory police ministers had not come to agreement on how to reclassify these lever action shotguns we extended the ban. We did so for precisely the same reasons the Abbott government imposed it, and that was because we are not prepared to see those guns imported into Australia under the current classification which they have under John Howard's gun laws. The reality is that the gun laws must be strengthened as they apply to lever action shotguns. To this date, despite our best efforts, the states and territories have not agreed on the way in which these guns should be reclassified, and until they do they will not be imported. Full stop. That is our position.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turning to national security: what we have is an opposition that has not only refused to support the introduction of mandatory sentences for gun smuggling. Imagine that. They say this is an issue of principle. What is the principle involved? We say the principle is: keep Australians safe. We say the principle is: stop the illegal guns. We say the principle is: our first duty is to stop guns being smuggled into this country and ensure that guns are not used in acts of violence against citizens. What we have seen is an opposition that is not prepared to play its part in keeping Australians safe.
