       <p>
        Firstly, Deputy Speaker Coulton, may I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to your new role. I am sure you will bring to the role a very healthy dose of common sense and good humour and the personal integrity that you have demonstrated in your nine years as the member for Parkes. I sincerely wish you well in your new role in the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now be read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 1) 2016-2017, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2016-2017 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2016-2017 form the principal bills underpinning the Government's Budget. Together with the supply acts passed by the parliament earlier this year, these bills provide appropriations for the full year of 2016-17.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bills are substantively the same as the bills of the same names that were introduced into the previous parliament in May this year. Minor changes have been made to reflect only new administrative arrangements and machinery of government changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2016-2017 seeks authority for meeting the expenses of the ordinary annual services of the government for 2016-17.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just over $49 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions in the bill seek authority for appropriations broadly equivalent to 7/12ths of the estimated 2016-17 annual appropriations, plus budget measures. Together with Supply Act (No. 1) 2016-2017, this bill provides appropriations for the ordinary annual services of government for the full year of 2016-17.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline four significant items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, just under $18 billion is proposed for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        to keep our nation safe and pursue our national interests. This includes just over $615 million in 2016-17 for military operations Okra, Accordion, Highroad, Resolute and Manitou.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        would receive just under $1.3 billion. This includes funding to support the skills and training system; enhance Australia's science and research capacity; support families with flexible, accessible and affordable child care; and support the sustainable development of Australia's international education and research engagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development would receive just under $781 million in funding for 201617. This includes funding to support the Infrastructure Investment Program; support for transport programs, which includes the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme; grants to promote stable, secure and viable local and regional economies; and support for the Indian Ocean Territories and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Norfolk Island
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Fourth, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Broadcasting Corporation
        </a>
        would receive just over $610 million in 2016-17 and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Broadcasting_Service_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Special Broadcasting Service Corporation
        </a>
        would receive just over $168 million in 2016-17 to continue to provide television, radio and online services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill and the portfolio budget statements previously tabled in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
