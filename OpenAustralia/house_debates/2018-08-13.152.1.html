        In today's society it is rare that any business can reach 100 years of age, but that is exactly what the Harris Cycle Co. of Lismore has done this year, celebrating its 100th birthday. The Harris Cycle Co. was opened in 1918, owned by Harold Wotherspoon and Cecil Harris. The shop is still located in the original spot at 85 Keen Street. Darryl Pursey has worked in the shop for 33 years, with 27 of those years as the owner. He bought the business from his father-in-law and son of one of the founders, Si Wotherspoon. Darryl has put the longevity of the business down to old-fashioned service and making sure he and his staff look after their customers, many of whom are second- and third-generation customers. Darryl's mechanic Darren Spears does a fantastic job in both sales and repairs.

        Darryl has competed in both road and mountain bike competitions in the past, but most of his time now is spent developing mountain bike trails so that families can ride in safer conditions compared with being on the road. He also mentors many young riders and supports the juniors in many ways. His volunteer work with the

        Helen Trustum is a living legend in our region and, when you look at the achievements of her life, you can understand why. Helen grew up in the Coraki area. After marrying Allan, and with sons Richie and Rodney, the family moved to Bentley and established the Bentley Downs Charolais stud. In 1980, Helen picked up a pen and has been writing the history of the Northern Rivers ever since. Her first book was a history of the Trustum family, and it was then followed by othersâ€”

        ,

        </i>
        , just to name a few. In total, she has written 10 books on the history of the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helen's other achievements include the 1985 Australia Day Citizen of the Year and the 1986 Advance Australia Helpful Citizen Award for the Casino Hospital centenary. In 1998, she became the first woman in Australia to be awarded life member of the Charolais Society. She's also a life member of the Casino Show Society and a full member of the Richmond River Historical Society. For many years, she has also been the coordinator of the Bentley Art Prize, which gives local and young artists a place to showcase their work. Thank you, Helen. And, yes, you are a living legend.
