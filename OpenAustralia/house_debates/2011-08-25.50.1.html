       <p>
        I rise to congratulate Tasmania's Community Potential Foundation Limited, which is part of the Tasmania-wide organisation the O Group. The Community Potential Foundation has been awarded a $100,000 grant to provide advisory services to local businesses in the north-east of Tasmania in that great electorate of Bass that have been affected by recent floods. I recently joined the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Senator Sherry, to launch the project. The funding was made under the Australian government's Small Business Advisory Services natural disasters program to help local businesses hit by recent natural disasters. The funding is great news for the north-east of Tasmania and especially to small businesses in the Scottsdale, Branxholm, Winnaleah, Ledgerwood, Ringarooma, Gladstone, Bridport and Derby areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Community Potential Foundation Limited will be able to provide one-on-one mentoring for small businesses directly and indirectly affected by the natural disaster. Services that will be provided include business recovery planning and mentoring advice on marketing, business planning and financial issues. All services are provided free or at low cost by a small-business consultant with assistance from specialist industry professionals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our small local businesses are a vital cog in the success of a community, creating jobs and helping local economies grow. Through the small business advisory services natural disaster assistance funding, they will be able to get the right advice to help them back on their feet.
