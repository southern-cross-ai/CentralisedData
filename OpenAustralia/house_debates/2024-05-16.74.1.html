        The Albanese government is investing heavily in regional Australia. Just look at the level of investment in my electorate of Corangamite alone. Whether it is road, rail, health, education, women's advancement, communications or the environment and climate change, we are strengthening our regions, delivering cost-of-living help for local families and securing our transition to net zero emissions.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the third Labor budget in a row, our government is funding significant, much-needed projects across my region, including: almost $40 million of new funding for the

         This week was the week that the Albanese government decided to bring down a budget they tried to frame as being for easing the cost of living for Australians, yet today what they did in this House was pass legislation to introduce a new tax on everyday Australian families. On one hand they claim they want to ease the pressure but on the other they are making everyday struggling families pay more to purchase the cars they not just need but also the cars they love, and they did so in a fashion today that went to their new modus operandi, one that has existed now for two years—that is, lacking complete transparency. They closed down debate in this chamber on the very bill they put through. So not only are they prepared to introduce new taxes for Australians in the same week that they claim they are trying to look after people's cost-of-living pressures, but they do so in a way that completely lacks any transparency. They have not produced the modelling of the impact it would have on the Australian consumer and Australian families, yet they are prepared to legislate for new taxes in the very week they claim to actually care about people's cost-of-living pressures.

          It has been a big week, where the Treasurer has handed down the second surplus in as many years—something those opposite couldn't do in the three long, dreary, miserable terms that they had in government. They didn't do it under
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
           Tony Abbott
          </a>
          . They didn't do it under
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
           Malcolm Turnbull
          </a>
          . They didn't deliver a surplus under
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
           Scott Morrison
          </a>
          . But our Treasurer—he's walking triumphantly into the chamber now—has been able to deliver a couple of surpluses. It is a reflection of the prudent fiscal management of the government.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are serious cost-of-living pressures facing Australians. That's why each and every Australian worker will get a tax return and a tax reduction under this government. Unlike those opposite who wanted to only give it to certain higher income earners, we're going to make sure that every single Australian taxpayer keeps more of what they earn.
         </p>
         <p>
          It's really important that we're also going to give every single household a $300 reduction in their energy power prices, and also small businesses. You would think that would have the universal support of every single member in this House. Apparently, those opposite want to oppose the $300 reduction in power prices, which I say is a fantastic approach by those opposite. I hope they run a massive campaign on their opposition to the $300 reduction in power prices. In fact, I encourage them to do so in Macnamara.
         </p>
         <p>
          We will continue to manage the budget in a responsible way and give cost-of-living support to Australians who need it.
