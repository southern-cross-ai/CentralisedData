        Ben Auckram is a local boy who is in year 7 at

         Trinity Catholic College
        </a>
        in Lismore. Ben has spina bifida, resulting in him spending most of his young life in a wheelchair, and he has never really participated in sports, due to his disability. Fifteen months ago, Ben, along with his parents, made a life-changing decision which would benefit his health and increase muscle tone in his body. The decision was to take up swimming. It was at that time he joined the Lismore Workers Swim Team, and since then there has been no holding him back. Ben trains four afternoons a week with his local coach,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Harvey" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , as well as competing in swim meets most weekends at various levels. His most recent success was at a national competition in Brisbane which was held in April, at which Ben broke the Australian record for his event. The event was 400 metres freestyle, 13 years S7 multiclass swimmers. Ben's parents, Keron and Tony, as well as big brother, Jack, are Ben's biggest supporters, and they could not be prouder. Congratulations, Ben, you are an inspiration.

        On 5 June a much loved, valued and respected member of our community, Jenny Hankinson, passed away unexpectedly. Throughout her life, Jenny was a dedicated emergency services volunteer who contributed much to our community. Jenny had an unwavering devotion to the Rural Fire Service and passed away alongside her

        paramedics and hospital teams, Jenny could not be saved. Jenny's daughter Laurel praised the extraordinary efforts of her mother's crew. She said that, if it were not for them, doctors could not have saved Jenny's organs, which are now providing life and hope to at least five other families. Even in death, Jenny is still giving to benefit others, and she would have wanted nothing else. Jenny is also the mother-in-law of Laurel and Kevin and Chris and Fiona and a devoted 'Jen' to Matthew. She will be sadly missed by many friends and colleagues. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Jenny's family, friends and fellow RFS membersâ€”in particular, the
