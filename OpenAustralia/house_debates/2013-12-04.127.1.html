       <p>
        It is my pleasure to pay tribute to a great community builder from the town of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Evelyn
        </a>
        in the electorate of Casey. I speak of Betty Crittenden, someone who has served that Mount Evelyn community, and the Mount Evelyn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        in particular, with distinction over 28 years. I was pleased and honoured to be able to share in a recognition of her service just a couple of weekends back, on Saturday 16 November. The Mount Evelyn RSL hosted a presentation of an award for her to recognise all she has done for the RSL over 28 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Betty Crittenden has been a feature of the Mount Evelyn community every Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        , selling countless badges and poppies. She has also, over the years, been very active not only in general fundraising for the welfare of members but also in helping the club move from a shared facility to its own rooms some years ago. That meant raising a lot of money to start the move and to pay off the loan. Her drive, determination and effervescence were a true inspiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Betty's two husbands, who have passed away, were both active members of the Mount Evelyn RSL. She served with so much effort and care for the welfare of the members and the community. She herself would say that that RSL building is her second home, and she treated it as her home. It was great that she was able to be there to be presented with the official award in front of quite a large crowd and officials from the RSL. I want to pay tribute to Roger Boness, the President of the Mount Evelyn RSL, and Anthony McAleer for organising the event. It was great to see Betty there with her children, her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren on the Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        People like Betty Crittenden are critical to the development of community. For the Mount Evelyn community, Betty has done so much. It is not just the work she has done; it is not just the dollars she has raised. People like Betty Crittenden set an example for others. They build the cycle of community. Her footsteps will be followed by others who have seen the great work that she has done. She has strengthened the fabric of the Mount Evelyn community in so many ways. I pay tribute to her for everything that she has done in the last 28 years and I pay tribute to the Mount Evelyn RSL for everything that they do in the community.
