        As you would know, Deputy Speaker Georganas, on Tuesday, 4 September the Marshall Liberal government handed down the Liberal Party's very first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        n budget for 16 years. Sixteen years is a long time in the wilderness, and you would have thought that they had learnt a thing or two, but this was a budget made up of cuts, closures and privatisations. Just today, we see the state's prisons locked down because of the threat of privatisation of the

        . We could talk about their cuts to health, where the effects will be seen in our electorates in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also the budget that announced the closure of seven
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        campuses. The Marshall Liberal government want to shut down the

        , adjacent to my electorate, teaches aviation maintenance courses. It would seem to be a good place to teach those courses. Of course, if those courses aren't picked up then those TAFE students, or anybody who wants to study that important skill, will have to move interstate to continue their studies.
       </p>
       <p>
        So we've seen the short-sighted closure of seven different TAFE campuses around the state. It is primarily an assault on the job opportunities of young people and people who may have been made redundant as part of the automotive closures, or something like that, who are seeking to and need to upgrade their skills. This is the reaction from the state Liberal government: closure of TAFEs, closure of courses and closure of opportunitiesâ€”closure of employment opportunities in particular.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harvey" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Harvey
        </a>
        in Newland should be bashing down Steven Marshall's door and trying to get him to reverse these cuts and closures. If they can't do that then they're going to be held accountable. They're going to be held accountable in the northern suburbs, and they're going to be held accountable in the north-eastern suburbs. There's an opportunity at the next federal election to send those members a very clear message, not just about federal politics but about the state Liberal budget. It is a budget that has TAFE closures in their local areas, with the closure of skills, the closure of job opportunities and the closure of progress in our state.
