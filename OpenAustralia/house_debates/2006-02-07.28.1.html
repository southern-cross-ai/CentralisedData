He was asking his question. The Leader of the Opposition is not entitled to move that in this way at this time.

                I was on my feet here at the dispatch box when the Prime Minister answered you that he had finished his answer. Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, just whipping your eyes across there will not do. The government has a pretty thoroughgoing understanding that they have got to cop a resolution on this given their shabby behaviour.

                  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is your sole prerogative as to who you give the call to. It is true that you gave the call to the member for Kingston, but you withdrew it and called the Leader of the Opposition. I cannot see how—

                   I will rule on that point. The only way under the standing orders that the Leader of the Opposition could interrupt the question was to take a point of order. I gave him the call, thinking he was going to take a point of order. He wanted to move a motion. In that case the member for Kingston still has the right to ask his question, so I call the member for Kingston.

                     I thank the member for Kingston, because he is one of the strong advocates in this place on the government side for Australian technical colleges. Of the 19 successful proposals announced so far in the 18 of the 24 regions the government promised, one is in the

                     area. We are sure to make further announcements on at least two other regions in coming days. The government is spending $343.6 million over five years on this. Five are starting this year. In fact, four have already opened their doors in places such as eastern Melbourne, Gladstone, the

                      Those opposite are calling out ‘four’—yes, that is four colleges; the Labor Party promised zero. At the end of it, this government’s commitment to vocational and technical education has seen funding increase by 88.3 per cent since 1996. In real terms, that is a record $2.5 billion this financial year compared to the measly $1.07 billion in 1995. The number of new apprentices in training has increased by 172 per cent, from 143,795 in 1995 to 391,200 as at the end of June last year. The member for Kingston will be interested to know that in his electorate 74 apprentices are eligible today for the Tools for your Trade initiative. The member for Brand would probably want to know—because he says he does not know of any—there are 218 in his electorate. In the member for Kingston’s electorate there has been a 367 per cent increase in the number of apprentices in training since 1996.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This is evidence that the Australian business community, who are the ones who create apprenticeships, are driving the economy further by taking that investment and are making certain that Australia’s future and the future strength of our economy is assured by this investment in training.

                        The number of students altogether in vocational and technical education around this country today has risen to 1.6 million people, and that is an increase of 26 per cent over the last few years. At the end of the day, never before in the history of this nation has there been a government with this level of commitment to this important area of encouraging businesses to take on young people in particular, to give them the training opportunities to take on the nation building trades. This is a big contrast to the days when the member for Brand was the minister in charge of this particular area. In fact, I suppose the Minister for Defence will probably like the irony of this. When the member for Brand went from Defence to education and training, he said that there were no challenges left. He felt as though there was nothing to do, and in his time in that particular job there were 30,000 people trashed when it came to apprenticeships in this country, and Australia’s economy is still paying the price for the lack of interest that the member for Brand had when he had an opportunity to grow apprenticeships. Instead he retarded it, and it affected Australia’s economy. The recession we had to have is still being felt right around Australia today because of the member for Brand’s stewardship at that time.
