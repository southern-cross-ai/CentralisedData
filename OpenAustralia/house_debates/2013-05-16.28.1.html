The Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, Brisbane, is one of the Australian Defence Force's major bases and home to units of the 7th and 11th Brigades, as well as the headquarters of the 1st Division and 16th Aviation Brigade. The on-base facilities are currently undergoing a major expansion. In conjunction with this on-base expansion,

         DHA

        has identified a need over the next five years to provide additional housing accommodation for families of defence personnel working in the Brisbane area.

       <p>
        The Warner site is a 35.71 hectare greenfield parcel of land at the corner of Kremzow Road and

         Old North Road

        , Warner, located approximately 20 kilometres north of the Brisbane central business district. DHA proposes to develop approximately 465 allotments for the provision of developed land and housing to assist in satisfying future demand. Housing for defence families will be constructed on 130 lots over three years with the remaining 335 residential lots to be sold to the general market.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated overall cost of the project is $91.3 million, including

       </p>
       <p>
        Defence Housing Australia proposes to undertake redevelopment and construction of housing for the Department of Defence at Samford Road, Enoggera, Brisbane. I might add that DHA has undertaken a massive investment in the Brisbane and Ipswich regions in the past few years as a result of the expansion of the military bases located in Brisbane and at Amberley in Ipswich. This has been a major boost for South-East Queensland, particularly in relation to construction and tradesmen. It has also brought in a massive amount of money into South-East Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is proposed to demolish the current seven two-storey brick and weatherboard townhouses that are outdated and do not meet Defence guidelines. The current townhouses will be replaced by seven new townhouses and 48 apartments, all of which are to be occupied by Defence members and their families. This opportunity to redevelop an existing DHA owned site will meet the dual goals of greater housing choice and a reduction in rent allowance in a location where the majority of commuting by both the members and their families can be by walking or accessing public transport. The estimated overall cost of the project is $24.6 million including GST and escalation costs, but excluding the cost of land. Subject to parliamentary approval, demolition and site works are scheduled to commence in March-April 2014 with construction to be completed by October 2015. I commend the motion to the House.
