        We are taking stock of the year that was, with all its highs and its lows, and looking ahead to the coming year. But, before that comes to pass, we celebrate Christmas with our loved ones and with our local communities. Last Saturday I had a fantastic morning out in Salisbury for the annual community Christmas parade, an event that saw a turnout of thousands to see both Santa and, of course, me—in no particular order!—grace the main streets of Salisbury and spread a great deal of much-needed Christmas cheer. It was fantastic to see a number of familiar faces amongst those participating and spectating alike, along with their families, including many of my state parliamentary colleagues and the community leaders, local business owners and many local identities who make Salisbury a great place to represent and work.

        The parade was a credit to the hard work and logistical wizardry that went into making Saturday such a huge success by none other than David Waylen and the Salisbury Business Association team, along with the

        . I can't wait to come back and do this all again next year and make enough popcorn to give out to the hundreds of kids who visited my stall, along with their parents and caregivers. It was an experience that made smelling phantom butter and salt aromas almost a week after entirely worth it. Just in closing, I'd like to send a message to all my colleagues and the chamber attendants, the staff in this building and our communities back home: I hope you all have a very safe and prosperous Christmas. Stay safe.
