        The removal of the Parthenon sculptures is one of humanity's greatest cultural and artistic travesties.

        at the height of the Athenian empire, was one of the world's most important architectural, engineering and artistic feats. The temple, whose remnants still remain today, was adorned with the most significant hand carved relief metopes narrating the story of Athens. It is an artistic and cultural masterpiece. It 1801, the seventh

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bruce" rel="nofollow">

        , effectively bribed local Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the Parthenon sculptures and shipped them to England for his private collection. Effectively, the Parthenon sculptures were stolen. In 1816, under financial pressure to settle a debt, the Earl of Elgin sold the artefacts to the British government, and they remain in the

       <p>
        The modern state of Greece has on many occasions sought to have the sculptures returned, but the British government continues to refuse that request. Even successive opinion polls in Britain support the return of the sculptures. Greece has offered concessions on numerous occasions for their return.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greeks" rel="nofollow">

        have offered to provide a permanent, ongoing display to the British Museum on loan. In 2013, the Greek government sought the assistance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
         UNESCO
        </a>
        and UNESCO offered to mediate the dispute between the British and Greek governments. Once again, the British government refused. Because of this British recalcitrance there has been a growing international campaign for the return of the sculptures. In Australia, and internationally, many high-profile supporters are campaigning for their return. Supporters in the political sphere in Australia include former Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam,

        Last week the Parliamentary Friendship Group for the Parthenon was created. It is a body that will serve to enhance Greek and Australian relations and help raise awareness of the historical and cultural importance of the Parthenon and, importantly, campaign for the return of the Parthenon sculptures. I was pleased to see

       <p>
        The importance of the sculptures to Greece as a nation and to the people of Hellenic descent throughout the world, including Greek-Australians, cannot be overstated. I am proud to be part of the campaign to return the Parthenon sculptures to Greece. I am proud to lend my voice to the international and Australian campaigns. And I am proud that this parliament, in a bipartisan manner, has recognised the importance of these cultural artefacts and sought to establish a parliamentary friendship group for the return of these important artistic and cultural artefacts to their rightful home in Greece.
