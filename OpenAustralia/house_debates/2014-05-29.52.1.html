       <p>
        I want to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry on behalf of local manufacturers in my electorate of Hasluck.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, the parliamentary secretary, the Hon. Bob Baldwin MP, visited Hasluck and hosted a roundtable discussion on the topic of intellectual property. Hasluck has many innovative and creative local manufacturers and it is vital that we protect their ideas and products.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had many discussions with local manufacturers on how we can strengthen the protection of Australian designs and products. Those who were able to meet with the parliamentary secretary were impressed with his knowledge, insight and advice. One manufacturer who we visited said that he felt that, Bob Baldwin MP was a very professional person in his approach, based on his years of experience in the metal industry and engineering.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is one of the great things about members on this side of the House: the wealth of real life knowledge and experience on these benches is a great asset to the government and to the people of Australia. That is why people trust this government to do the right thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        As evidenced through the parliamentary secretary's visit to Hasluck last week, we on this side of the House listen to all of the hard-working Australians in the local community and will continue to seek ways of giving people a hand up, rather than a handout. I look forward to working with the parliamentary secretary to build a stronger local manufacturing industry in Hasluck.
