        The Hunter Region Business Excellence Awards recognise outstanding achievements for businesses and individuals across the Hunter. Whether it's industrial trades, tourism, finances or personal services, it all comes back to our incredible community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Laxmi Nahar, of Morpeth Family Medical Practice, was awarded Business Woman of the Year. Laxmi and her husband, Dr Amrit Nahar, opened their practice in 2011 and have spent the last 13 years being tirelessly dedicated to their patients and providing excellent medical advice and education. As of today, Laxmi and her husband have more than 6,000 patients on the books and five doctors employed. It's people like Laxmi who make our community strong and connected. She empowers women, our senior citizens, survivors of domestic violence and young people looking for medical advice, often at very sensitive and tender times. She inspires people to be stronger, safer and better aware of their own health. They know that they'll always be heard and understood at Morpeth Family Medical Practice. I'd like to offer a heartfelt congratulations to Dr Nahar. I congratulate her on her reward and thank her for everything she has done.

        Alongside Dr Nahar, the Mai-Wel Group, which is an institution in Maitland, was awarded the Not-For-Profit Business of the Year Award for the work that they do with our people with disabilities. They do incredible work. I'm so proud to think that they achieved that. Chisholm based business Get Fit For Life was awarded the Health Services Business of the Year Award. Isn't that a message for us allâ€”to get fit for life? Rutherford's

        I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate those in my electorate who received King's birthday honours. They are: Sharon Pope, who lives in Lochinvar, for her outstanding work in urban and regional planning;
