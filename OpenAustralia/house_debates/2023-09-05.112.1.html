        I recently had the opportunity to attend the Monash Precinct Network industry roundtable, where I had the great privilege to spend the afternoon with representatives of some outstanding organisations in my community. The Monash Precinct Network is at the heart of a globally significant innovation cluster in my electorate. World-class organisations form this whole precinct network. Member organisations include pharmaceutical manufacturers, defence manufacturers, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Synchrotron" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Synchrotron
        </a>
        and advanced manufacturing and medical technology companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Monash Precinct Network launched in April this year, and I have been so pleased to be able to support this important and strategic initiative. The precinct contributes $9.4 billion to the economy each year and supports more than 13,000 businesses and more than 82,000 employees, which is quite extraordinary. This precinct is world-class and it delivers impact globally, contributing to productivity, prosperity and the improvement of communities locally and internationally. This industry partnered precinct translates discovery into tangible outcomes in areas ranging from the next generation of pharmaceutical products and medical therapies to automated machines and robotics. It is a really collaborative network underpinned by a unique integrated network of infrastructure which enables all of the partners of the precinct to push the limits of computing, imaging and materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having this precinct located in such a good part of the world, in my electorate, which is connected to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University
        </a>
        and two vital public transport infrastructures, means that we attract the highest calibre of students. They get to work alongside the best and in a wonderful environment too.
       </p>
       <p>
        The industry roundtable was attended by representatives from across industry, including from Monash University, the Eastern Innovation precinct, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research" rel="nofollow">
         Medical Research
        </a>
        and other partners, including the Monash Tech School, CSIRO, the Australian Synchrotron and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Fabrication_Facility" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National Fabrication Facility
        </a>
        . I'm really proud to be able to represent an electorate that has all these wonderful organisations that call Chisholm home. The topics of conversation were broad and it was a really engaging conversation, ranging from attracting and retaining a future workforce in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        and accessing the talent and skills of the future to being a sector of choice when it comes to career choices for women.
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't take for a second the opportunity to represent this community for granted. I do not take for granted the amazing contribution that the precinct makes to the nation. I want to take a moment to really congratulate all of the members for the work that they do. I want to acknowledge the general manager of the Monash Precinct Network, Janine Shearer, along with the board, for the invitation to attend the industry roundtable event and other events. I really do look forward to my further engagement with the Monash Precinct Network and its member organisations in the future. I assured all of the organisations present at the time—and I want to put this on the record now—that I will always be a fierce advocate in this place and as a member of the government for the work they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the enormous opportunity that exists through the National Reconstruction Fund and the other really visionary work that our government is doing to enhance industry in this country as well as research in the higher education space. I know a number of organisations have made submissions to the Australian Universities Accord process, as I have, and I really value the feedback they've been able to provide me to make sure that my contribution is going to be truly representative of the community that I have the pleasure to represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The connection between universities, vocational education and training, and industry in my electorate is something that I think is truly nation-leading. I'm very proud to represent such an amazing part of Australia. I'm also very eager to continue conversations with colleagues in this place about how we can work collectively and collaboratively to realise the amazing potential that all communities in our country, including my electorate of Chisholm, have when it comes to making sure that we are a country that invests in the future, has wonderful sovereign capability and is a place where people want to study, work and live.
