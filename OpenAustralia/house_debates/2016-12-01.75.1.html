        'Our whole lives are on this street,' is what Margaret, Kevin, Craig and Janet told me about their home in Warrane, in my electorate. Earlier this year they had been told by the state Liberal government and Housing Tasmania that they would have to move before Christmas because their home of more than 50 years was going to be demolished. They were told, 'The property has been a good long-term home but it is now at the end of its lifespan'—a pretty callous letter to receive in the mail. They came to see me, and of course I took this up with the state Liberal government and the state minister. Disappointingly, I heard back that the government and the housing department were not going to change their position—that this family, who had lived in this home for more than 50 years, and had raised a family there, were going to be evicted just before Christmas, and their house, their home, was going to be demolished. I took this up again with the minister on many occasions, but it took me going to the local media and talking to a local newspaper—who of course were very interested in this story—to actually get a response from the state housing commission and the state government. Finally, the family have now heard that their home will not be demolished. I am so pleased to get this fantastic result for Margaret and Kevin. I am so happy that they will be able to stay in their home this Christmas. I wish them and all of my constituents a very Merry Christmas indeed.
