        by leaveâ€”You may not be aware that the Liberals and Nationals have teamed up with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        and Senator Van to introduce a motion to disallow 60-day prescriptions in the Senate, moving to block cheaper medicines for six million Australians. Those are six million Australians who are currently paying for medicines every 30 days. Under this bill, people on regular prescriptions will only need to pay for prescriptions once every 60 days. Sixty-day prescriptions mean twice the medication for the cost of a single prescription, saving money and time for, as I said, six million Australians with an ongoing health condition and freeing up
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        visits. In my electorate at the moment it is challenging for people to get in to see a GP. This will free up GP visits and make medications cheaper for so many people. It makes absolute sense. So why is the coalition standing with One Nation and Senator David Van in an attempt to block this bill?
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will save people throughout Australia money and give them access to cheaper medicines for 60 days, rather than 30, which also means it is more convenient for citizens of Australia who need regular medications. Blocking access to cheaper medicines will also mean $1.2 billion worth of investment in community pharmacy will need to be withdrawn because it is funded by this saving.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        now has a choice: to allow access to cheaper medicines for six million Australians, as medical experts have recommended and every patient and doctor group has supported, or to accept the position of the coalition and the pharmacy lobby and force patients to pay double what they would under the Albanese government's policies. If senators are for cheaper medicines for six million Australians, they should vote accordingly and pass the Albanese government's bill.
