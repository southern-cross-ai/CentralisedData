        I am very pleased to be joined in the chamber today by the students from

        in my electorate. It has been my pleasure to hold mobile electorate offices in my electorate of Tangney to meet with residents close to their homes and businesses and hear directly from them about federal government matters affecting them. It has been really enjoyable setting up at local cafes across the electorate, listening to locals who call or stop in. Over a cup of coffee or two, I have spoken to so many people about their ideas and wishes for our local community and received constructive and frank advice about government policy and national issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank everyone that has visited the Tangney mobile offices. Your thoughts, feedback, advice and stories make me a better MP. If you have not had the chance to visit a Tangney mobile electorate office, there are more to come. In the winter recess of parliament I will be making sure that I have more Tangney mobile electorate office visits. Keep an eye out on Facebook or in the local papers for times and locations. I will make sure there are plenty of opportunities to catch up before work, even on Saturdays. I look forward to more mobile offices in Tangney, a regular feature of my time getting out and about, listening to my community, learning from them what is important to them, sharing with them the plans that this government has for our nation, for our state and for my community. If members opposite spent more time listening to hardworking, aspirational Australians in their electorate, perhaps they would not be debating some of the issues that we debate in this chamber like we do.
