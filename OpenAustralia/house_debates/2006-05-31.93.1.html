        One of the honours of being a member of this great chamber and one of the responsibilities that it brings is that you get to meet some really wonderful Australians. As the House adjourns tonight, I would like to bring to its attention one of those Australians: Mrs Edith Swaby, who is 108 years old today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very grateful for the interest that has been taken in her. Today she is featured on page 13 in the Victorian
        <i>

          Herald Sun
         </a>
         ,
        </i>
        in honour of her contribution over 108 years to the development of this great nation. I am also grateful to the journalist,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Terry Brown
        </a>
        , who has written a truly beautiful story about Edith Swaby.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was born on 31 May in 1898. It is worthwhile thinking about what was happening that far back. Terry Brown sets out clearly in the article that in 1898 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Football_League" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Football League
        </a>
        had only started its second season. Grafter had won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Cup
        </a>
        . It was before the advent of crayons, tea bags, bandaids or, dare I say it, the brassiere. It was the year before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . And Carbine was alive and producing horses that went on to become great champions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mention those facts because Mrs Swaby has seen so much in 108 years. It is a tremendous tribute to her to have reached the age of 108. Some assistance was sought from my office for tributes to be sent to her, but she organised her own birthday party at the age of 108. Without the assistance of an address book, she did all the invitations herself. She is very spritely for her age.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am looking forward to spending some time with her to discover the secret of her longevity. She did say to Terry Brown that she did not have a secret on how to beat time. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        None whatever. Just keep on living.
       </p>
       <p>
        She is a delightful Australian. She has had three children, two sons and a daughter, and currently has around 50 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She still enjoys playing the piano. Over a life of 108 years she lived with her husband in Donald, moved on from there to Horsham and currently resides in the Natimuk Nursing Home, a small community 15 minutes drive west of Horsham. She enjoys a wonderful lifestyle. She enjoys good fellowship with her coresidents at the Natimuk Nursing Home. It just proves how important the Commonwealthâ€™s investment is in aged care through those isolated regions that people like Mrs Swaby can enjoy a prosperous and productive sunset of their life. I remember her 100th birthday, and here she is at the sprightly age of 108 going on from strength to strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to pay her a wonderful tribute. I am hoping that she can keep on keeping on. Her contribution to the prosperity that subsequent generations have now enjoyed in this great nation is valued and appreciated. It is important that the federal chamber recognises her contribution and the contribution of so many like her. It is interesting to realise that the number of centenarians in my constituency is growing enormously. It just proves the point again of the advantage of providing good aged care support to people who have earned the right to enjoy their sunset years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her husband came home wounded from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        but made a good go of it farming in the Donald region. It is sad that she lost him many years ago, as far back as 1968, but she has gone on to enjoy her children and grandchildren. The Nutimuk community today has celebrated greatly with Mrs Swaby. I join her, although geographically distant, and hope her day has been wonderful and enjoyable with her friends and relatives. I wish her even greater longevity.
