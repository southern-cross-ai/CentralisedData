        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Memorial Club celebrated its 65th year of service to our local community. Among the celebrations was a lunch organised to show its appreciation to its many life members. As an honorary member of that club, I was disappointed that I was unable to be there on that occasion due to my duties here in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cronulla RSL Memorial Club had very humble beginnings. During the war years the sub-branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League leased part of the Cecil Ballroom and the Cecil Casino buildings for the purpose of club rooms. These venues were used for dances that raised funds for activities that were consistent with the club’s objectives and as meetings rooms where the returned soldiers could gather.
       </p>
       <p>
        In February 1944 the returned soldiers and sailors held a special meeting that approved the formation of a soldiers club. The first president of the new club was the late Mr Edward (Ted) Dewe. Other names involved in the establishment of the club were sub-branch stalwarts,

        and Ray Prior. These men were determined to establish a place where returning servicemen could carry out their meetings and pursue sport and recreation, supporting each other in the process. August 1944 marked the official opening of the soldiers club by the Sutherland shire president.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1948 the club was renamed the Cronulla RSL Memorial Club. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire Council
        </a>
        played a significant part in the RSL club’s search for a permanent home. The Gerrale Street site was acquired by the club with the generous support of the council. It was not until 16 May 1953 that a permanent home for the club was opened. This building, which is still in use today, although it has been enlarged and altered to meet modern needs, has commanding views of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bate_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Bate Bay
        </a>
        area, which are absolutely breathtaking. It was officially opened by the then New South Wales Governor, Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott. The current club premises stand as a testament to the wisdom, leadership and hard work of the members of the Cronulla RSL sub-branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        A sad occasion for the club has been the recent passing of its longest serving life member, Don Collumbell. I was privileged to meet Don last year, when I listened to him talk about his experience as a

        , and I was able to pay tribute to him in our main chamber just last year in honouring his service. I join with the club in marking the passing of a great Australian in Don and agree that he will be sorely missed by all in our community and indeed our nation. Don’s funeral service was held at the Woronora crematorium and there was a large attendance of Don’s mates and good friends from the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fabric of the Sutherland shire community is truly privileged to be the home of the Cronulla RSL club and the associated sub-branch. I would particularly like to congratulate the club president, Mr Terry Crowe, members of the club board, the club
