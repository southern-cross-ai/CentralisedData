       <p>
        [by video link] I'm pleased to update the House on recent positive progress on the Townsville City Deal. As I've outlined before, I've been working with the community on the reallocation of $195 million earmarked for Townsville. This funding was originally for stage 2 of the Haughton pipeline but was rejected by the state Labor government. We ensured that this funding would stay here in Townsville. The deal partners have now agreed to further projects, which include $2 million for a business case for a concert hall, with the remaining $98 million to fund its construction; $12 million to match the state's contribution for enabling infrastructure for the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct; and $2 million for a feasibility study into recycled water for green hydrogen production. All three of these projects achieve the intended outcomes of the Townsville City Deal, which will make our place a better place to live, work and play.

        I spoke last time about the roadblocks that are hindering the delivery of these projects. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. The state Labor government is continuing to block funding for the

        just recently. Now they are complaining about the funding for the Lansdown project, despite the state begging for the Commonwealth's investment. No-one in state Labor jumped up and down about how the
