        I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by Senator Evans in October last year that the only contact between the government and Fair Work Australia regarding the investigation into the member for Dobell was by email in August 2011. Given that it has been revealed in estimates today that other phone contact occurred between Fair Work Australia and the former minister's office, has she satisfied herself that this is the only contradiction between the statements of her ministers and the truth?

         I understand that in Senate estimates today some additional information has been provided by Fair Work Australia. I also understand that a statement has been provided by Fair Work Australia, which I think is very important. It comes from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Manager" rel="nofollow">
          General Manager
         </a>
         , who directly deals with the opposition's oft repeated claims about political interference. It says very clearly that she sees absolutely no reason to conclude that there has been any such interference in the investigations.

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was not about political interference, it was about the contradictions and the statements of her ministers and the evidence that was adduced in estimates today.

           The Prime Minister has barely commenced answering the question. I am sure the Prime Minister is determined to be directly relevant.

           <p>
            I am determined to be directly relevant, Mr Speaker. I have been asked about contacts between the government and Fair Work Australia. I have been asked about those contacts before as part of the opposition's campaign to suggest that there has been political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation. Consequently, I think it is directly relevant to point out that this opposition campaign came to a crashing halt today, when the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Manager" rel="nofollow">
             General Manager
            </a>
            of Fair Work Australia directly repudiated any suggestions of political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation. From today it is clear, and should be clear to the opposition and all, that Fair Work Australia is doing what it is supposed to do—inquiring independently—and that there is no need in the world for continued imputations and muckraking by the opposition.
