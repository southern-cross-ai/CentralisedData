       <p>
        As our economy shows signs of slowing, the Morrison government must deliver infrastructure projects to support local jobs and businesses. We have three shovel-ready projects in Jagajaga that have the support of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is the completion of the missing link in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Diamond Creek
        </a>
        Trail to connect the townships of Diamond Creek,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_Glen" rel="nofollow">
         Wattle Glen
        </a>
        and Hurstbridge. A completed trail link will connect
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Ranges
        </a>
        all the way to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne CBD
        </a>
        and be used by 360,000 people yearly. It is expected to generate more than $30 million in economic activity over 30 years and create the equivalent of 30 full-time jobs. With a total project cost of $12 million, I was proud that Labor promised $4 million for this at the election, if we were elected. There has already been $8 million committed to the project, with $4 million from the Andrews Labor government and $4 million from Nillumbik Shire Councilâ€”and this project is Nillumbik council's highest infrastructure priority. It has strong community support, notably from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_Blazers" rel="nofollow">
         Trail Blazers
        </a>
        group, as well as a dozen other community and sports groups. I commend Helen Legg, Rex Niven and all the Trail Blazers for their passion and years of advocacy to get the project so close to being fully funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another project in Jagajaga that is ready to go is the redevelopment of the iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Park
        </a>
        precinct in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Heidelberg" rel="nofollow">
         West Heidelberg
        </a>
        , home to Heidelberg United Football Club. This project has huge community support. The ground is used by other groups and the general public throughout the year.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyule_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Banyule City Council
        </a>
        has completed a master plan of the precinct and has set aside $3.1 million for the project. The Victorian Labor government has also committed $3.5 million. I was proud that federal Labor promised $2.5 million for this project at the last election, if we are elected. Importantly, the upgrades at the ground will include unisex change rooms to expand girls' and women's participation in sport, something that is so important for our community; expanded clubrooms and a new pavilion; a floodlit synthetic pitch for the club and for community use; and also a community recreation space so that more people in our community can use the ground, with a basketball-netball court there. Due to its sheer size, this project is planned to be delivered in stages. It deserves an investment from the Commonwealth to support its completion. I commend the team of champions at Heidy United for their advocacy, energy and passion to make this redevelopment a reality for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final project I bring today is a new bike path along the local Hurstbridge rail line. Labor promised $7 million for this project if elected. The project will link Greensborough and Montmorency train stations along the rail corridor to the broader path network. If the government is serious about supporting local jobs, these projects are the ones to start with.
