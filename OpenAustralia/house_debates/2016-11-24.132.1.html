        It was my great pleasure last Friday, the 18th, to go out to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Edinburgh to join with A Squadron 1st Armoured Regiment to celebrate the 99th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cambrai" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Cambrai
        </a>
        . The Rampaging Rhinos, as they are known, put on a perfect parade, might I say, involving armoured personnel carriers. The use of those vehicles was perfection, I have to say. It was a very well conducted parade and the squadron, its officers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCO" rel="nofollow">
         NCO
        </a>
        s and personnel all have much to be proud of. It was one of those events that as a politician you have to go to, but you are always amazed at the professionalism and the excellence that is shown by our ADF personnel.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle" rel="nofollow">
         The Battle
        </a>
        of Cambrai was the first time that tanks were used on battlefields—on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
         Western Front
        </a>
        —and that occurred on 20 November 1917 with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Tank_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Tank Regiment
        </a>
        . So, it is about A Squadron tracing a link back to that first battle and the use of the tank, an armoured vehicle, in combination with artillery and with infantry. Of course, it was a unique event in the history of warfare and foresaw all of what was to happen in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and in battles afterwards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, we always pray for peace, but we know we live in a troubled world. In a troubled world you do need a defence force, you need it to be modern, you need it to be well trained and you need it to be professional. We saw all of that plus great spirit, great tradition and great honour from the Rampaging Rhinos. I look forward to having more parts of the Armoured Regiment in my electorate. I look forward to seeing more parades and I look forward to joining with them for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Cambrai where, no doubt, they will put on another great parade.
