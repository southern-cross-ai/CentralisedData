       <p>
        I was saddened earlier this year to learn of the passing of one of the kindest gentleman I have had the pleasure of knowing,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Christie" rel="nofollow">
         John Christie
        </a>
        . John was born in 1947 in Sydney and moved to Rockhampton in the early 1990s to work for Australian airExpress. John was not only a strong advocate for the Rockhampton community but a stalwart of both the Nationals and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal National Party
        </a>
        for over 20 years. John was vital to the operation of the Rockhampton and Capricornia committees for a long time, taking on the rarely desired roles of treasurer and secretary for a number of years. John was a huge supporter of mine in my first attempt for the seat of Capricornia in 2010 and then again in 2013 and 2016. Nothing was ever too hard for John, who was always there doing the nitty-gritty roles that nobody else desired.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although politics was a consuming passion for John, his wife, Faye, step-daughter, Kaylene, and grandchildren, Liam and Jaydee, were his life. John married his cherished wife, Faye, 19 years ago and loved her with everything he had until he passed away, never failing to get her breakfast in bed, even when he was unwell. Sadly, as happens too often, cancer caught John before his time. John battled with this ugly disease for a number of years but never let it get him down. John sadly passed away on 9 January and will be sorely missed by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Rest in peace, John. We will not forget you.
