        What a wonderful tribute. It also highlighted the dangers of supporting the

        The 2024 federal budget invests in building a better and fairer education system for all Australians in early education and care, schools,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and universities. Programs like the Schools Upgrade Fund are excellent examples of this federal investment. The Albanese Labor government is delivering on our promise to invest in our schools. I was pleased to see that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Richardson Primary School
        </a>
        and Isabella Plains Early Childhood School in Bean shared over $1 million in federal funding. Seven schools in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        will benefit from a share of $2.5 million in grants to build or upgrade infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding is part of the more than $250 million commitment to improve school infrastructure across the country. This fund provides more equitable access to resources to support schools to help keep students and school staff safe and get students' education back on track after disruptions caused by COVID-19. From upgrading classrooms to new outdoor equipment, this funding will deliver upgrades to public schools that need it the most and is another important step in building a better and fairer education system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I had the opportunity to visit Richardson Primary School and was shown how this funding will improve learning spaces by Deputy Principal Sally Alexander. I also joined Principal Simon Barker and toured where new outdoor play spaces will go at the Isabella Plains Early Childhood School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Public schools with the greatest need have been prioritised, including schools with higher numbers of students from a low socioeconomic background,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        students and students with disability. These school infrastructure upgrades are another great example of the ACT and Commonwealth government working collaboratively to deliver positive outcomes for Canberrans.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government is offering the biggest increase in federal funding to public schools that has ever been delivered. In addition to other announcements, the budget also included $4 million for the Together for Humanity program to expand their social cohesion programs into more schools. This will expand their reach into underrepresented jurisdictions and communities, as well as increase activities aimed at addressing all forms of discrimination in schoolsâ€”in particular, antisemitism and Islamophobia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government is committed to working with states and territories to fully fund all schools across the country. The government is offering states and territories the largest investment in Australia's public education system ever delivered. The budget is a key step in building a better and fairer education system for every Australian, where more people will attend early education, finish school and go to TAFE or university.
