         I thank the member for Corangamite for his question, because climate change is about our responsibility to future generations. This government accepts that responsibility. We must cut carbon pollution to protect the environment for future generations at the same time as we continue to grow our economy, because reducing the emissions of the economy is the key to future competitiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the carbon price began on 1 July last year, it is important to note the facts. More than 150,000 new jobs have been created at the same time as the economy has grown at an annualised rate of 2.5 per cent. Interest rates are low, inflation is contained and unemployment is at one of the lowest rates amongst the advanced economies. These are important facts in this debate. At the same time, since carbon pricing commenced, renewable energy generation is up 30 per cent and the most emissions-intensive coal fired power stations' emissions are down 14 per cent. Emissions in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market" rel="nofollow">
          National Electricity Market
         </a>
         in particular have fallen by almost 12 million tonnes as the energy we are using is becoming cleaner.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is the effect of carbon pricing, and right around the country businesses are making the changes that reduce pollution and make them more competitive over time. Farmers and meat processors are capturing their methane and turning it into electricity. Sugar mills are recycling their sugarcane waste to power their operations and selling electricity into the grid. Landfills are capturing methane, converting it into electricity and selling electricity into local communities. The government took the responsible course of action in tackling this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, of course, the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition have travelled around the country making the most irresponsible, deceitful and mendacious claims; threatening people over their jobs; causing fear for their job security; telling communities their entire town will be wiped out and their industries will be destroyed; and, worst of all—most irresponsible of all—frightening people on low incomes like pensioners around the country that they would not be able to afford their grocery bills once the carbon price commenced. Demonstrably false. Never ever offering any credible alternative policy—just a mendacious scare campaign. And, as the mendacity went up and up and up, it has cleaned out its credibility big time. You will be called out for it.
