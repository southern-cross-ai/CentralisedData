       <p>
        On Friday, I visited Montello Primary School. Miss Howard and Mr Langford's grade 5 classes are studying government and democracy. They're also starting to think about what jobs they might look to do when they leave school. Let me tell you, you couldn't find a bunch of more enthusiastic, smart and fun kids than these grade 5s at Montello Primary School. We started the session by looking at the role of media in my office. The students showed us that they already had outstanding writing skills and social media skills, and they developed a Facebook post and joint media release about our visit. I then had a chat to them about what I do in Braddon as a federal representative. We talked about how parliament works and how different tiers of government work and how that's important for them as kids.
       </p>
       <p>
        Montello Primary School has done a great job nurturing these people. I know that sitting in the classrooms are our region's future leaders, and maybe even the nation's future leaders. I want to remind students that, when it comes to jobs, the sky's the limit. You can do and achieve whatever you are prepared to work hard to do. Thank you, Miss Howard and Mr Langford and all the great kids, for making me so welcome at your school, Montello Primary School.
