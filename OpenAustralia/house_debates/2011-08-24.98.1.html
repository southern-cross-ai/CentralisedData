        Balcatta Soccer Club, one of the great soccer clubs within my electorate, was on the Sunday before last presented with the All Flags League—the highest league of soccer in

        at Grindleford Reserve. Balcatta Soccer Club sealed the premiership with four games left to play, and in only their second year in the premier league, which is quite an achievement. This is the first time that a team has won the premiership in their second year in the premier league, and to top it off Balcatta remains 11 points ahead of the team in second position. I might add, for the record, that I am the No. 1 ticket holder for Balcatta Soccer Club and very proud to be so.
       </p>
       <p>
        This achievement has capped off what has been a fine year and the team is still tipped to claim end-of-season honours. The coaching staff, consisting of Michael Roki, Peter Vatistas, Saul Contera and Johnny Vastistas, has done a fine job this season, as have the dedicated and passionate volunteers who keep the club afloat. Captain and leading goal scorer Ashley Rosindale and vice-captain Adam Tong, along with his teammates Bobson Karoma, Lewis Italiano—who I have been told has had an exceptional season—Adam Stillitano, Chris Thakray, Jack Clisby,

        Balcatta Soccer Club goes far beyond what is expected of any normal sporting unit, especially when it comes to community support and engagement. Balcatta Soccer Club has donated over $10,000 to various charities in Western Australia, including a $2,500 donation to the telethon appeal. Similarly, the club collects new and used soccer equipment and uniforms to send to an orphanage in El Salvador.
       </p>
       <p>
        A true testament to the club is last year's winning of the fair play award. The award was won by the men's premier league and was accompanied by a prize of $2,000 for the club. Balcatta was the only team in both the premier league and first division to not receive one red card. Pat Luca, the club's president, who is generally a human dynamo, continues to do an excellent job of engaging the players, members and sponsors in every aspect of the club. He is a very difficult man to say no to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure the Balcatta Soccer Club will continue to set a fine example in the league as an exceptional community grown and driven organisation, and I wish all the players, members, coaching staff, committee members, sponsors and fans all the best for the coming end-of-season honours and the season ahead.
