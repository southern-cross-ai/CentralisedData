        My question is addressed to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Given the Bolivia Hill upgrade on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         New England Highway
        </a>
        was funded in the 2013 budget, why did it take until last week for tenders to be called on this vital project? Why has the government only acted now when the project was fully funded more than four years ago? Is it because the government and the Deputy Prime Minister are preparing for a snap by-election in New England?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Grayndler for his audition for the leadership of the Labor Party. At least the member for Grayndler is talking about an issue that people in regional Australia care about, being investment in land transport infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         All this week those opposite have been asking questions about issues that, quite frankly, people on work sites around Australia couldn't care less about. They couldn't care less about the questions that the Leader of the Opposition has come up with. But at least the member for Grayndler has raised an issue of significant importance to the people of New England.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank and congratulate the member for New England for his hard work in advocating on behalf of his community to deliver the infrastructure that he knows will change people's lives and save people's lives in his community. He knows that investment in good infrastructure will change lives and save lives. As to the way it's changing lives, it's reducing congestion, improving productivity and creating jobs in regional Australia, particularly in the seat of New England—the seat which has never had better representation than it's getting right from the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party. The Bolivia Hill project that the member for Grayndler referred to will save lives as well. We understand that that project that will improve safety on this important transport link through the New England region.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also add that the member for New England has been an extraordinary advocate for infrastructure right across his electorate, which gives me the opportunity to reflect for a moment on how hard he worked in delivering record funding for the inland rail.

           Yes, Mr Speaker. It goes to relevance. The question went to why it was funded in 2013—

            <p>
             In relation to the Bolivia Hill project, it is important to note that Labor did nothing on that project in the time that it was in government. We're getting on with the job of delivering better, safer roads in the New England region, which, as I said earlier, will change lives and will save lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             The member for New England was fundamentally the driving force behind the inland rail project, with the support of colleagues right along the route. The member for Parkes, the member for Riverina, the member for Groom and the member for Maranoa are all strong advocates for the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail project that is being delivered by this government.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I do thank the member for Grayndler for his question. At least we know that one member opposite is actually interested in issues that people in regional Australia care about. They care about better roads, they care about the cost of living and they care about affordable, reliable energy. What they don't care about is this Leader of the Opposition, who they know is very shifty. They know they can't trust him and they know that he is not interested in their jobs in regional Australia.
