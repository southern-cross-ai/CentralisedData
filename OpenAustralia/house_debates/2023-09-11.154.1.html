        There is a tidal wave of support for the Voice in my community, and I could not be more proud. On Friday, I had the privilege of participating in a diversity panel with the amazing elders, Carol Innes and Oral McGuire. They are smart, kind and fierce. It was a very moving panel. It was an amazing experience where everyone in the room wanted this to happen, but not only do we want this to happen, we want to step up and help make this happen.

        On Saturday, I went doorknocking in Cannington. Many first-time doorknockers wanted to step up and help their community get the word out. I want to give a special shout-out to Mitch and Andrew, the first-time doorknockers I went with. On Sunday, before I jumped on a plane to come to Canberra, I went to the Vic Park farmers markets. Again, my community there had a sea of 'vote yes' corflutes. Fifty people were rocking up to the markets to collect their corflute signs because it was a message of positivity and hope. It was great to see councillors Jesvin Karimi, Bronwyn Ife and Wilfred Hendriks and community members David, Linda and Leandro.

        The support doesn't stop there. There is a wall of community organisations, and, every Friday, we've been sharing information with people coming up to the wall of support for Swan. There's the Vic Park Raiders Football Club, the Charter Work Drinks, the Southern Chronicles, Hugo Jorge: Counselling and Coaching, the Eclectic Squirrels, Star Street Uniting Church,

        What do all these organisations have in common? It would be difficult to pick out one trait. Some are large corporations, some are small corporations, and some are owner led businesses, from religion to sport. They have two things in common. The first is that they all operate in my electorate. The second one is that they're willing to step up and shape our nation for the positive, one that will place our nation on the right side of history and one that will unite our nation. They are organisations that are united by one pledgeâ€”a pledge to do better. It is a pledge to do better for our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        people and to recognise First Nations people in the Constitution and to do that in a meaningful way by giving them a voice to parliament. We are voting yes! I don't have time to name them all today, but I will say that the wall of support shows the enormous amount of support for the yes vote in the electorate of Swan. I could not be prouder.
