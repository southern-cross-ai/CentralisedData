        in Parliament Week, the future leaders of tomorrow submitted speeches to their local members in the hope that their words would be read in parliament. My speech today was written by 16-year-old Ella Marshall, who lives in Moreton:

        members, I'm scared. I'm scared that my dreams and many other young peoples' dreams of seeing the wonders of Australia may end up becoming just a story told around the dinner table. That our dreams of a future with these places unaffected by climate change will be as unreachable as a six-year-old wanting to be an astronaut.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Climate change is impacting every Australian's life. From summer school uniforms being modified to combat the unnatural temperatures in heatwaves, to farmers struggling financially, mentally, and physically as they wake up each morning with dying land. It's heartbreaking watching good, hard-working Australian's face the impacts that are a result of profit over people. It needs to stop. The disbelief and the disregard of climate change-induced weather events need to stop. I do not want our country to spend another year with television screens around the world streaming red skies and dying kolas. You can pass the bills to make the change and help me see those wonders in twenty years.
       </p>

        Thanks for those words, Ella, I hope the Deputy Prime Minister has heard Ella's words today.
