        Higher education is integral to achieving the federal Labor government’s vision of a stronger and fairer Australia. It drives economic development, productivity and high-skilled jobs. In that context, two weeks ago I had the pleasure of representing Senator the Hon.

        Facilities funding recognition ceremony at the Bremer TAFE facility at Bundamba, in my electorate of Blair. I was later given a tour of the facilities by the Acting Institute Director, Mr Michael Thomas, and the

        , Mr Brad Fisher.

       <p>
        The ceremony was to officially recognise the funding received by the TAFE at the initiation of the federal Labor government under the Teaching and Learning Capital Fund for

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Nolan" rel="nofollow">

        , made the remark in her speech that in her 10 years as a local state member this was the first time she had seen any federal money going toward TAFE. This is a terrible indictment of the Howard government, which deprived all levels of the education sector of the funding they so desperately needed during the 11 years of that government’s reign. It sought to impose
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        on each sector and to link funding to the same. That is why the $2 million of federal Labor government funding provided to help address the immediate maintenance needs, small capital works and equipment and plant purchases was so warmly welcomed by the staff, the students and the Blair community at the Bremer TAFE. The TAFE has about 13,000 students.

        Every person deserves the right to a first-class education. It is one of the greatest gifts that we can give our young people. It allows them to achieve personal success and contribute to the nation’s prosperity. World-class TAFEs are just as important as first-class sandstone universities. The refurbishment and upgrade of equipment at the Bundamba campus will enhance the quality of training already delivered there. It is great to see the expansion of its facilities and the warmth of the community’s approval for it.

        The establishment of the Bundamba campus so many years ago was not without controversy, such was the sentiment and sympathy for the old technical college in the heart of the Ipswich CBD. The $2 million received by the Bremer TAFE is part of $200 million of funding being provided through Better TAFE Facilities to TAFEs across the country and, in particular, to community training providers to offer job-ready accreditation and vocational education and training. The Bundamba campus is a wonderful facility; it is a wonderful initiative for my electorate. Projects receiving funding include the upgrading of the Mary Street crossing; the refurbishment of
