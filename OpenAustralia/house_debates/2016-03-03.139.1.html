        The beef industry is very important to my region, not only to the producers but also to the over 1,000 people who work at the local meatworks in Casino. I say to the locals who work there, 'What you do is important to not only to our town but the whole region, and indeed our country, because 70 per cent of what the meatworks produces is exported.' That is similar for other agricultural exports in our region like macadamias and blueberries. This provides exceptionally crucial export income to our country. It is industries and businesses like these that provide income to fund the standards of living and the way of life that we have.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new free trade agreements help businesses like the meatworks. It is allowing new markets and access for our products. We now have better markets into China,

        </a>
        and Japan and are currently working on one with India. This is helping our meatworks. This is helping our farmers in all areas like beef, dairy macadamias blueberries, sugar and the list goes on. Ensuring job security and export income is a primary focus of this government as it should be.

        This Saturday I will be attending the 2016 Lismore Samson Fitness Challenge. This gruelling challenge has become an annual event in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Rivers
        </a>
        to raise money for the charity
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Kids" rel="nofollow">
         Our Kids
        </a>
        , which raises funds to purchase paediatric equipment for the children's ward and special care nursery at

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Samson Challenge is a four-person team event with each team put through nine challenges, which includes a farmer's walk with jerry cans, a prowler push, 136-kilogram truck tyre flip, a burpee challenge, two by two-kilometre run, a one-kilometre swim, a mystery leg and a crazy obstacle course to complete. I will not be competing but I will certainly be there enjoying the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The quickest team to complete all the challenges wins the coveted Samson Title and bragging rights for the next twelve months. Since the Samson Challenge started a couple of years ago, it has raised more than $75,000 for Our Kids.

        I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the executive of Our Kids and its fundraising coordinator, Rebekka Battista. And of course, not of this would be possible without the support of local businesses. I would like to acknowledge some of this year's sponsors: Telstra,
