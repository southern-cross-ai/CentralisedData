       <p>
        Yesterday I attended the funeral of Kathryn McKay and Greg Hosa, well-known local identities in the electorate of Gilmore. We have had some unwanted headlines. You might recall that these are the people who were murdered and their bodies found in the state forest burning in barrels. Some 800 people attended the funeral yesterday. They came from all walks of life and different backgrounds, which just goes to show how well-respected in the community this family was. Greg and Kathryn left behind a 10-year-old son, Damon. Greg left behind another two children from a previous marriage. I point out to the parliament that these people were very big community workers. Both worked for the Nowra show.

        , the president of the Nowra show, spoke about the work they had done within the society. Kathryn was a nurse at Shoalhaven hospital. The whole of the hospital were in mourning for the sad loss of Kathryn and the work that she had done. The staff were extremely upset and through Monica Taylor and Wally de Ruyter, both of whom were devastated and were at the funeral, I express my condolences to the staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Damon, their son, went to the

        , and the family were very close-knit and attended the Baptist church. The community is still in shock and disbelief at the deaths, and to think that the murders were actually performed by those of our own community. I also want to thank Commander Kyle Stewart, of the Nowra police, for the outstanding work he and his team have done in bringing the murderers to account.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the family I say that I share their grief. I certainly join with the community in hoping that the perpetrators of these awful murders are soon brought to justice. As I said, our thoughts are with Greg’s and Kathryn’s families. The size of the attendance at the funeral is an indication of just how well this family was respected. I cannot begin to tell you the grief that will be felt throughout the Gilmore electorate with the loss of these people.
