        . To the teaching and support staff at all these schools: thank you very much for what you've done for and given to our kids over the last 12-plus years. Your patience, passion, perseverance and professionalism is hugely appreciated by all.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all the young people: you got this. COVID-19 has undoubtedly magnified the usual stresses that go along with leaving school. No doubt you've already been asked a zillion times, 'What are you going to do when you leave school?'—a question which is fine if you have a clear idea as to what you want to do, but it can be incredibly stressful if you don't. Just be reassured: it's very common for people to not have a clear idea as to what they want to do when they leave school, and it's perfectly normal to take some time to decide. You got this. Do your best. But remember: year 12 exams do not define you and don't dictate the rest of your life. Breathe deeply. Sleep well. Exercise. Laugh every day. Talk to friends. Ask for help.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know every school would have had a different graduation song this year, and at the risk of embarrassing my school-leaver son I say to him: my graduation song for you is Katy Perry's 'Firework'. Listen to it often, and listen to it loudly.
