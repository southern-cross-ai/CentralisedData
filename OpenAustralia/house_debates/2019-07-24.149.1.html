        Over the last few years I have been in many discussions with community groups in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Gardens" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks_Nest" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Karuah about a number of important local projects. The upgrade of Lionel Morten Park in Karuah—the home of the mighty Karuah Roos—has been on the agenda for some time, and the council had developed a plan for a $1.2 million upgrade of its facilities. Recently, I was very pleased to attend and announce that the federal coalition government was contributing $496,214 towards the exact project that I just outlined. That's part of our $30 million community sport infrastructure program. It will replace the existing clubhouse amenities, and a multipurpose sports amenity building will come in its place. That will allow for a food and drink kiosk, a referee's room, a first aid room, home and away unisex change rooms, storage areas, formalisation of accessible parking facilities, and public amenities including wheelchair-accessible facilities. It's got an extended awning so you can be undercover. Some days it is a bit wet up on the

        , and on other days, when the cricketers are playing, it's great to have the shade. I look forward to attending many more Roos games and maybe even turning up for a cricket match as well.

        In Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest, the local progress association and user groups of the Hawks Nest Community Centre have also been agitating for upgrade of the facilities. They are bursting at the seams. The existing community centre was opened in December 1970 and caters for a wide range of community groups, including the University of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age" rel="nofollow">

        , community health and seniors groups, youth activities and other community functions. Recently I was honoured to announce $300,000 towards the upgrade and expansion of the Booner Street centre, and I'm in discussions with council about their engagement with other groups. This will be a great bonus for Tea Gardens-Hawks Nest, because it is an area with a lot of seniors with a lot of experience. They're all very active, but there is no other venue appropriate for them to expand all these activities.

        Down the road, at the Tea Gardens Hawks Nest Surf Lifesaving Club, they are doing renovations to their facility. I was really pleased to be able to announce $300,000 out of the Community Development Grants Program to assist in the final stage of the upgrade. Congratulations to all these groups in Tea Gardens-Hawks Nest. As I've said many times, I listen to their concerns, I act and I deliver.
