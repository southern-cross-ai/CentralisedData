       This petition of the citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Our concerns, as parents, over the Government's plans (and of COAG) to impose National Quality Reform Agenda (NQA) reforms on long-day childcare that it expects families to effectively pay for. These reforms are due to begin on January 01, 2012.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We believe the costs will be more than we, the parents, can afford.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       As parents with children in long-day childcare, we're happy with the high quality of early learning our children currently receive. Whilst we welcome further improvements in childcare quality, we don't believe this should be a cost borne by - the families - nor by our childcare centre.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We feel the cost of living is high enough and we may either be forced to quit our jobs, reduce our childcare hours or withdraw our child(ren) altogether if these reforms force the cost of long-day childcare up any further.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to please ensure that you delay the implementation of the proposed National Regulations to support the NQA (that independent economic analysis shows will drive up the cost of long-day childcare by at least $13-$22 a day) until the government can pay for them and not us, the families.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Please listen to the concerns of parents and delay any considerations of regulations until the government is able to fully fund these changes.
