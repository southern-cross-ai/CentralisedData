       <p>
        Today I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to the retirement from public life of a very prominent Campbelltown personality. Gordon Fetterplace, the former Mayor of Campbelltown, and now the former Director of the Western Suburbs Leagues Club board, has decided to hang up his boots, as it were, when it comes to his involvement in the promotion and ongoing administration of sport in the Campbelltown region.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I cannot say I always agreed with Gordon’s politics, I cannot dismiss the influence he has had on the development of Campbelltown as a city and his influence on sport in my region. Gordon served with distinction on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbelltown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Campbelltown City Council
        </a>
        for 23 years. During that time he served seven terms as mayor. Gordon is known for his dedication to his community, and that dedication is reflected in his record of community service not only in local government but also through his involvement with the local sporting clubs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Gregory" rel="nofollow">
         St Gregory
        </a>
        ’s College and many other charitable organisations and service groups in the Campbelltown region.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has been a lifelong supporter of rugby league and took the opportunity to contribute to the development of the sport in the Campbelltown region, serving on the board of the Western Suburbs Leagues Club between 1994 and 1999. He was re-elected in 2002 and served the past five years in the capacity of director. The council and local sports groups were not the only beneficiaries of Gordon’s dedication. Gordon was also the patron of the Campbelltown Show Society. His commitment to the city has not gone unnoticed. In 1994 Gordon was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . In 2000 he was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         National Medal
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        More important than all of this is that Gordon is a committed and decent bloke. Gordon is well known and well respected in Campbelltown. His contributions to the city and the development of sport are greatly appreciated, and I offer that appreciation on behalf of a grateful community. I congratulate Gordon on his dedication to all aspects of his life in Campbelltown, to his contributions to the city and, importantly, to his contribution to sport. I wish Gordon and Barbara all the very best in his retirement from public life in Campbelltown. No doubt we will see him from time to time at weekend sporting events, particularly in relation to junior league events that occur in and about the Campbelltown region.
