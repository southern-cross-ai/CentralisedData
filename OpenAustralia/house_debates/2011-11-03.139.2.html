       <p>
        In Western Australia we recently had local government elections, and I thought I would take this opportunity today to speak about what happened within and around the area of the federal electorate of Cowan. Fortunately, I have three local governments that affect parts of Cowan: the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         City of Swan
        </a>
        . It was particularly gratifying to see a number of people elected who certainly will be defined in their terms in local government by their commitment to the best interests of the community rather than political posturing or opportunity. I thought I would run through some of the elected members who have come up.
       </p>
       <p>
        First is the city of Joondalup. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Ward" rel="nofollow">
         Central Ward
        </a>
        Geoff Amphlett was re-elected. It is great to see Geoff back. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ward" rel="nofollow">
         North Ward
        </a>
        Tom McLean, a good local councillor, has been returned. In North Central Ward Sam Thomas was elected. In South Ward, where I live, Teresa Ritchie was elected, and I congratulate her on her election. In the South-East Ward I congratulate Brian Corr for his re-election. I do that despite the fact that he has endorsed for the Labor Party in all of my three elections. I nevertheless congratulate him on his election. In the South-West Ward Mike Norman has also been re-elected unopposed, an endorsement of his position and standing in the community. With regard to the city of Joondalup, I also congratulate new Deputy Mayor John Chester, a resident of Kingsley. He is very prominent on environmental issues and is a great member of the Friends of Yellagonga. He does a great job for the people in that ward, and I am sure he will across the whole of the city. I also look forward to working more closely with them in the future as we work through and develop the Warwick sports club rooms at Hawker Park, which the mayor and I have had a number of talks about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over in the City of Swan there was no election because there were only two vacancies and only two stood. Maria Haynes was re-elected, and I congratulate Maria. Although she has always been endorsed for the Labor Party, I nevertheless congratulate her. I also congratulate Mel Congerton. Mel is defined as a local Ballajura resident who is characterised by great leadership and great hard work on his plan of having an aged care facility in Ballajura. He is certainly working very hard rather than just going for the photo opportunities, as his local opponents are defined by. That is good news for the City of Swan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to take the remainder of my time to talk about the City of Wanneroo. After quite a few years in the City of Wanneroo a former opponent of mine—he was the endorsed candidate for a little while—retired as mayor. He had been the endorsed Labor Party candidate in the electorate of Cowan for a few weeks. Now Tracey Roberts has been elected mayor. I congratulate Tracey. Again, it is great to see a genuine Independent running the City of Wanneroo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, Norm Hewer was re-elected in the North Ward. I congratulate Norm. Bob Smithson was re-elected on Coastal Ward and Russell Driver was also elected. In Central Ward Frank Cviten has returned to the council after being out for a couple of years. It is great to see Frank back again. He is a genuine local guy in Central Ward.
       </p>
       <p>
        In South Ward, Anh Truong, from the Vietnamese community was re-elected. Alan Blencowe was re-elected as well, along with a new councillor, Mr Denis Hayden. I know his wife, Judy, from Ballajura Primary School. He has a long history doing great welfare work in the police union. So that is all very good.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to say that even though Councillor Ian Goodenough of the City of Wanneroo was not up for re-election, he is known for his great work in the northern suburbs of Perth and in the City of Wanneroo. So I congratulate him for everything he does.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also congratulate the City of Wanneroo for the final completion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        . I was involved with organising $7 million from the Howard government for that. It was a bit overdue, but it is good to see it finally completed.
