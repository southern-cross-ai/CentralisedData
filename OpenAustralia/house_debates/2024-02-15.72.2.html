        My question is to the Prime Minister. Numerous workplaces in Australia have random alcohol and drug testing to help ensure a safe and respectful working environment. Will you commit to legislating for random alcohol and drug testing of MPs, senators and staff in the federal parliament due to the apparent ongoing issues with too much alcohol consumption?

         I thank the member for Warringah for her question, and I recognise that it comes from a place of genuine concern. There have been, of course, issues from time to time in the parliament. One of the things about our jobs is that we're accountable. Every three years at least, we go to the Australian people, and we're accountable for what we say, what we do and how we act. That is a democratic process that is appropriate. I would have thought that we were all responsible adults, and we should act appropriately out of respect for the people who vote to put us here.

         It is a great privilege to be a member of parliament, and many people try. Not as many succeed. I've had the privilege of being elected to this parliament 10 times, and every day I feel grateful and humbled to represent the community where I've lived my whole life, in the

         of Sydney, and to be able to occupy the extraordinary position of being Australia's 31st Prime Minister. I don't want to see us in a position where we say that we are unable to act like adults and where we have that suggestion made. So I understand why the member for Warringah makes it, but it's not something that I have supported. I think that people need to act responsibly at all times and to bear in mind the great privilege and honour that we have of being in various positions in this chamber, whether they be on the front bench of either side, whether they be backbench members or whether they be crossbench members, as well. I thank the member for Warringah for her question.
