        On Saturday 18 October I had the privilege of hosting the inaugural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        Community Awards. The awards were designed to acknowledge the quiet achievers—the volunteers in my seat of La Trobe. The people nominated for the awards simply amazed me. They were dedicated people in our community, giving countless hours of their time, with many volunteering at more than one organisation. They were a true credit to not only my electorate but all Australians.

        The awardees included: Karl Herring, who joined the Narre Warren Scout Group in 2007 and has continued to develop as an outstanding hardworking community leader; Jan Incoll, an active member of the Friends of

        Two organisations also received awards. The Narre Warren
