        On this day 14 years ago an unspeakable act of terror was perpetrated on innocent people, many of them Australian, who were enjoying a night out in a bar at

        in Bali—202 people from all over the globe, including Balinese locals, would never return home after that night. Eighty-eight of them were Australian, and 20 of them called

        junior rugby league clubs; surfers and surf lifesavers who shared a love of and affinity with the ocean and Bali's magnificent waves; community volunteers; and families simply enjoying a holiday in Bali. These were people who made our community such a special place to live; people who touched the lives of so many in our area. They were friends and family members we will never forget.

        at the Bali memorial. On Sunday I attended a memorial service in Malabar for seven members of that community who lost their lives. On behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith, my condolences go to all those who lost loved ones in this terrible tragedy. They will be forever in our hearts.
