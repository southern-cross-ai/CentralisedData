        I rise to support the comments made earlier to this parliament by the Hon. Mr

        ’s call for a dugong and turtle protection plan. We are very aware in South-East Queensland as well of the importance of the dugong to healthy waterways. Indeed, it is a symbol for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        regional area, and we are very conscious of the turtles and the dugongs being threatened by modern populations and the need to ensure that there is a protection plan. In fact, we were delighted when the coalition, during the election campaign, announced that it would allocate funding for a protection plan for dugongs and turtles. I do hope, as Mr Greg Hunt indicated, that there will be bipartisan support for this very important project.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is very important that we work with the Indigenous communities on this particular program, and I know that we have had indications of support from them. As part of the important environmental and marine conservation task, the coalition previously indicated that it would maintain existing funding and provide a total of $2.6 million, which was going to comprise $1.6 million for specialised Indigenous ranger programs for marine conservation along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        coast and for strengthened enforcement and compliance through supporting additional officers on the water and on land to crack down on dugong and turtle poaching and the illegal trade in dugong and turtle meat. There was also to be $1 million towards helping to clean up marine debris along the Far North Queensland coast, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait

        islands and in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Coral Sea
        </a>
        . Marine debris, especially ghost nets, as they are called, provides significant risk to dugongs and turtles, and I know we all want to take steps to clean these threats up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously we would consult with and support the work of the Indigenous communities in dealing with these threats. These positive measures would build on the coalition’s three-point plan for the protection of dugongs and turtles, through which we have already committed to work with the traditional owners to help them to put an end to poaching and the commercial sale of illegal dugong and turtle meat and to create jobs for local Indigenous people to preserve and protect dugongs and turtles. We would also ensure enforcement and prosecution of the illegal hunting and poaching of turtles and dugongs. The coalition’s dugong and turtle protection plan would initially run for two years and be subject to extension based upon its success. These measures would be designed in conjunction with traditional owners and Indigenous communities. The members on this side of the chamber are in support—

         Before calling the honourable member for Blair, I would remind all honourable members that, pursuant to standing order 64, members ought not be referred to by their names but by the name of their electorates.
