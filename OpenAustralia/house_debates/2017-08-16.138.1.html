        I'm a proud Australian, as are all members on this side of Chamber, and I am sure members on the other side of the Chamber are also proud Australians. I believe in mateship, inclusion, democracy, the rule of law and a fair go for all. Last night, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Yarra" rel="nofollow">
         City of Yarra
        </a>
        voted to remove all references to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        , and it decided that it will not hold a citizenship ceremony on Australia Day. Shame on them! Under the
        <i>
         Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Citizenship ceremonies are non-commercial, apolitical, bipartisan and secular. They must not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression or for the distribution of material which could be perceived to be of a commercial, political or religious nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        The code notes that there are two significant days on which people can become an Australian citizen: one is Australia Day on 26 January, and the second is Australian Citizenship Day on 17 September. Everyone who has attended a citizenship ceremony—and I'm sure those opposite have presided over them—would be very familiar with this: a presiding officer must be authorised by the minister. Under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, a person before whom the pledge is made 'must be authorised by the Australian government minister responsible for citizenship matters'. These people are usually referred to as presiding officers. Authorisation is given to Australian citizens only and is specific to a position or a person, so there are very specific legal requirements as to what can and can't be done and who can and can't do it.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's interesting to note that, just prior to the citizenship pledges being taken, there is a preamble, and the presiding officer says this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        , and Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity.
       </p>
       <p>
        It goes onto talk about the pledge to loyalty to Australia. But it says, 'uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity.' The Yarra City Council stands condemned today for its actions last night. If the Yarra City Council is not prepared to abide by its obligations under the
        <i>
         Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code
        </i>
        , then the council and, indeed, the mayor, Amanda Stone, should have their position as presiding officer revoked.
