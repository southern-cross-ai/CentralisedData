        Earlier today I spoke about the importance of road safety, especially during the summer, school and Christmas holiday period. But the fact is that road safety and being a responsible road user are of critical importance every single day. I know this all too well in my electorate of Boothby due to the tragic death of Mrs Nicole Tucker on 6 October this year.

        Mrs Tucker was a dedicated mother. She was driving home after dropping off her 16-year-old daughter when a stolen ute travelling at 160 kilometres per hour crashed into her car. I pay tribute to Mrs Tucker, her husband and two children and her family and friends, who have bravely said that they will remember her as the outgoing, bubbly and caring person that she was. Mrs Tucker was described as an extremely caring mother who put everyone else first and herself a long way second. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends, particularly over the Christmas period.

        Mrs Tucker's life was senselessly and tragically cut short by a criminal. Sadly, the circumstances surrounding this tragedy are not unique. I commend
