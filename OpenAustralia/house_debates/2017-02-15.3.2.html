        (a) in the coming weeks, more than one million Australians will resume their university studies for the 2017 academic year;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government's failure to release its plans for university funding and fees is creating uncertainty for students planning to commence their studies in 2018 and beyond;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Australian students already pay some of the highest university fees in the

        (b) rule out significant fee increases;
