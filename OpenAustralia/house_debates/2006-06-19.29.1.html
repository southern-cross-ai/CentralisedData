       <p>
        The Australian government recognises the importance of providing schools with facilities that will enhance the education and wellbeing of students. It is very disappointing that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government does not feel the same way. I was absolutely disgusted to learn over the weekend that the New South Wales government has charged 80 schools up to $650,000 for advice and management of maintenance projects funded by the Commonwealth government under the Investing in Our Schools program. In most cases, the schools sought federal grants after failing to secure funding from the state government for things like airconditioning, electrical upgrades and work on essential services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Narara Valley High School, in my electorate of Dobell, paid a whopping $15,675 of its $110,000 grant to the department to manage upgrades to the school’s kitchen. The Australian government introduced this program to counter Labor’s disregard for our local state schools, which they are primarily responsible for funding. The program is about getting more resources into our public school system, not about the state earning some extra cash on the side to the detriment of hardworking local school communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I visit many schools on many occasions, and they are all in need of quality equipment and infrastructure. I call on state Labor to put an end to this ridiculous cash grabbing that is hurting our schools and their students. It might also look at its dental responsibilities, as the member for Richmond mentioned earlier.
