        Another exciting opportunity in Warwick has been created by Cathy Ryan and her sister, Kim Bailey. They are transforming the old Baringa Nursery into the Baringa Gardens and Little Kimmy's Tea Rooms. Cathy and Kim are going to offer the Warwick community a unique and beautiful garden venue with catering for those very special occasions. A big congratulations go to Cathy and Kim for seeing an opportunity and being willing to seize it.

        The investment of these entrepreneurs demonstrates that if government puts the right environment around small business they will have the confidence to invest in communities like Warwick.
