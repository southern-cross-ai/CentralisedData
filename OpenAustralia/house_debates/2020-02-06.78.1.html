        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and the Acting Minister for Agriculture: Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the Morrison Government is managing the coronavirus outbreak to ensure Australians are safe and that our agricultural and biosecurity reputation is protected?

         I thank the member for Nicholls for his very serious question. This government's biosecurity measures play a critical role at our borders, and none more critical than for the agricultural industry. We want to make sure that agriculture is a $100 billion industry by 2030, and we're working towards that. Our measures include protecting Australians from the coronavirus. We are working hard around the clock to minimise the impacts this outbreak may have on our nation.

          No, Deputy Prime Minister; if you could just return to the question. I heard the interjection. It's hard when you're answering a question, but it didn't have that motive about it. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.

           Small minds, Mr Speaker. Australia is well-placed to respond to travellers who may be at risk of contracting infection, with border isolation surveillance and contact-tracing mechanisms already in place. Our actions have been swift, they've been appropriate, they've been calm, they've been measured. Temporary travel restrictions have been introduced for foreign nationals seeking to enter Australia within 14 days of departing or transiting through mainland China. Protection measures relating to both aviation and maritime passenger arrivals, including crew members, have been put in place.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to aviation, all airlines flying to Australia are incorporating into their mandatory passenger announcements a specific health announcement from the Australian government regarding the coronavirus. This broadcast is made on board before the aircraft lands, with similar announcements being made at sea ports. I'm aware that Qantas and Chinese airlines have suspended or are suspending services to China, and I invite those passengers impacted to contact airlines in the first instance in relation to future travel plans.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to those evacuated in the assisted departure from Wuhan, 241 passengers have been transferred to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Christmas Island
           </a>
           for quarantine. Again I say this: it's a calm, considered approach. That's what this government does in relation to all of these things, and most importantly to protecting our borders. I'd like to thank Qantas for its assistance at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
           In maritime, our focus is on providing information to assist the protection of marine pilots, stevedores and harbour masters. I appreciate the fact that unions have been taking part in discussions between departments for these critical interventions. We're working hard to minimise the impact on our shipping trade, bearing in mind that 80 per cent of the value of Australia's trade is moved by ship.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our agricultural biosecurity is absolutely paramount. Managing maritime aspects of travel restrictions are twofold: managing cargo vessels and managing cruise ships. All international vessels entering Australia are required to report information about biosecurity before they arrive. I say again: our response has been considered, it's been measured, it's been appropriate and it's been swift.
