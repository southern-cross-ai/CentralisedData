       <p class="italic">
        (1)   notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   the inaugural international parliamentary conference on 'Parliaments, minorities and Indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics' was held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuxtla_Gutierrez" rel="nofollow">
         Tuxtla Gutierrez
        </a>
        , Chiapas, Mexico from 31 October to 3 November 2010;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   the conference was organised jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>

        </a>
        ;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)   the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of discrimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of poverty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, including at the level of the national parliament;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d)   the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a 'plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e)   the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the 'plans of action':
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)   ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legislative and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)   require of government that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and Indigenous peoples;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii)   make regular use of plenary sessions in parliament and other parliamentary fora to discuss minority/Indigenous matters in order to raise awareness and combat prejudice in society, organise awareness-raising sessions for all parliamentarians so as to increase their knowledge of minorities and Indigenous peoples and the particular problems they face, and ensure that minority and Indigenous issues are mainstreamed into parliamentary work, especially at the committee level;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv)   allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parliamentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v)   increase parliaments' familiarity with work being done within the United Nations system so as to equip them better to hold governments to account for their international commitments, including the achievement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        , urge ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, hold debates in parliament on the conclusions and recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special mechanisms with regard to minority and Indigenous peoples' rights;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f)   the Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and Indigenous peoples, and address their concerns in their party programs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g)   the IPU will facilitate networking among parliaments on this issue, monitor the implementation of the Chiapas Declaration and convene a follow-up meeting within two years to discuss progress and set targets for future action;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)   urges the Government, parliamentarians, and political parties to familiarise themselves with the Chiapas Declaration; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3)   calls upon the Government to facilitate a roundtable discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. (Notice given 19 June 2012.)
