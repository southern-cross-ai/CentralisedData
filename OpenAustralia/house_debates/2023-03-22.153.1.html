       <p>
        This past weekend, we saw confronting sights on the streets of the city I love. Melbourne and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Spring Street
        </a>
        were filled with anti-trans activists who were supported by a squad of hooded Neo-Nazis giving Nazi salutes. Both of these groups turned up to spread hate and vilify minorities through their dark ideologies. But, from these ugly scenes, we are presented with an opportunity to come together, to send a different message and to take action. We've seen incredible responses from governments and communities across the country. The leadership from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of Victoria
        </a>
        has been exemplary. I acknowledge today and over the last couple of days the strong statements by our Prime Minister, and I acknowledge the statements of condemnation by the Leader of the Opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership of John Pesutto, the Victorian Leader of the Opposition. He understands that all major political parties should be united against the dark ideologies that we saw on display out the front of the Victorian Parliament House. Mr Pesutto has made the decisive, bold decision to remove a member of his own team. Let me quote for the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        from the motion that the Victorian Liberal leader put to his party room: 'On 19 March 2023 and on days prior, organising, promoting and attending a rally where the principal speaker'—I'm not going to mention her name—'was known to be publicly associated with far right-wing extremist groups, including Neo-Nazi activists.' Let me rephrase that. The Victorian Liberal leader is moving to expel one of his own because of the direct links with far-right extremist groups, including Neo-Nazi activists.
       </p>
       <p>
        The question remains. There are rumours that this very same activist is coming to Canberra tomorrow. Apparently they will be speaking on the lawns of parliament, and apparently they will be joined by members of the opposition. I say this sincerely: I really hope that the Leader of the Opposition upholds the same standard for his team that the Victorian Liberal leader does for the Victorian Liberal team. At the moment, we've had public statements from Senators Canavan, Chandler, Antic and Price for this particular individual who the Victorian Liberal leader has said to his own party has direct links with extremists and with Neo-Nazis. We even have a member of the shadow cabinet intervening in this process. It is not me saying this; it is the Victorian Liberal leader.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to the members of this House and the members of the Senate: think about what happened in Melbourne on the weekend. Think about the scenes. Think about the week that we have just had. Think about the message that you send by standing alongside this particular activist. The Victorian Liberal leader has thought about that. He has thought about those consequences, and he has moved to remove one of his own members. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to all those opposite that I believe that the intent to show unity from this weekend's activities is real. But I hope that the federal Liberal Party can do what the Victorian Liberal Party is doing and stand up to these activists who have marched alongside and have known links to far-right neo-Nazi activists. This place should be united. I hope we see the best of this place, and I hope we all stand together to say that all Australians deserve acceptance, deserve a sense of community and deserve to be free from discrimination and bigotry.
