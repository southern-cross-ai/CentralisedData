        Sixteen Tasmanians were recognised in this year's

        honours list for outstanding service. I would like to mention two people from my electorate of Bass who received awards. Mrs Margaret East was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her service to the performing arts. Mrs East has given long and valuable service to the Launceston Competitions, having been the organisation's secretary for the past 35 years. What a marvellous achievement. I know that many talented young people have benefited from participating in the Launceston Competitions who greatly value her experience and mentoring. Mrs East has also been involved with the Tasmanian National Dancing Association and Tasmanian State Committee of Highland Dancing. Mr Mervin Whybrow was also awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for serving the Launceston community, principally through his long membership with the City of Launceston Lions Club. As a member of the Riverside Lions Club, I know what value that these Lions of our community can bring to worthy causes. Mr Whybrow has also given wonderful service to other organisations, like the

        , the

        </a>
        , the Low Head Progress and Heritage Association committee and the Low Head Pilot Station Support Group. It is wonderful to see people like Mrs East and Mr Whybrow recognised in this way. I congratulate them and all of the other Tasmanians on this year's Queen's Birthday honours list.
