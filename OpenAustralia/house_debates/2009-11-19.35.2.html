       <p>
        I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4247" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation (Water Entitlements) Bill 2009-2010

        . I acknowledge the comments from my good friend the member for Riverina but note that in this my own portfolio I have seen the effect of the water savings in relation to the impact on environmental aspects to do with our river and wetlands issues in the Murray-Darling Basin. I just recently visited the Hata lakes with the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Water, Senator Wong, and saw the recovery of that area and the great benefits obtained from that for the environment and tourism. There is a balance to be achieved here and we are working towards that. We have the four aspects of policy that we are pursuing: tackling the issue of climate change primarily, working towards securing our water future, using water wisely and restoring health to our rivers. These measures are directed at achieving that. Certainly, in my own electorate of Eden Monaro, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_River" rel="nofollow">
         Snowy River
        </a>
        being such a critical issue, we are directing great resources to achieving the health of that river for the benefit of our community and our economy. It is about achieving that balance and this legislation will assist us to accelerate that effort.

        is required to provide urgent funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Environment
        </a>
        , Water, Heritage and the Arts to accelerate water buybacks within the Murray-Darling Basin system. The objective of the Restoring the Balance in the Murray-Darling Basin program is to purchase water entitlements to restore the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basin system and to smooth the transition to the lowest sustainable diversion limits anticipated in the new basin plan. To date, the Restoring the Balance in the Murray-Darling Basin program has secured the purchase of more than 600 gigalitres of water entitlements. The funding being brought forward in this bill will enable a further acceleration of environmental water purchasing and provide for new water purchase initiatives in 2009 and 2010. We are purchasing from willing sellers and we are, at the same time, pursuing efficiencies and productivity measures in on-farm and off-farm irrigation infrastructure investment. Getting the balance right is what this government is all about. This bill will help to achieve that objective.
