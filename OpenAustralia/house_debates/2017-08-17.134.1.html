       <p>
        In my electorate last week, I was very proud to host the Newcastle Volunteer Service Awards for the fourth time. This is a great event, which always reminds me just how fantastic the city of Newcastle is and just how many people in our community are genuinely committed to giving back, to ensure that our community is the very best we can be. I also know, from experience, that, despite our increasingly busy lives, the number of Novacastrians who are now volunteering in our community is increasing. This fact is backed up by recent data from the census. In 2011 the census said that 16.2 per cent of Novocastrians undertook volunteering activities. From the census last year, this has grown to almost 19 per cent, and I am really proud to say that this is above both metropolitan and state averages. Newcastle people are really punching above their weight.
       </p>
       <p>
        The awards ceremony this year was the biggest it's ever been. There were close to 200 attendees and over 100 Novocastrians recognised for their service to our community. We had an exceptional field of nominees in the categories of sporting service, school service and community service. People were recognised for an incredible range of activities they undertake in Newcastle. They patrol our beaches. They support our teachers to educate the next generation in our schools. They beautify and maintain our public spaces. They contribute to the rich artistic and cultural life in our city. They provide care and companionship to other Novocastrians. They give up their time to train our young athletes. They raise much-needed funds for community organisations, and some even set up their own community organisations.
       </p>

        This year two fabulous groups were also nominated for awards. The first group was the volunteer team at the Hunter Community Legal Centre, a team of law students and graduates who selflessly give their time and experience so that the centre can provide free legal services to the most disadvantaged in our community. The second group to be recognised was the incredible army of dedicated volunteers who helped save the Birmingham Gardens Regal Cinema from almost certain demise. The cinema's story is a tale of community triumph against the odds. In 2007, it closed down because of council safety concerns and was marked for demolition. It was only saved by the hard-fought community campaign and the extraordinary work of volunteers. All the volunteers who were recognised last week play an important part in enriching our city. I know they don't do it for the recognition or thanks, and some were very embarrassed to be nominated, but they deserved to be.
