        Jewish Board of Deputies, is stepping down after 16 years at the helm. Vic is one of the great men of multiculturalism in Australia and one of our most recognisable and respected community leaders. A few years ago a bipartisan group of MPs rated Vic the most influential community leader in New South Wales. Vic is effective because he is knowledgeable and engaging. He is forthright in putting his case not only in calling out anti-Semitism and defending the state of Israel but also in calling out hatred directed to other groups as well, cognisant of the wisdom of

        Vic has built coalitions across many communities and was the spokesman for the Keep

        Safe campaign, which resulted in reforms to New South Wales laws regarding incitement to violence on the basis of race, religion, gender and sexuality. He spearheaded initiatives to ensure Holocaust education is part of the curriculum. He conducted highly impactful trips to Israel for emerging political leaders, journalists and

        Throughout all of his endeavours he's been supported by his wonderful wife, Nadine, herself a great ambassador for the Jewish community. No doubt the next phase of Vic's life will bring more time for marathons, more time for Nadine and more time for the grandchildren. Vic Alhadeff, we salute you. Kol hakavod!
