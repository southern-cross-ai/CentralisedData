        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities. Will the minister update the House on how the government is delivering on its national economic plan for jobs and growth through infrastructure investment in urban and regional areas, including how it's benefitting my electorate of Fairfax, and is the minister aware of any other strategies?

         I do thank the member for Fairfax for his question. He has a very strong record of delivering for his constituents when it comes to securing infrastructure commitments for his electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've just seen a commitment for $390 million for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail connection. That's been on the drawing board for many years. It took the member for Fairfax, the member for Fisher and Team
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
          LNP
         </a>
         , Team Queensland, to deliver that outcome, because it is the LNP Team Queensland which is delivering infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is the extraordinary range of projects on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         : $831 million for the Bruce Highway Safety Package, $175 million in additional funding for black spots; and the Bruce Highway Upgrade—Caloundra Road to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
          Sunshine Motorway
         </a>
         . In fact, the LNP Team Queensland is delivering commitments of $15.4 billion between 2013-14 and 2021-22. On the M1 between Brisbane and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Coast
         </a>
         there is $500 million for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Mile_Plains" rel="nofollow">
          Eight Mile Plains
         </a>
         to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Hill" rel="nofollow">
          Daisy Hill
         </a>
         and $500 million for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
          Varsity Lakes
         </a>
         to Tugun. That is the LNP Team Queensland delivering. The member for Brisbane has been responsible for delivering a commitment of $300 million for Brisbane Metro, and for Cooroy to Curra, section D, the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Wide Bay
         </a>
         has delivered $800 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, many of the projects are also going to benefit another electorate in Queensland—the electorate of Longman. Indeed, the former member for Longman, before she forgot that she was also a British citizen, was quoted in the
         <i>
          Caboolture Shire Herald
         </i>
         as saying that the Beerburrum to Nambour connection was both welcome and important—and she was absolutely right. Of course, she delivered nothing like the previous LNP member for Longman. Look at what he delivered in terms of mobile base stations, for example: seven base stations in Longman. And, of course, in Fairfax, there were three base stations under the Mobile Black Spot Program.
        </p>
        <p>
         What did we get from Labor when it came to mobile black spots in Longman—or anywhere else? How many dollars did Labor commit? Zero! How much additional coverage did Labor deliver? Zero! How many new towers did Labor deliver? Zero. Triple-zero is a well-known number in telecommunications; it took Labor to turn it into a policy! They're delivering nothing! They're delivering nothing for their constituents. We're delivering; Team LNP is delivering.
