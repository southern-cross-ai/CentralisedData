       <p>
        I rise tonight to advise the House at the passing of Paula Ford of Medowie. Paula was a devoted life partner and best friend of Tom; a loving mother to Andrew, Terry, Sandy and Tom Jr; a wonderful mother-in-law to Kim, Julianna, Glen and Libby; a wonderful Nanna to the apples of her eyes—grandchildren Catherine, Emily, Michael, Samantha, Erin, Leigh, Mitchell and Rhiley; and a sister to Peter, Christopher and Vanessa. Most importantly, Paula Ford was a friend to many. We all know Paula in a different form, but we all know that she put others first. There are talkers and there are doers. Paula was definitely a doer.
       </p>
       <p>
        My first meeting with Tom and Paula was in June 1995, when I ran for preselection for the Liberal Party, when I first heard that distinguishably Paula line: ‘Now listen here, my boy’—and then you would get the sermon from the mount. I listened; I was elected. The world according to Paula: invariably she was right, and it was always for others, for the community that she and Tom loved so much. I believe that the greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand but in what direction we are moving. Paula always moved heaven and earth for her community. No obstacle was too great. Apart from her example to others by being a fine wife, who in partnership with Tom raised a happy family who remain close knit and productive members of society—she instilled in them and in her grandchildren a sense of community spirit—Paula is remembered for many things.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are all aware that one of Tom and Paula’s many legacies is the creation of Pacific Dunes. Many Medowie residents would know Paula from her involvement with that community and for her unflinching support for that development against all the odds. I used to drop in for a cuppa regularly with Tom and Paula at the house on the hill. I saw the vision and passion first-hand. Tom could never say no to a challenge, and Paula always made sure it was followed through.
       </p>
       <p>
        Support for the community was not a newfound thing for Tom and Paula. Some may have forgotten in the passage of time the donation to the

        while Tom was in Apex. Winston Churchill said: ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.’ Funny, Tom would make the commitment and, again, Paula would follow through, but they always gave their all. Paula was involved in

        , soccer and youth issues and she was a vital member of the Medowie Probus club.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no secret that Paula supported the Grahamstown Dam Sailing and Aquatic Club and, with Rotary, purchased dinghies for Sailability. More recently a dinghy was donated in her name. Unfortunately she was not well enough to christen the boat, but her grandchildren did her proud that day. They definitely follow in Paula’s footsteps.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many would not know that, if it were not for Tom and Paula Ford, the release of the dam for broader community use would never have happened. My involvement in having the dam as a community asset came as a councillor on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        following yet another sermon on the mount from Paula. Paula and Tom were relentless in advocating that young kids had nothing to do and here was a dam that no-one could use. The rest is history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paula was a tireless worker for her beloved community and in spite of, not because of, her own battles with breast cancer she was a champion for raising awareness of and fundraising for breast cancer research. She even got me to participate in Relay for Life though I must admit I paid others to walk the kilometres for me.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is indicative of her local community spirit that she wanted her friends not to mourn her passing but to celebrate her life, knowing that each of them was a part of that journey of life. Finally, to quote

        Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
