        I rise this morning to recognise the historic result in last month’s referendum in Sudan, which almost unanimously supported an independent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan" rel="nofollow">
         South Sudan
        </a>
        . After decades of social and political turmoil, this is a momentous leap forward for the Sudanese people. In the words of United Nations Secretary-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki_Moon" rel="nofollow">
         Ban Ki Moon
        </a>
        , the ‘peaceful and credible conduct of the referendum is a great achievement for all Sudanese’.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate of Greenway is home to thousands of Sudanese people who now call Australia home. One of my greatest pleasures as a member of parliament and previously as a councillor and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Mayor
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blacktown City Council
        </a>
        is our great citizenship ceremonies which regularly comprise a large number of proud Sudanese born people who have chosen to call Australia home. Our area is enriched by the contribution the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Sudanese Australian
        </a>
        community make and I join with them in celebrating the historic result of this recent referendum.
       </p>
       <p>
        One local resident, Faustino Aboka, who came to Australia in 2000, recently told the
        <i>
         Blacktown Sun
        </i>
        that his family and friends had been hoping and praying for independence for many years. Faustino also acknowledged the experiences he and his family have had in Australia and outlined that the Sudanese community in Blacktown will use their Australian knowledge and experience to help the new nation get on its feet. Mr Aboka and his wife, Savia, are proud Sudanese Australians. They are so proud that they recently named their firstborn daughter Julia after our Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that South Sudan can prosper and remain a safe and productive nation, the Australian government must have an active role in the development of this young nation. The Australian government has therefore announced $9 million to assist in this development process. The funds will be used in the period directly after the referendum to help provide health, education and other essential services specifically to ensure that women and children are taken care of. This commitment by the Australian government is in addition to the $113 million already given to South Sudan in humanitarian assistance since 2004.
       </p>
       <p>
        I once again congratulate the people of South Sudan for gaining their independence. I look forward to hearing about the good work being done by the government in this new phase of Sudanese history. I commit myself to continuing to work with our local Sudanese settlement support services in Blacktown to enhance the lives of these great Australians.
