        I would like to recognise the work of

        ,

        , a local Indigenous artist from Yamba. Uncle Joe's artwork was used by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sydney_Rabbitohs" rel="nofollow">
         South Sydney Rabbitohs
        </a>
        for their jersey for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        Indigenous round this year. The jersey design focused on the Rabbitoh in the middle of the chest. It had handprints of all the current Aboriginal players and also acknowledged their heritage by displaying totems. The totems represented where each player was from. The design then connected the totems to the central Rabbitoh, which represented all their journeys going to the club. Uncle Joe said that seeing them run out in the jersey was a very special moment.

        Uncle Joe was born in Casino and grew up at the Tabulam Aboriginal Reserve with his seven siblings. He is a proud Bundjalung man and played for the Tabulam Turtle Divers. He currently works with Ngunya Jarjum, teaching art to young people. One of the players this year who wore the jersey was Uncle Joe's nephew

Theo, I know your family—your mum Connie, Wayne, Trevor, Ali, Dominic, Sebastian, Kyle and Tyrese are extremely proud of you. Congratulation and thank you for what you do in our community.

        I would like to recognise 14-year-old Harley Walters, a young surfer from Angourie. This year, Harley has won the under-16 Surfing New South Wales Junior State Title. The surfing state title is a massive achievement for Harley. He outperformed older and more experienced surfers and the win was certainly no easy feat. Harley's older brother Dakoda is also one of the best young surfers in Australia also. Harley's win proved that he is much more than just Dakoda's little brother. Congratulations on the win, Harley, and I look forward to seeing you and Dakoda continue to excel.
