        Before I begin, I'd like to thank San Sisto year 10 student Isabelle Bounds, who wrote my speech today during some work experience in my electorate office.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to share with the chamber the immense success of the Bonner Youth Advisory Council, BYAC, in 2020. BYAC was launched earlier this year, inviting high school students to share their views and opinions on the issues important to them. The program gave young people a platform to be heard and learn more about the inner workings of parliament. BYAC provides insight into the role of their government and how it works in with the community and outlines a clear path as to how they can get more involved to help influence change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given this year's BYAC success, in addition to continuing this program in 2021 we will also be starting a junior BYAC for primary school students. This will provide younger students in Bonner with the opportunity to demonstrate and grow their leadership skills, and a voice to be heard by their peers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our first BYAC zoom was joined by my Brisbane colleague,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Evans" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who provided fascinating insight into how our government is combating waste and working towards improving recycling methods. We got some great questions regarding how the government was improving recycling in Australia and the future policies around waste reduction.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our final BYAC zoom of 2020, guest speaker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Thompson
        </a>
        joined us and spoke about his journey from infantryman to parliamentarian. The message of his speech really resonated with students, with the words 'taking the hard right instead of the easy wrong', as he spoke of leadership and taking action for what you believe in. Students asked further questions around mental health and how they could reach out to those in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, the Bonner Youth Advisory Council gave students the opportunity to be a voice for change in their community. I look forward to continuing this great program in 2021, with the addition of a junior council.
