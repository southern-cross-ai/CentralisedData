       <p>
        I'm a proud supporter of the local sporting clubs in my electorate of Bonner. I rise today to share how the Morrison government's Powering Communities initiative has successfully delivered for the Mt Gravatt Vultures Australian Football Club, who are now enjoying the benefits of the $12,000 in funding they were awarded. Over the years, I've had the privilege of supporting the club with funding for several projects to upgrade their facilities at Dittmer Park, including night lighting, field irrigation systems and construction of coaching boxes and spectator facilities. With energy bills often being one of the biggest overheads for not-for-profit organisations, this funding was put towards the installation of solar panels to support the club's endeavours to become more sustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        President of the Mt Gravatt Vultures, Daryl Guilford, recently let me know of the completed installation, and expressed the club's sincere appreciation for the funding. Daryl mentioned the panels are already providing major benefits by reducing the power bills. This relieves financial pressure so the club can further invest in its growing football program, with over 600 male and female players. In even more great news, these savings can go towards purchasing equipment like balls and training bibs, as well as facilities improvements that not only benefit players but spectators as well. This forms part of the club's goal for 2022 and beyond, providing a great community club that welcomes all players, volunteers and spectators to an environment that they feel part of.
