        My question is to the Prime Minister. On
        <i>
         Insiders
        </i>
        recently, when asked about establishing a makarrata commission with responsibility for truth-telling, the Prime Minister said, 'Well, that's not what we've proposed.' But on election night 2022 the Prime Minister promised to implement the Uluru statement in full—Voice, truth-telling and treaty—and he repeated that promise on more than 34 occasions. Why does this tricky Prime Minister repeatedly promise one thing and do another?

         I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. The theme of this year's festival at Garma—which was broadcast even if you weren't there and even if there wasn't anyone from the coalition who made the effort to sit down and engage—was 'Fire, strength, and renewal'—strength and commitment from

         people to deal with the trauma that many of them feel from the defeat of the referendum, which is very real. Regardless of where you stood on that issue, I would have thought that it would be appropriate to have some respect for the family of Yunupingu. Djawa, who has taken over the leadership of the Yolngu people, is the brother of Yunupingu, who was farewelled just a year ago—a great Indigenous leader and someone who was responsible, probably more than anyone else, for the Uluru Statement from the Heart.

         What we did there was to acknowledge, as the incoming minister has done, the need to reach out—

          It's going to be difficult to take a point of order on relevance here. The Prime Minister is framing his answer, obviously. around where he made the statements. Anyway, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.

            I won't be accurate about where the statements were made, but I'm assuming the Prime Minister would know where he made the statements, which was at the festival, on the interview. But he can explain it to the House. He should just make sure his comments, when he's talking about his position and about the policy topic, are being directly relevant. We'll make sure that he continues on that standing order.
