       <p>
        Last night, the Treasurer handed down a wonderful budget, one that is underpinned by three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        , or Liberal Party, core philosophies—fairness, opportunity and security. One of the most important things that my electorate have been telling me since I was elected in July of last year is that they need, and demand, better infrastructure on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        . I was very pleased to see that, last night, the federal government delivered in spades on that very issue: $530 million for priority upgrades between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_River" rel="nofollow">
         Pine River
        </a>
        bridge and the Caloundra interchange, and a $120 million upgrade to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Deception Bay
        </a>
        interchange. That is $650 million on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        that will go directly to assisting Sunshine Coast locals driving to work in Brisbane and driving home at night. These much-needed infrastructure upgrades are an absolute godsend to many locals who spend hours in what we call the Bruce car park.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it does not stop just there. There is $182.6 million in targeted safety upgrades up and down the Bruce Highway. That is on top of the almost $1 billion that this federal government is spending on Bruce Highway upgrades between Caloundra Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Motorway
        </a>
        . This is an absolutely unprecedented amount that the federal government is spending on the Sunshine Coast. The $530 million and $120 million upgrades to the Bruce Highway are part of a package—a package that cannot be implemented until the Queensland state Labor government gets off its backside and implements and completes a planning study that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bailey" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Bailey
        </a>
        has been sitting on for such a very long time. For about the sixth time, I now call upon him—again—to release that planning study. Let's get it out and let's get this highway upgraded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great advantage of an announcement from last night is a $10 billion national rail program to fund transformational rail projects between cities and regions—regions like the coast. That is $10 billion that the state Labor government can access to fund the duplication of the railway line. This is a great project. It is identified by Queensland, built in Queensland. It needs to be funded.
