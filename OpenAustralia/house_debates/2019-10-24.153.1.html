        The Morrison government is continuing to deliver for all Australians, especially those in my electorate of Petrie. By living within our means and getting the budget back into the black, we're able to deliver on local projects that communities desperately need.

        I'm pleased to have been able to advocate for the people of Aspley in the south of my electorate and the

        </a>
        , and this weekend I'll officially be opening the new federal government funded playground at Aspley East Kindergarten. Marie and the team do such an amazing job at the kindy and support so many local children to learn and play in order to reach their full potential, giving them the best start to life in their early education. When the team at Aspley kindy approached me last year and total me about the desperate need for a new playground, I was able to go down, have a look and ask parents to put together a petition. We were able to get funding for it, which is just fantastic. I secured $100,000 for the Aspley kindergarten, which has now been able to remove the older playground, which was nearly two decades old, and replace it with brand new equipment to suit the play based development of the children at the kindy. It's great for the children and the community of Aspley to have this on offer locally to support the development of children. I'm looking forward to opening that this weekend.

        And it's not the only development for the people of Aspley and other suburbs around that area like Castledine, Fitzgibbon and Bridgeman Downs. I'm also pleased that I've been able to secure, with the help of the Aspley Memorial Bowls Club, over half a million dollars to ensure they realise their dream of putting a cover over green 1. The Aspley bowls club have been there for many years. They're not a wealthy club. They don't have poker machines and so forth. They're senior Australians, and younger people as well, who are actively playing bowls every week. We know how important it is to stay active from a young age right through to the senior years. I worked alongside the member for Dickson to ensure a grant of $590,000 went to the Aspley bowls club to build the shade over the green. Next week I'll be visiting the club to officially open it and have a game with the locals. I will look at it firsthand and see how it is helping locals. I invite the community—those people in the streets nearby in Carseldine, even if they don't play bowls—to come along and look at the shade cover and see how this will add to the community as a whole.
