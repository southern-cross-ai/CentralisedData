       <p>
        My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the enormous impact of the increasing cost of fuel on the farm sector and, in particular, the quadrupling of prices for chemicals and fertilisers? What action is the government proposing to take to reduce these fundamental input costs for the producers of food and fibre in this country?

        <p>
         The farm sector in Australia is doing it particularly tough because of the impact of oil prices and petrol prices. I again draw the attention of those from the farm sector who are listening to the broadcast to one important fact which is of direct relevance to the farm sector—that is, the future of Australia’s wheat industry. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Liberal Party of Australia
         </a>
         voted with the

          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         , this government, to pass the new arrangements for the export of Australian wheat, and the National Party opposed. It is very important that some of those opposite do not wish to debate or discuss this—they are split right down the middle on the future of this critical $4 billion export crop. It should be placed on the record that the Liberals voted with Labor against the Nationals on this reform for the future.

         The second point is this—

         <p>
          On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the question was specific. It was about the impact of the rising cost of fuel and, particularly, fertiliser on Australian farmers. The Prime Minister is not answering the question he was asked.

            In our discussions with farm organisations, not only have they been concerned about the future of the wheat export industry; they are concerned also about their farm input costs. They are concerned about the cost of fuel. They are concerned about the cost of fertilisers. I have some news for those opposite. These concerns did not mysteriously materialise on 3 December last year. In my own discussions with representatives of the farm sector in recent years—

              The honourable member for Riverina will know this full well—the representations that all of us have received is that the cost of fertiliser has been ballooning for not just many weeks, for not just many months but for many years. It is a huge impact on the overall cost structure of farmers out there who are doing it tough, trying to earn a living off the land at a time of enormous change. In particular, the change is affecting rural Australia coming off the worst drought in the century and the rolling impact of water.

That may be disconcerting to those opposite, to all those Liberal Party members in regional areas who voted with the Labor government to change the single desk—I know it is painful for that to be said—but my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been in active consultation with rural organisations about their cost structures and, furthermore, about the future of the farm sector.
