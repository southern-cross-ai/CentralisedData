       <p>
        I present a petition from Monica Parker as the principal petitioner on behalf of holders of temporary retirement visas subclass 410 requesting a pathway to become permanent residents and citizens. The petitioners cite the following reasons in support of favourable consideration. They have resided in Australia continuously for at least 10 years, are home owners, are self-funded retirees with overseas sourced pensions, are law abiding, contribute significantly and voluntarily to the community, have private health insurance, have injected millions of dollars into the Australian economy and would, as permanent residents, pay income tax in Australia on overseas income.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2007 the government commissioned a report into the potential direct costs to the Commonwealth of granting permanent residency to this group of visa holders. The modelling was prepared by the Australian Government Actuary and finalised based on the population of visa holders as at 30 June 2010. It included seven alternative scenarios with slightly different assumptions in relation to health costs, inflation and mortality rates. The cost projections of health care, aged care and income support under these scenarios ranged from $815 million to $1.42 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have met with a number of representatives, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Goodall" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Humphries" rel="nofollow">
         David Humphries
        </a>
        , advocating on behalf of 410 visa holders who have articulated that a number of pertinent factors were omitted from the actuarial modelling contained in the 38-page report. These factors include: the economic benefit of assets and foreign income brought into Australia; the projected increase in taxation revenue that will be generated from investments and superannuation brought onshore; and the contribution to Australian society through volunteering and family support such as child care. The number of visa holders has progressively declined over the past five years. As at 30 June 2013, there were an estimated 5,572 individuals on category 410 visas. Of these, only 3,323 were resident onshore. By comparison, the 2010 report was based on 7,215 cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the abovementioned factors, I make the case for the government to commission a fresh review into the costs and benefits of granting permanent residency to holders of 410 visas with more robust terms of reference and comprehensive actuarial modelling to reflect changes in the circumstances.
       </p>

         The petition read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of 410 Visa holders residents in Australia draws to the attention of the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That 3000 self-funded individuals that call Australia home are currently prevented from becoming Australian citizens. A motion proposed by Senator Chris Ellison and agreed by the Senate on 28 June 2008 should be upheld by the government to 'enable temporary resident retirement 410 visa holders to apply for permanent residency'. Also in 2008 Senator Chris Evans then Minister for Immigration, declared that 'if people choose to make their lives in Australia they should have a pathway to citizenship open to them'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Surely 3000 retirement visa holders of whom we estimate no more than 2000 would take up Permanent Residence if offered deserve security in the knowledge that they have certainty, particularly all who:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Allow all holders of the Temporary Retirement Visa (sub-class 410) who have resided in Australia for a continuous period of 10 years or more the right to become Permanent Residents and Citizens..
