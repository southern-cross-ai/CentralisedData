        I rise to share with the House the inspirational story of Nathan Connor, a student at Wyong High School in the Dobell electorate. Nathan and his brother, Mitchell, tragically lost their mother to cancer in 2013. Reflecting upon his loss, Nathan said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cancer is one of those things you know is there and you hear stories everyday about people being diagnosed with cancer â€¦ but it is never something you think will ever affect you or your loved ones. Even through this whole fight, I still never thought it would ever come to the moment we were faced with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inspired by their loss, Nathan and Mitchell undertook a 219 kilometre bicycle ride to raise money for cancer research. Along with their teacher Mr Mick Sugitha, they raised $7,500 in a short amount of time and participated in the Sunsuper Ride to Conquer Cancer. Held on 11 and 12 October, the ride through the

        benefits the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, a world-class integrated cancer treatment centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to Nathan's dedication and commitment to this worthy cause, he is also a strong role model for the youth of the

        . Nathan recently participated in Wyong Shire Council's youth mock council and is an enthusiastic member of the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a recent meeting of the committee, Nathan shared with us his willingness to be a champion for student mental wellbeing at Wyong High School and to support his fellow students who may be experiencing a difficult time. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know young Nathan over recent months, and I am proud to share his willingness to help others with this parliament.
