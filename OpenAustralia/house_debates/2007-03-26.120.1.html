        Earlier today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question to do with a member’s declaration of interests. A resolution of the House sets out the requirements in respect of the declaration of members’ interests. This resolution requires that, at the commencement of each parliament and at other times as necessary, the Speaker shall appoint an officer of the Department of the House of Representatives as the Registrar of Members’ Interests. That officer also serves as Secretary to the Committee of Members’ Interests. Apart from appointing the registrar, as Speaker I have no role in respect of members’ declarations.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence, following the matter you referred to being raised with me by journalists over the weekend and again in the House after question time today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I have made inquiries and obtained detailed advice from my wife’s accountant and legal advisers. I have discussed the matter with the registrar and informed him of the details of the advice I received. In light of the advice provided to me and my discussions with the registrar, I am confident in assuring the House that I have acted with propriety at all stages in this matter.

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence, it appears this was at worst a potential minor breach of the pecuniary interest register. The purpose of my question to you today was to confirm that technical compliance, if needed, had now occurred. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has so assured the House and I am satisfied that the minister has fully complied with the requirements of the House.
