        Yesterday I was lucky enough to attend the first ever Rotary duck race and water festival at Shorncliffe on the banks of Cabbage Tree Creek. With the rainy weather it was a very good day for ducks, but nonetheless it was a fantastic day for families and it was a brilliant way to raise funds in support of Hummingbird House, a joint initiative of Queensland Kids and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Mission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at Chermside to build and operate Queensland's first and only children's hospice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year I had the privilege of attending the sod turning of Hummingbird House, and it was inspirational and moving to hear from the co-founders of Queensland Kids, Paul and Gabrielle Quilliam, on their experience as parents of chronically ill children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to extend my congratulations to the Rotary clubs of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Airport
        </a>
        , Geebung, Hamilton, Nundah and Sandgate on organising such a fantastic day for such a worthy cause. In particular, I would like to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Ray" rel="nofollow">
         Diane Ray
        </a>
        , president of Sandgate Rotary; the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        ; Thomas Grice and the volunteer Marine Rescue; the Sandgate Canoe Club; the Sandgate Yacht Club; and the Sandgate Police, for their support of the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second event that I would like to update the house on is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        1 Queenslander Challenge, which aims to raise money in support of Mates4Mates. I was honoured to participate in the trek on 23 May, which begins at Enoggera Reservoir and proceeds through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Aguilar_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         D'Aguilar National Park
        </a>
        , finishing at the Woodford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I issued the challenge in this place a few weeks ago for more politicians to get involved with this great cause. I am happy to say that on the north side we have put together a great team of Dr Anthony Lynham, Leanne Linard, Stirling Hinchcliffe, Councillor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Newton" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Newton
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Chisholm" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Chisholm
        </a>
        . For anyone looking to get involved there is an information session on 2 July at 6 pm at the Kedron-Wavell RSL, and I urge people to get involved with this great cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate and acknowledge one of the members of that team, my good friend Councillor Victoria Newton, who has announced that she will be retiring at the end of her current term. Since her election in 2000, she has been a very strong voice for the community, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Getting involved at the local level with local RSLs, local environment groups, and particularly with community service groups such as Rotary, is one of the most important things that a member of parliament can do. In particular, we have the Einbunpin Festival coming up in Sandgate next month where all of the community groups will be there talking to the community about the services that they can provide. This is the essence of a strong community: strong service organisations who are there to provide a voice for our community. I am proud to be associated in particular with what Rotary has done on the north side, and what Victoria Newton, our councillor, and so many other dedicated volunteers in our community have done.
