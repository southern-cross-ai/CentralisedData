        Ivan Heazlewood, from Heazlewood's Lane at Whitemore in the north of my electorate of Lyons, has been an innovator in many agricultural fields, including cattle breeding and seed production. But it has been his work in maintaining and developing the stud British sheep breeds in Tasmania that sets this third-generation Whitemore farmer above the rest. His efforts were acknowledged when Mr Heazlewood, now in his 90th year, was made a Member of the Order of Australia on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Heazlewood has served as a committee member of the Tasmanian branch of the Australian society of breeders of British sheep since 1960. He says that his passion for sheep and the people associated with the animals comes from being part of a family that has been breeding and showing sheep—including English Leicesters, Border Leicesters and Poll Dorsets—for more than 140 years. He has earned life membership of the Australian sheep breeders association, English Leicester Association and the Australian society of British sheep breeders as well as many others. He has been an industry leader in other areas, including serving as chairman of the Tasmanian pea growers, cereals and small seed and Tasmanian ryegrass marketing association.

        Mr Heazlewood has become well known nationally for his writings on the animals and people associated with his beloved British sheep breeds. His two main publications have been
        <i>
         Old sheep for new pastures
        </i>
        , published in 1992, and
        <i>
         From the sheep pen
        </i>
        , published in 2012.
        <i>
         From the sheep pen
        </i>
        was a compilation of the best of many short articles he had written over more than 20 years for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_British" rel="nofollow">

        sheep breeders society's publications several times a year. He is officially retired but still takes responsibility for nine lambs which he is preparing for a showing career.
