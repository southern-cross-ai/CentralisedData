       <p>
        This Sunday marks two years since the Prime Minister and his Attorney-General belatedly, grudgingly announced to Australians they would establish a National Integrity Commission. But, two years on, that national anti-corruption commission that the Prime Minister promised Australians is still nowhere in sight. Like so many actions by this government, it is now clear the announcement two years ago was not a policy initiative but a marketing stunt. Indeed, in the two years since that marketing stunt, this Prime Minister has made it clear by his inaction that he's okay with the unlawful use of over $100 million of sports grants money as a Liberal Party re-election slush fund. This Prime Minister is okay with conduct by the Acting Minister for Immigration, Mr Tudge, that Federal Court judges described as both 'disgraceful' and 'criminal'. He's okay with paying more than $30 million for land that's worth a tenth of that. He's okay with the minister for energy sending forged documents to journalists. The ever-growing list of scandals surrounding the Morrison government shows why Australia needs a powerful, independent and transparent National Integrity Commission and why Mr Morrison and his Attorney-General will do everything in their power to prevent one from being established.
