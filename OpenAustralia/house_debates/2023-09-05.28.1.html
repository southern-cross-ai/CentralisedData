       <p>
        I rise today a proud member of the Albanese Labor government, a government that is working for Australia, a government that hasn't wasted a minute since we were elected, a government that's delivering for the people of my community, the members of the community in the electorate of Lalor. From Werribee,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoppers_Crossing" rel="nofollow">
         Hoppers Crossing
        </a>
        to Tarneit, everyone in my community is celebrating a Labor government, because we are delivering for them. We came back to this parliament and put in place measures to ensure that their energy costs didn't go sky high. What did those opposite do? They voted against those measures. There's a theme here. There is a theme that is being established since the Albanese Labor government came to office—that we work hard for Australia, saying yes and doing things that other people say yes to, but we cannot get those opposite to say yes to anything much. All they want to do is say no—no to helping with cost-of-living pressures. They said no. They voted against measures that would mean energy costs staying down for locals that I represent in this place. They didn't want to support the childcare changes until the last minute. They don't want to support the industrial relations changes today that, in my electorate, would mean money in pockets for families.
