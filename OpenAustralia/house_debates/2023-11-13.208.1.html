        What a fantastic Sunday we had across the country when Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities gathered together to celebrate the auspicious festival of lights known by many names including Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar. This festive season is a time of profound significance and joy for over a billion people across the world. It marks the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The festival is marked by people gathering together and sharing food and sweets to express their love and respect for one another. As many in our communities illuminate their homes with diyas and vibrant decorations, they also illuminate their hearts with hope and positivity. These celebrations not only add vibrancy to our society but also serve as reminders of the values we collectively cherishâ€”values of unity, diversity and respect. As I wish the Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities a happy Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar, I also affirm our nation's commitment to fostering understanding and unity among all communities that call Australia home. Once again, from the bottom of my heart, I would like to wish every single person that is celebrating Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar a happy Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar.

         Namaste. I rise to also speak about the Indian festival Deepavali, also known as Diwali. Diwali celebrates the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. The religious significance of the five-day Diwali festival varies regionally within India. It is not limited to any one narrative. It is a celebration of the diversity, beliefs and traditions within the Indian community. This diversity is what makes the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Indian culture so rich and so vibrant. More than 680,000 people follow

         . They contribute immensely to the cultural, social and economic fabric of our nation. I must say our Indian community bring so much light, colour and entertainment and make Australia the greatest nation on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, the festival of lights is celebrated by increasing numbers of Australians from all backgrounds across the nation. Already small to large institutions and businesses allow their employees to take a cultural holiday for Diwali, and I hope to see this accepted in future workplaces, where businesses are allowed to work with their employees to make it happen. I recently had the great honour of joining the member for Dickson, the opposition leader, for his first Indian trip as apposition leader. Again, I thank the Indian community in India for their great hospitality. Finally, I very much look forward to an India-Australia World Cup final. Go Australia.
