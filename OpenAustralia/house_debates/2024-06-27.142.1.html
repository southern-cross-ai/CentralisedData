       <p>
        Earlier this week, I received in Canberra a delegation from the Assyrian National Council, well known to the member for Werriwa and others in this place. They brought with them an international guest, Mr Ron Susek, author of the book
        <i>

        <i>

        </i>
        <i>
         Prophecy
        </i>
        . It was a good opportunity for them to talk about the latest issues of the Assyrian National Council with two ministers, Minister Andrew Giles and Assistant Minister Tim Watts. I was very pleased to arrange that meeting for them to see Minister Giles and Assistant Minister Watts. They raised matters of common occurrence in this House—matters that have been raised by me, the member for Werriwa and others over many years—but they particularly wanted to ensure that any Australian aid flowing to Iraq flows to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian people
        </a>
        . We had a good conversation about those issues, and it was an opportunity for Minister Watts to chase those up. And there was, of course, an excellent and important conversation with Minister Giles, who's no stranger to the Assyrian community. He's met with them several times about settlement and immigration matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was one particular case that was raised with me, and this is one of thousands of cases that the Assyrian people have had to deal with. But, given just how recent this one is, I will bring it to the attention of the House. On 12 March this year, a 20-year-old university student, Ayla Ziton, was kidnapped by militants when she was on the way to visit a friend in her neighbourhood. She's a university student. She has not been able to go to university for some time, given the harassment by groups in Iraq. This woman has now been kidnapped and not seen. This young woman, 20 years old, has not been seen since 12 March. Her family has faced repeated attacks from militants in the past, including physical confrontation and violent incidents. In response to these threats, they've had to sell their property and leave their home, and the kidnapping of their daughter is just the latest thing this family has had to go through. I have a 19-year-old daughter. I can only just begin to imagine what this family is going through.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is appropriate that here in the other side of the world—under no illusions that the militants who have kidnapped her are watching—her case should be brought to the attention of democracies around the world, and we should be putting pressure on. I've raised it with the assistant minister and I will write to him formally, asking for the Australian government to make representations to ensure that everything possible can be done, and I know he will do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is just the latest example in thousands of years of what the Assyrian people have had to go through and continue to go through, as we discussed with Mr Susek. It is appropriate to bring this issue to the House's attention.

        people need to know that, when they are going through things like this—the kidnapping of a 20-year-old girl—they have friends, supporters and family right around the world, and that includes in the
