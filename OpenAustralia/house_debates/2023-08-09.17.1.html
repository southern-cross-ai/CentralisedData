        The customs tariff proposal that I have tabled inserts new item 59 into schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The new concessional item provides a free rate of customs duty to certain goods that are for use in connection with an international sporting event. Eligible goods and relevant sporting events for which they are imported will be prescribed by by-law. The concessional item will facilitate duty-free treatment for goods that are imported for use in connection with the 2023

       <p>
        The Australian government will continue to support major sporting events hosted in Australia, such as the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. We will continue to provide financial investment where possible to support the delivery of events and legacy initiatives. Our country will continue to work with the event owners and organisers to support the safe and successful delivery of events that leave a long-lasting legacy and deliver socio-economic outcomes for the Australian community. Deputy Speaker Freelander, I'm sure that you, I and many others around this chamber have watched on with utter delight as we have watched the Matildas surge their way through to the quarter-finals. This is such an exciting moment for the country. If the Matildas win the Women's World Cup, it might be the biggest single sporting achievement that we've had as a country, certainly in women's sport. We are so proud to be cheering them on. Go, Matildas!
