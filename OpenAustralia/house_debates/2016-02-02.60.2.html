        My question is to the Prime Minister. At the last election voters saw coalition signs at polling booths that read: 'Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar.' When will the Prime Minister sign up to Labor's '

         <p>
          As the honourable member knows very well, the government is investing more money in schools than ever before. We have implemented needs based funding and we have matched and we have exceeded the former Labor government's over the four years from 2014. We have committed record levels of funding at $69½ billion over the forward estimates, and that includes a record of $5 billion in funding for students with a disability. But despite a 100 per cent increase in Commonwealth and state expenditure on schools, in real terms, between 1988 and 2012, there has been an absolute and relative decline in student performance. This demonstrates that spending more money does not necessarily get you better outcomes.
         </p>
         <p>
          School funding arrangements for 2018 and beyond will be subject to negotiations with the states and territories and the non-government education authorities. But, unlike the opposition, we will not promise the money first and, then, seek to negotiate the outcomes later. The Labor Party have no credibility at all when it comes to these big-spending proposals, as they have no way of funding them. They have no hope of funding them. Even members of the Labor Party do not believe they can deliver on their schools policy. The South Australian Labor Premier,

          , said of the Leader of the Opposition's education policy announcement, 'We haven't seen any coherent or sustainable way in which that is going to be funded.'

            . He says of the policy the opposition leader has just asked me about, 'We haven't seen any coherent or sustainable way in which that's going to be funded.' If he has not seen it, why does the Leader of the Opposition expect anybody else to take it seriously?

            We remain committed to schools funding that is fair, equitable, needs based and improves student outcomes. We are making sure it is being used where it counts: teacher quality, a better curriculum, parental engagement and in supporting principals to make local decisions about their local schools. And when we make promises we will be able to fund them. We will fund them—unlike Labor who make promises with no backing, no finance and no responsibility.
