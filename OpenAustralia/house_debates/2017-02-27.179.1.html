        I rise to defend Australia's values and condemn anyone who ever thinks that it is okay to hit a woman. I refer to comments by the prominent Muslim leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keysar_Trad" rel="nofollow">
         Keysar Trad
        </a>
        implying that violence against a woman is okay as a last resort for husbands. Trad, who is the president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federation
        </a>
        of Islamic Councils, basically said on national television, on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolt" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Bolt
        </a>
        show on Sky News, that blokes should first try flowers, chocolates and dinner dates before they resort to beating their wives. Let me make one thing very clear in this place: violence against a woman is never okay. It is entirely unacceptable in all circumstances, and I do not care if you bought flowers, chocolates, a car or a new house: you never raise a hand to a woman.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trad's comments sparked outrage across my entire electorate. The people of Wright are outraged that this man, who is meant to be a leader of the Muslim community, would be so irresponsible as to condone such behaviour. Sure, Trad made excuses for his comments afterwards, saying that it was just clumsy, but the damage had already been done. In a time when we are having to fight harder than ever to defend Australian values, Trad's comments have only served to increase fear amongst nationalities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stand with Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton and Minister for Women Michaelia Cash, who publicly condemned Trad's comments as dangerous and unacceptable I will finish by echoing Minister Dutton's words that this is Australia and anyone who comes to our country should abide by our laws. I also want our daughters to succeed, to be in a loving relationship, to get a good education and a good job, and to be the equal of any man.
