       <p>
        A couple of weeks ago I had the privilege of visiting the Shekinah centre in my electorate and meeting with the development officer, Mr Bill Fowles, the girls who participate in the program and other volunteers at the centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, in my electorate we are experiencing double the national unemployment rate and double the national suicide rate. There are many young people in our community who suffer from the pressures that unemployment and rising cost-of-living pressures put on their families, and they simply are not coping very well at mainstream schools despite the best efforts of those schools to accommodate them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately, some of the girls in my community who might be struggling to stay at school are able to attend the Shekinah centre. Here they have designed programs in order to re-engage girls with the community and with educational programs when they are at risk of falling through the cracks and being lost to the education system. The schools in my community are able to refer girls who may be marginalised or at risk of marginalisation from the education system. In fact, many girls who participate in the program return to mainstream schooling or undertake further study.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Shekinah centre has developed an alternative way of providing quality and practical educational programs to the girls in a way that removes academic pressure without compromising the integrity of the programs offered. It provides a calm and supportive environment in which the girls who attend are able to realise their potential through participating in a wide range of educational experiences and learning opportunities. Learning experiences are tailored to be hands-on and practical. Girls ride horses, cook and engage in drama and art activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I visited the centre, the girls were preparing lunch. This is an activity they undertake every Wednesday, and on the menu were satays and salad. I was impressed by the cooperative and friendly way that the girls were going about preparing the meal, setting the table and interacting with each other. It was a great environment to be in.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we sat down for lunch and went around the table introducing ourselves, the girls shared their aspirations for the future. There was not one girl who did not want to continue with her education. Most of us understand that education and training are the keys to employment. However, for some kids in my community it just is not easy to attend school, finish year 12 and go on to achieve some additional qualification that will help them to find a satisfying job. The Shekinah centre provides a safety net for some of these kids, and it is to be commended for the work it does with the girls who attend its program. Certainly, the girls I met were interested, engaged and eager to make a contribution to their community. I look forward to my next visit.
