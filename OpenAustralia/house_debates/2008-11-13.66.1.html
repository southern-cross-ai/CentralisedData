        My question is to the

         Acting Prime Minister
        </a>
        . I refer the Acting Prime Minister to media reports that Dean Mighell, the Secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Trades_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Electrical Trades Union
        </a>
        , spent $80,000 from his own workers’ redundancy fund, Protect, on an extraordinary trip to London that included business class flights, meals, drinks, valet service, internet, in-house movies, booze and other items including a phone call to a transsexual escort by the name of Suzana. Is this an appropriate use of workers’ redundancy funds? Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the member for Deakin is a former organiser for the redundancy fund? Can the Acting Prime Minister assure the House that the member for Deakin was not involved in the distribution of almost $1.4 million of the funds that were used to buy a house for Kevin Harkins, the union’s state secretary and former candidate for the Labor Party at the last election?

         Order! The first part of the question was in order but the part referring to the member for Deakin and the rest of the question were well out of order. The last part was really something that could only be introduced by way of substantive motion.

           is not helping at all. I have suggested that the first part of the question is in order. I just simply say to the member for

            North Sydney

           —as he mumbles a new precedent—that I got myself into strife when I prevented on three occasions out of about eight the Prime Minister from taking questions when they referred to the conduct of a member. That deals with the second part of the question. He knows that the third part of the question is well and truly out of the order because it is bordering on something that should be done by substantive motion.

             It wasn’t a question. Can you indicate whether it is in order for, in the guise of asking a question, members of this House to be defamed? You allowed the member for

              Order! I simply say to the Leader of the House that (1) I have ruled two aspects of the question out of order and (2) I could not have ruled them out of order until I had listened to the question. If he thinks that I am happy about that situation, I can indicate that I am not. But I cannot pre-empt what is going to happen and whether or not I think it is appropriate is not the chair’s business. I have dealt with the two aspects of the question that I believed were out of order.

                  North Sydney

                 , firstly, as I have seen in media reports, as I have been advised, ASIC is investigating the matter he refers to. If there are any allegations of improper conduct in any way then obviously that is something that ought to be properly investigated and dealt with. I will repeat what I said to this parliament yesterday in a different context: everyone should abide by the law; there are no exceptions. Everyone should abide by the law. Having said that, when everyone should abide by the law, the way the system works in this country—perhaps the member for North Sydney might prefer it were different—being a democracy, is that if there is an assertion that someone has not abided by the law, that is not tried in this parliament; that is dealt with by the appropriate investigative authorities, who should then deal with it. So everyone should abide by the law and everyone should let due process go through in relation to the allegations, and as I am advised ASIC is dealing with the matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                 More broadly, can I say this: if the member for North Sydney believes he is in possession of information that goes to proper conduct of any member of this parliament then he should immediately move the relevant substantive motion. If he does not do so, people will understand what kind of person he is.
