        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. How will the government's work bonus incentive for pensioners assist eligible veterans? How does it vary previous policy settings?

         I thank the member for Fraser for asking this very important question. I thank him for shining a light on this important issue as well as providing an opportunity to clarify some of the statements made by the member for Hume earlier today. This Albanese Labor government is committed to improving and adapting to the needs of currently serving defence personnel, veterans and families. That's why I'm proud that a key initiative from last week's Jobs and Skills Summit goes exactly to that. Aged and veteran pensioners will be able to earn an additional $4,000 over this financial year without losing any of their pension, due to the Albanese Labor government providing a one-off income credit designed to give older Australians the option to work and keep more of their money.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm very concerned that the member for Hume seems not to understand this policy, given his statement today in the media that, apparently, we 'excluded veterans'. Well, I'm prepared to give the member for Hume the benefit of the doubt. After all, we should err towards incompetence over conspiracy. To assist the member for Hume: if he turns to the very first line of the media release from the Prime Minister announcing this policy, it says 'age and veterans pensioners'. The policy announced on Friday in relation to the work bonus bank includes veterans and dependents who receive the service pension—that's the age service pension, the partner service pension, or the income support supplement paid to war widows or wholly dependent partners who are over the qualifying age.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian community has a clear expectation that veterans and their families will be well looked after. We are committed to delivering a package of practical support measures that will improve the welfare and wellbeing of veterans and families, building on the services already available. In preparation for last week's Jobs and Skills Summit, I've been meeting with businesses, veterans, recruitment agencies and ex-service organisations to develop a veterans employment white paper. One of the key outcomes of those meetings is the need to support veterans in the civilian workforce, not just as they transition immediately after service but later in life as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         The policy announced on Friday will enable veterans to do more work to earn more money before they start losing their pension, which serves two purposes. At a time of serious skills shortage, it means we can get access through this measure to more skilled labour. Importantly, it will also make it easier for veterans to go back to or remain in the workplace while receiving their pension. In addition to the increased income this provides them, it's great for their mental health as well because it means they can remain mentally engaged and give back to their communities. This is a win-win, and it is something that, despite their rhetoric now, those opposite failed to deliver in nearly a decade in office. What this means is that a veteran on the service pension now could take any job. For example, they might want to work at a local steakhouse, and they could serve the member for Hume a well done Angus.

          Order! We had this issue arise during the last week of parliament.

          ask all ministers to refer to members by their correct title. It's happened twice; it won't happen again.
