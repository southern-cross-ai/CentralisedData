       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. In 2019 the Prime Minister said that population growth driven by migration was causing strain on our big cities, and was a wake-up call to fast-track spending on major road and rail projects. But in this year's budget there is no new spending on major infrastructure projects in our capital cities. If the Prime Minister thought this was an issue in 2019, why has he done nothing about it now he is in power and there will be an extra 1.5 million people who will come to Australia over five years?

         I thank whoever suggested that they give me a question on infrastructure! I thank them very much—whoever the member of the tactics committee was who put that forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've already said that, on the issue of migration: in 2019, they were in government, and their projections, of course, when they were in government were for higher migration than we have today—higher numbers. That is the fact.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the things that have happened is—I will go through one example, really clearly, so that somehow they get this—you used to have students arrive in Australia who'd produce an income, and they'd count as part of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOM" rel="nofollow">
          NOM
         </a>
         . Students were coming for first year; other people would finish their degree and they'd go. What happened? There was a pandemic, and people didn't come, so they weren't there to go. What has happened now is the economy has opened up. Students are coming to start their degrees, but they're not leaving, because they haven't finished their degrees! I mean, it is not hard.

           On relevance, Mr Speaker: the question is not about the people who are coming. The question is: why did he say infrastructure was needed in 2019 but he now says it's not needed?

            The question also included the proposition of about 1.5 million people coming to Australia. I think that's what the Prime Minister is referring to in his answer. So I'm just going to ask him to continue.
