        What a fantastic Saturday I had in my electorate of Aston. I was out at the Wantirna Mall for a mobile office. I enjoy being out talking with my constituents. I get to meet so many excellent people, like the wonderful couple from Bayswater, Desiree and Brian, with whom I had a great chat; and a lovely man, an ex-serviceman named Tony, who approached me and said: 'Thank you, Mary. I got your letter. Thanks so much for the help with getting me running for my electric wheelchair through the

        . It is so great to finally have a representative here in Aston who's willing to help people like me.'

        This is not the first time I've heard this line from people in Aston. A vital part of this Albanese Labor government is positive change, not the negative attack lines that the opposition is offering, failing to help anyone. It may seem small on a nationwide scale, but it's supporting members of the community that need a little bit of extra assistance with getting that electric wheelchair, some guidance on 60-day dispensing or just someone to talk things through with and to find them organisations in the community who can help when times get tough. The Albanese Labor government is here and I'm here to help, because that's what being a good local member is all about.

        Back to Saturday. I was able to finish off the morning, celebrating
