        The Australian Customs Service is seeking to relocate from its existing Brisbane headquarters building shortly before the end of its current lease, which expires on 30 June 2009. The Australian Customs Service proposes to undertake a fit-out at a cost of $15.84 million inclusive of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST

        of new leased premises at the Circuit,

         Brisbane Airport
        </a>
        , Queensland. Subject to parliamentary approval, the design of the proposed fit-out and associated services will to the maximum extent possible be integrated with the base building design in order to minimise costs. All efforts will be made to further minimise costs by integrating the construction of the fit-out with the base building works should such opportunities exist. Subject to parliamentary approval, the building is planned to commence in October 2007, with completion in December 2008. The fit-out procurement process could begin during the period September to November 2008. The Australian Customs Service anticipates occupying the building from January 2009 to complete the fit-out and will occupy the building progressively from May 2009. I commend this motion to the House.

        </a>
        in my own electorate of Herbert is also included in this particular work. The strategy being proposed by the Department of Defence is to engage a strategic partner for the delivery of financing and for planning the development, construction, maintenance and operation. The government announced funding in the 2004-05 budget for Project Single Leap, phase 1 and phase 2 inclusive, of $113.2 million over four years and then an annual allocation of approximately $60 million thereafter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cost of phase 2 will be determined through a competitive tender process subject to government selection of a preferred tender and parliamentary approval. The estimated outturn cost is $1.2 billion net present value and will involve a regular service payment by Defence over 30 years for buildings, infrastructure, facilities, management services, maintenance and life cycle costs. This single-soldier accommodation has been widely accepted by members of the

         The chair can understand why the parliamentary secretary thinks that it is a good morning when his electorate has one of the sites. I am sure that the members who each have one of the 16 others do as well.

         </p>
         <p>
          The Department of Health and Ageing proposes to undertake the fit-out of new leased premises that are being constructed on a redeveloped site in the Woden Town Centre,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Capital Territory
          </a>
          . The estimated total capital cost of the fit-out is $67 million, with the fit-out construction to be integrated with the base building. The proposed new building is to be located adjacent to Scarborough Houseâ€”head officeâ€”at the northern end of the pedestrian precinct in the Woden Town Centre. Its close proximity to Scarborough House will strengthen links between all areas of the department and enhance operational efficiencies.
         </p>
         <p>
          The site will comprise the existing Sirius Building and Fisherman House sites on Furzer Street Woden. These two buildings are to be demolished and replaced by a new Sirius Building that will deliver 44,500 square metres of flexible modern office accommodation and meet the requirements of the Australian governmentâ€™s policy of energy efficiency in government operations. Additional space for a privately operated 100-place childcare facility will also be included. Subject to parliamentary approval, work is proposed to commence in October this year, with practical completion of the new building scheduled for December 2009. As a result, Health expects to occupy the building in early 2010. I commend this motion to the House.
