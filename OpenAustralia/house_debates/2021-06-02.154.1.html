        not only to the screen but to music and arts in general. Many Australians, especially those from the northern beaches, would recognise him as Evan from

        , but they may be surprised to know that he's also an accomplished musician, radio host and founder of a men's emotional health support network known as My Mens Team. Despite spending the last 25 years of his life living in the

       <p>
        Daddo's career began as a model when he was just 18 years old, and it has seen him play roles in hugely successful shows such as

        . When asked about life since returning to Australia, he said, 'Just can't beat it.' His decision to return to Australia wasn't without its challenges, but it was ultimately for the kids and it has proven to be a worthwhile decision. He still engages heavily with his online emotional health support network and, in addition to doing so, has begun a podcast aimed at helping those facing difficulties in marriage. He and his wife, Alison, managed to salvage a marriage that was struggling immensely and in learning from their experiences started recording and sharing separate bathrooms and other handy marriage tips. Despite everything going on in his personal life, Daddo managed to maintain his evening slot for Smooth

       <p>
        It is safe to say that Cameron Daddo is a successful and archetypal Australian. He has worked hard at his career and been rewarded accordingly. He has faced hardships with resilience and fortitude and come out stronger and better on the other side. He's a proud Australian. He's a proud member of the
