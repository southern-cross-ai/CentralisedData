The progression of the project will aid in Navy’s recruitment and retention.

          The main components of the project include new and refurbished living-in, office and classroom accommodation, and an upgrade of engineering services. The project will also provide modernised training and physical fitness facilities to support Navy training requirements at HMAS

         <p>
          The Department of Defence proposes the relocation of Land Engineering Agency Test Services from Defence site Maribyrnong to Monegeetta Proving Ground in Victoria. The objective of this proposal is to gain advantages from the co-location of Land Engineering Agency Test Services with its existing operations at Monegeetta, and to allow the Commonwealth to dispose of the Defence site Maribyrnong property. I have recently visited Maribyrnong and I am aware of the issues in relation to disposal of that site. This certainly will allow that to occur.

          redevelopment stage 1, Pearce, WA.

         <p>
          The Department of Defence intends to undertake stage 1 of the redevelopment of RAAF Base Pearce in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          , at an estimated out-turn cost of $142.2 million, plus GST. RAAF Base Pearce is a major military air base in Western Australia. The base primarily supports flying training and additionally supports overseas deployments and transit operations. I was recently at RAAF Base Pearce and was privileged to fly with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squadron_Leader" rel="nofollow">
           Squadron Leader
          </a>
          ‘Homer’ Simpson to look at other defence issues that were in the vicinity. While I was there, I was certainly acutely aware of the need to do this particular work.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is the first redevelopment planned for RAAF Base Pearce and seeks to address the aged, sub-standard and dysfunctional infrastructure and facilities, which do not comply with current standards. It will also enhance defence capability by enabling personnel mobility, morale, esprit de corps, training outcomes, attraction and retention.
         </p>
         <p>
          The redevelopment project will involve:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           replacement of Base-wide engineering services;
          </li>
          <li>
           a new fuel farm;
          </li>
          <li>
           a new quality control centre;
          </li>
          <li>
           a new combined mess;
          </li>
          <li>
           an upgrade to the Air Movements terminal;
          </li>
          <li>
           upgrade to the training aircraft maintenance hangar;
          </li>
          <li>
           a new noise attenuated engine run-up facility for the resident training aircraft;
          </li>
          <li>
           new living-in accommodation for cadet pilots; and
          </li>
          <li>
           demolition of redundant facilities.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Subject to parliamentary approval, further design and construction will commence in late 2007 and is anticipated to be completed by mid-2011. I commend the motion to the House.
