        I'd like to speak about a couple of fantastic schools in my electorate of Aston. I recently joined principal Liz Swan, her staff and students at Bayswater Secondary College to officially open their '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_of_Honour" rel="nofollow">
         Avenue of Honour
        </a>
        ', planted during the second half of 2022 as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Bayswater Secondary College lost a lovely old pin oak tree in a shockingly destructive Melbourne storm in late 2021. Fortunately, however, the school was able to apply for and were successful in receiving a grant of $5,000 as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The college has been able to create a garden path, planting trees known as Griffith pinks, which will grow into a tranquil place of reflection for all the students in the years to come.

        I had a lovely chat with principal Liz Swan, Chris Flynn and the VCAL students following the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and they took me through some of the great things they're doing there at Bayswater secondary. I'd like to thank them all for inviting me to officially open this lovely new Avenue of Honour and I hope very much to visit again soon.

        Another fantastic school I had an opportunity to visit was Scoresby Secondary College, where principal Gail Major and her staff hosted a primary school leadership training day with the eight local primary schools: Carrington Primary School,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoo_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Park_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Kent Park Primary School
        </a>
        , Mountain Gate Primary School, Knox Park Primary School, Knox Gardens Primary School, Scoresby Primary School and Wantirna South Primary School. The day involved senior student leaders from Scoresby Secondary College running leadership training for the school leaders from these primary schools, where they focused on developing an understanding of what it means to be a good leader, and how to collaborate to create a fundraising pitch. These bright young kids were all passionate leaders in their fields, and, as I asked some questions of them, I witnessed some excellent future leaders. I'd like to thank principal Gail Major, her staff and her students for so warmly welcoming me. Gail told me about her vast experience and passion for education in general and for the great students at the college.
       </p>

        I am looking forward to watching these schools grow and to visiting them and other schools in Aston over the coming months.
