        For the information of honourable members I present
        <i>
         R
        </i>
        <i>
         ules for media related activities in Parliament House and its precincts
        </i>
        , issued by the Presiding Officers, November 2012, which the President of the Senate and I have agreed to. These rules are the result of a year-long consultation process by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        on the Broadcast Of Parliamentary Proceedings with representatives of the federal parliamentary press gallery and members, senators and parliamentary officials. Through written submissions and roundtable discussions, each of the stakeholders has had an opportunity to make their views known. The rules will replace the guidelines for filming and photography and general media rules in Parliament House and its precincts. The rules are underpinned by four guiding principles: the openness and accessibility of parliament; the facilitation of fair and accurate reporting by media of parliamentary proceedings; respect for the privacy of senators, members, other building occupants and visitors to Parliament House; and non-interference with the operation of parliament or the ability of members, senators and other building occupants to fulfil their duties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rules will clarify for the media, members and senators and their staff where media activity is permitted with approval or not permitted in the building and its precincts. The rules have as an appendix a set of maps which clearly demark these areas. The rules also allow images and footage of chamber proceedings to be broadcast if used fairly and accurately. However, broadcast or publication of images that have been digitally manipulated is not acceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will be a condition of access for building occupants that the rules are complied with. Where breaches occur, a graduated range of sanctions may be applied. Administration of the rules will be delegated to the Serjeant-at-Arms and the Usher of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rod" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The clerks are preparing advice on proposed amendments to the resolutions relating to broadcasting of both the House and the Senate. The changes will take into account technical changes in broadcasting, including the introduction of Parlview.
       </p>
       <p>
        The President and I will seek advice from members and senators on the resolutions before they are introduced. The rules will be available on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        website. They come into effect from 5 February 2013—that is, from the first sitting week of next year. This should give us all time to become more familiar with their operations. We make it clear that all members of the Parliament—the House and the Senate—are governed by these rules. I thank the House for listening to this short presentation.
