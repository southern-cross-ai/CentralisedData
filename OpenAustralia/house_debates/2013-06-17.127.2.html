       <p>
        I rise to speak on this very important motion from the member for Dawson. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         World Federation
        </a>
        of Neurology, as this motion notes, dyslexia is 'manifested by difficulty in learning to read despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity'. This means that students with dyslexia learn differently from most students—the traditional methods of teaching, such as phonics, are not necessarily appropriate for what Dyslexia Australia calls the 'auditory learner'.
       </p>
       <p>
        First and foremost, it is important that the difficulties that arise from dyslexia are recognised by all Australians so that we can reduce the stigma for these students. Dyslexia is not, as some believe, simply flipping letters around. It can in fact present itself in four main categories. Each type of dyslexia includes its own set of challenges. Despite the unwavering dedication and hard work of their parents, these students can all too often be left behind. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Carlie Rice, whom I met recently with Glenys Throssell, who are both mothers of children with dyslexia. Carlie set up Brisbane Dyslexics as a support group for parents of dyslexic children and those with similar learning difficulties. As Glenys said, having a child with dyslexia means:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … a roller-coaster ride of doctors appointments, interventions, changing schools, in getting a diagnosis, sourcing the appropriate intervention and support … Often it is a lonely journey as a parent with a child who has a learning disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Carlie and Glenys are working very hard at getting the important message out to the community—that there is support and guidance out there for parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        In education, one of their primary concerns is with the National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        . It is simply not designed to accommodate the learning and reading styles of children with a learning difficulty or disability. For all students undergoing NAPLAN it can be an incredibly stressful time of the year, but especially for students who face additional challenges. Some parents simply keep their children at home during NAPLAN testing. As Glenys said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reason being is that we don't set up our children for failure when they have no hope of succeeding. A NAPLAN goal when testing dyslexic students should be testing their abilities,
        <i>
         not their disabilities
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        These parents know that there are improvements that can be made within the current framework of NAPLAN. As this motion notes, for example, it would be beneficial for students with dyslexia to have their NAPLAN test read to them. Given their auditory learning style, I also note that some dyslexic students with writing and spelling challenges could benefit from a scribe. These suggestions are made not to make it 'easier' for students but, rather, to ensure that NAPLAN truly fulfils the stated goal of assessing whether students are receiving the critical foundation for their learning and for their productive and rewarding participation in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must therefore recognise that the current one-size-fits-all approach to national testing does not demonstrate how well a child is progressing in a holistic sense. To that end, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Independent_School" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Independent School
        </a>
        in my electorate is demonstrating the value of providing choice and diversity to parents. I recently attended their open day and spoke with many parents and teachers about the enormous benefits that they feel the school is providing for their children. They recognise that not all students learn the same, and they are producing results. Their community wants to work alongside the mainstream education system in Queensland to provide the best early intervention programs for all their students so that they can overcome their learning difficulties. As the Glenleighden School in my electorate has demonstrated for over 30 years, early intervention can produce amazing results for students with primary language disorder, and I am sure that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIS" rel="nofollow">
         BIS
        </a>
        can do the same for their students.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank the member for Sturt who, in cooperation with SPE
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LD" rel="nofollow">
         LD
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , tabled a petition from more than 10,000 in the House on 5 June to recognise the educational difficulties of dyslexia. As the shadow minister for education he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … there is no shame in a learning disability; the only shame is if it is not recognised and treated.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all want to see that children with a disability—whether it is dyslexia, primary language disorder or others—receive high-quality early intervention. It is absolutely crucial to the students and their parents that the education system recognises and supports their needs. I commend this motion to the House.

        <p>
         Dyslexia is a neurologically based, specific learning disability that causes problems with learning to read and spell. I do not think there would be an MP in the House who has not been lobbied or meet with people who have experienced dyslexia or are the parents of someone with dyslexia. I have encountered it as a teacher; I have encountered in my work both as a teacher and as a lawyer; and I have also encountered it in my family. It is widespread. Some experts suggest that up to 16 per cent of the population have dyslexia, although that statistic is disputed. Dyslexia is the most common cause of reading, writing and spelling difficulties and, associated with that, there are often some behavioural difficulties. I commend the member for Dawson for putting this motion before the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dyslexia affects males and females almost equally, although I found as a teacher that the responses to it were more able to be seen in young boys because if they disengaged they could then be a problem student because of the problems they had with learning. It also affects people from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds equally—it does not discriminate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last month I sat down for coffee in Graceville in my electorate with a group of passionate parents and advocates for children with dyslexia. Their individual stories were heart-wrenching. I had parents coming to Moreton from all over Brisbane, happy to find a support network and some people who might be able to help on both a personal and a professional level. I was privy to their heart-warming stories of battles they have overcome and support they hope will be provided for all kids struggling with dyslexia, not just their own. I would especially like to acknowledge the work of Carlie Rice with the Brisbane Dyslexics parents support group she has established. Carlie is a constituent of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
         Her support is growing and, if people are listening who are concerned about this or see this speech sent out to them, if you wish to find out more about Carlie Rice's group, please contact my office especially if you live locally in Brisbane and want to be put in touch with Carlie and her great work. Carlie's initiative is extremely positive in that it aims to increase awareness, to share information and support, and provide support, to parents, teachers and students—and I say that again, parents, teachers and students—on the issues associated with dyslexia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor government is committed to delivering world-class education to every Australian student whether they have dyslexia or not, or whether they are on the spectrum. In our schools I say upfront that we already have great teachers working with students with a range of learning difficulties and what all of these teachers and their learning support people need is further support in these schools. The specific learning needs of students involve a wide range of abilities and learning styles, especially students with a disability and learning difficulties such as dyslexia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Plan for School Improvement could radically transform the educational outcomes for the Australian nation in recognising these needs and will work towards assisting the roles of teachers and the lives of the students who have dyslexia. It encourages the involvement of parents, families and carers by recognising the important influence they hold in a child's life. Recent announcements include $100 million in Commonwealth funding into the 2014 school year under the More Support for Students with Disabilities program. This is on top of the $200 million that the government is providing to support students with disability in both government and non-government schools, because as any educator knows, it is best to provide support early rather than wait until later when behavioural problems might be an indication that someone has got a learning disability. A disability loading will be introduced in 2015, which will provide support to students with disability based on the level of adjustment they need, and not just their simple diagnosis but unpacking the diagnosis delivered by a medical expert or an educational expert.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the reform program in place, it would be a little pre-emptive to support this motion put forward by the member for Dawson. Students with dyslexia will be supported with the implementation of the Gonski recommendations through the National Plan for School Improvement and, obviously, as the member for Dawson is a Queensland MP, he of course would be lobbying Premier Newman and education minister John-Paul Langbroek to make sure that Queensland does not miss out on the significant billions of dollars of funds that could change the lives of students with dyslexia, and every student.

         <p>
          I welcome this opportunity to speak on this important motion. It is very much something that is in the background, that a lot of people do not have a great knowledge of but which is debilitating as a disability for so many people. I am actually aware of a state member of parliament in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          who is dyslexic and, from what I hear, that person is probably not the only one in the country who is in a parliament and is also dyslexic. I can only imagine what it must be like to struggle with it. So much of what we do is about reading and communicating and it must really be difficult for a person to have to work through the bread and butter of our profession, of our calling here, and to struggle with a disability such as dyslexia. To his credit, he is a most remarkable and excellent representative of his area, and so I really do pay tribute to him.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dyslexia is something that I have heard of. Unfortunately I do not think that I have ever been approached by someone from the electorate who has said, 'I am dyslexic,' and has given me a personal perspective. But at least through this other member of parliament in the WA state parliament I have come to have a bit of an appreciation of just how difficult it can be. When you see someone that has risen and has been successful despite that disability, it really does say something about the character of people who have to cope with it and work with it.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is right that it is recognised as a disability. That is good. Sometimes we wonder what more can be done, and I think that it is important that the member for Dawson has properly highlighted this disability. We are used to hearing a lot about disabilities in this place. There are some severe disabilities, and we all certainly have contact with our constituents who have been dealt a difficult set of cards with their lives and who have managed to work with, or have to live with, that disability. Again, as I said before, dyslexia is not one of those that someone has specifically approached me to talk about, but through this state member of parliament I do appreciate what a difficult circumstance it really is for people.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is important that when we look at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
           NAPLAN
          </a>
          and at those assessments for children that we remember that, whilst there is a lot to be said for national testing, there are certainly limitations with that national testing. With dyslexia there are some supports provided. As I understand, readers are provided for those with dyslexia under NAPLAN. But at the same time there are challenges with those results, and I wonder whether they are properly appreciated and considered when school tables are attributed to the results that have come out of NAPLAN.
         </p>
         <p>
          Given the fact that dyslexia is much more common than we would normally think, it is important that we look at the opportunities to help with pre-service training for teachers so that there is a greater appreciation to help teachers identify that maybe this is the problem with young Johnny or young Sarah in the classroom—maybe it is just something that has not been detected yet. So it is a good thing for teachers, as they start teaching, to be able to appreciate and identify that this is a far too common problem and a challenge for so many children in our country and that it would really be better if they could be identified earlier on and given the proper support required. Again, I appreciate the member for Dawson bringing this important motion forward and having the opportunity to contribute tonight on a very important issue that undermines the learning of so many children.

          <p>
           I would like to congratulate the member for Dawson for bringing this motion to the House tonight. Whilst I do not agree with all aspects of it, I believe it is important to ensure that dyslexia is acknowledged as a significant learning disability and that significant resources are placed into assisting young people and children that have dyslexia. I have experienced it within my own family. I have two children who have been to university and were high achievers who could cope very well with anything that was put before them academically, but I have one child who had dyslexia. His life, the roads that he took and the opportunities that he has had in life were very different to the opportunities that my two children who did not have dyslexia had. He works in a manual area, but the problem is constantly having to convince those around you that you are able to do things, because in our society we rely so much upon being able to read the written word, and following instructions is so important.
          </p>
          <p>
           Dyslexia is estimated to affect about 10 per cent of the Australian population. In Australia the terms 'dyslexia', 'specific learning disabilities', 'learning difficulties' and '
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LD" rel="nofollow">
            LD
           </a>
           ' are used interchangeably as umbrella terms for a variety of difficulties which may or may not be dyslexia. Dyslexia is, I think, best understood if you look at it from the point of view of persistent difficulty with learning to read and spell. I know from my own personal experience that people with dyslexia develop different regimes for dealing with life so that they can get around their inability to read. They develop different ways of learning.
          </p>
          <p>
           Dyslexia has been shown to be resistant to traditional teaching methods, and there have been a lot of individualised programs that have been adopted around teaching students with dyslexia. But students need different programs. There are different causes and types of dyslexia, and it is important that teachers know how to identify a student who has dyslexia and how to develop programs and teaching methods to assist that student.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has recognised that there is a need to provide support for students with learning difficulties and disabilities, and that is why $100 million in Commonwealth funding will be going into schools in the school year 2014. It is well and truly long overdue, because our schools need to have the money and the resources to be able to give those students that have specific learning needs the assistance that they need. At the moment there is limited knowledge of the number of students that actually need this support, and that needs to be collected. We need to get nationally consistent data, and once we get this data we need to put it together in a way that will then be useful to develop and deliver those programs.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think that a number of the suggestions in the member for Dawson's motion have real merit and deserve investigation, because students who have dyslexia need extra support. I think that support while they are undergoing
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
            NAPLAN
           </a>
           , in the classroom, with their homework and in a number of different environments is very important if they are going to achieve their optimal level of learning. So I congratulate the member for Dawson for bringing it to the House.

            'Our mission is not to teach someone but to allow them to learn.' This is the mission statement of Dyslexia Australia and adequately sums up the intention of this very worthwhile, good and meritorious motion which has been moved by my friend the member for Dawson, whose advocacy in this area is to be congratulated. He recognises through this motion that dyslexia is a learning disability and does not have a cure.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to a 2010 report given to the then Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
             Bill Shorten

            , between five and 10 per cent of Australians are diagnosed with a learning disability such as dyslexia. As such, I commend this motion. I commend the member for Dawson and the motion's intention that this parliament address the critical need for teachers who are better trained to allow students with dyslexia to learn and have improved outcomes.
           </p>
           <p>
            When a person has dyslexia, words jumble. They move around. They swirl. The basic skills of reading and writing, which most people take for granted, are incredibly challenging for people with dyslexia. As more research becomes available about how students and people with dyslexia are impacted and what some strategies might be to deal with them, it is important that schools and governments adapt with that research to make this task easier. In order to achieve this, we must recognise what dyslexia is and, through the research, come to understand what profound impacts it might have on students and people who are diagnosed with it. While we will never fully appreciate the difficulty of reading and writing. Solutions and recommendations through research can make this challenge easier. As the rates of dyslexia increase and our understanding of it also grows, as a society we can come to recognise what some of the symptoms of dyslexia are, which is the intention of the motion of the member for Dawson.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to the difficulty of reading and writing, people with dyslexia often find hearing and speech challenging. They may also have difficulty with mathematics and time management. Added to this, people with dyslexia may find memory and cognition challenging and may also have behavioural difficulties. As such, it is critical that we as a society understand what the symptoms of dyslexia are so we can gain a greater insight into how best we can help people who are diagnosed with it. Obviously, schooling and education is where people with dyslexia first experience the challenges and difficulties of reading and writing. It is vital for the sake of the people this has an impact upon that teachers are better equipped, as Dyslexia Australia's mission attests, 'to allow them to learn'.
           </p>

            I refer here to the comments of the shadow minister for education. In his role as the shadow minister he firmly believes that there is no shame in having a learning disability. The only shame is if it is not recognised and treated to an individual's need. I would certainly agree with him, as I am sure all members of this House would agree with him. He is calling for the use of modified curricula and instruction in education, appropriate assistance technology and extra time for learning as students with disabilities go through school. It is crucial, he says, for children who suffer from a learning disability to receive the appropriate diagnosis, treatment and support in their school. He is currently working with the Specific Learning Difficulties Association in his state of

            to raise awareness of this by asking this parliament to formally recognise dyslexia as a disability and to provide funding to ensure the students with dyslexia receive high-quality intervention as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed. That, along with this particular motion, will really be a great enabler for young people with dyslexia. If they receive help early, it can improve their educational outcomes and, indeed, their job prospects considerably.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not to discredit the passion and dedication of our teachers to say that we need to help them learn and that schools need to play an even greater role in helping to improve outcomes of children with dyslexia. It takes a special kind of person to be a teacher. We know that these days our teachers are much more than just educators; they are counsellors, nurses, advisers and people who inspire the next generation of the nation. They give this country a great service. My daughter, Georgina, is a teacher at

            . I know of the profound impact that she and so many others have on students. I know that students with dyslexia certainly need every bit of help that they can receive.

             as 'a disorder involving a difficulty in learning to read words; also to identify numerals and symbols.' I commend Dyslexia Australia, whose motto is 'Our mission—not to teach someone, but to allow them to learn…' There is no quick fix, no cure for dyslexia. Dyslexics can correct their reading when given correct teaching methods and through adoption of resilience in a multidisciplinary approach. In fact, this federal Labor government has made child and youth health initiatives a really high priority in terms of early intervention in areas like this with preventative approaches with interdisciplinary coordination across a number of agencies. We have also seen that with our commitment of $200 million into schools in relation to disability.

             I think the member for Dawson has been somewhat good in his intention in bringing this motion. In fact, I had a close look at it and commend him for his obvious commitment to this particular issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dyslexics really do have a challenge. I have met a number in my capacity as federal member. They have problems with memory, cognition, writing and motor skills. They often have problems with hearing. Speaking patterns are often different. Behaviour problems often emerge, and there are personality issues. But I must say that, in terms of assistance for people with dyslexia, I did note what the member for Moreton talked about in terms of schooling, education and, particularly, funding. The member for Dawson in his particular motion actually makes the point that there is a connection with education, schooling and funding. I say to the member for Dawson: although I do believe he has a good heart on this issue, he would be better off pouring his efforts into speaking with his
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

             The people of Dawson would need to know that the National Plan for School Improvement would provide local schools in the electorate of Dawson with an additional $150 million over the next four years. Perhaps he should let the people, parents, friends and students at

             know that they would receive over $15 million in additional funding under the Gonski scheme that

              Campbell Newman

             and the LNP state government in Queensland refused to sign up to. What a difference that may make to students at Mackay North State High School who have dyslexia or other learning difficulties—or Bloomsbury State School in the electorate of Dawson, which would receive an additional 62 per cent in funding under the National Plan for School Improvement. What a difference the hundreds of thousands of dollars would make to students with disabilities and challenging learning difficulties in that school.
            </p>
            <p>
             The National Plan for School Improvement will change the way we fund students and schools with large numbers of people with disability. A disability loading will provide support for students with disability based on the level of adjustment. That would make a big difference in the lives of kids in my electorate of Blair and also in the electorate of Dawson. There would be more one-on-one attention, more modern equipment, better training for teachers and more understanding of dyslexia. But, regrettably, the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament and the

             stand in the way of that additional funding in electorates like Blair and Dawson.
            </p>
            <p>
             This government has done more to support children with learning disabilities than any other government previously. This government has implemented child and youth initiatives to ensure that conditions such as dyslexia are discovered early. We know that early intervention is so critical. The National Early Childhood Development Strategy, developed by

             , seeks to ensure that all children up to eight years of age have the best start in life. Our goal in this parliament must be to ensure that our children are born healthy, grow up healthy and have the support in schools to make a difference in their lives. That is why the Healthy Kids Check ensures that. I commend the government for what they do and point out to the member—

              I have listened to the different speakers thus far on the debate. It has been quite interesting, and I am glad that there has been support from both sides of the chamber to look at dyslexia and what can be done for students with dyslexia in our educational systems. It is probably disappointing to hear the parliamentary secretary pull the issue into a political argument. The fact is that the Gonski reforms as the government is currently touting them do very little in relation to this area.

              I have listened to the parliamentary secretary speak, and you might listen and actually learn something from what I am about to say. I have spoken with not only teachers, but also people who work in the field of educational support for students with dyslexia. While they say that Gonski has the right language in terms of dyslexia and support for dyslexia, they see little actually coming out of that system that is not already present in the current system. What we need is not just more money thrown at education; we need a fundamental change in the way that our educational system actually treats students who have dyslexia.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
               NAPLAN
              </a>
              is obviously an invention of this government, but the fact is that the rules for NAPLAN do not allow for significant support for students with dyslexia. Gonski will not change that system. We will still have students sitting there who have dyslexia, who have reading, writing and comprehension problems, having to undertake this momentous test with the almost certain prospect of failure on that test—because of the nature of the test—hanging over their heads. There have been repeated submissions to government inquiries and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Productivity Commission
              </a>
              inquiries by teacher organisations and by parents which actually show that the impact that that testing has on children with dyslexia is harmful and detrimental to their wellbeing and their mental health. You cannot sit a kid through that test without appropriate support and expect that they are going to pass it.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you go on the National Assessment Plan website and you type in the word 'dyslexia' in the search box, not a single result turns up. Dyslexia is almost not considered when it comes to NAPLAN. In fact, if you go and have a look through the examples that are listed in terms of what extra support is given for students with disability on the NAPLAN website, there is no example of dyslexia, despite it being such a widespread condition in the student community. NAPLAN rules do allow for scribes or support people to assist some students with disabilities, but students with dyslexia are, I would believe, in the main not covered by these sections. The scribes are there for people who have a problem with the physical act of writing. They are not there for students, in the main, who just have a learning disability such as dyslexia. A support person can be there for a student with disabilities, but, again, that support person has to be there in the classroom all the time to actually be there for a person sitting the NAPLAN test. Most students with dyslexia do not have a support person sitting in the classroom with them all day. So, again, that does not help. We have these students taking these written tests where they have to comprehend the words that are on it, where they have to actually write their responses, and these are the fundamental things that they cannot do. There needs to be a change in that.
             </p>
             <p>
              We also need a change, as I said before, with preservice training for teachers. We do not have it when every other advanced country has it, and Gonski, again, will not deliver that. The government has talked about this $200 million package that is being rolled out to schools for students with disabilities, but if you have a look at the peak bodies for dyslexia, one of the problems they are saying with that is that it does not cover students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. That money will not be going to assist students with dyslexia. It is the fundamental thing that we need assistance with in our education system so that we do not have children being left behind. The government needs to really look at the report that was done and presented to the former parliamentary secretary in this area and actually get on with adopting those recommendations.
