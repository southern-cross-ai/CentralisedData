        's inquiry into the adequacy of provisions for nursing mothers in the House of Representatives. Members may be aware that there has recently been some public interest in provisions for nursing mothers in the House. This follows a steady increase in the number of members who are balancing their role as a member with the responsibilities of caring for young children. In fact you could say that the House is experiencing a baby boom, with more than 10 members welcoming babies into their families this year. Amongst them, we have congratulated as new mothers the members for Higgins, Adelaide and Kingston. This reflects changes in the workforce and in the wider community. Many mothers are returning to work soon after having a baby, and workplaces are seeking to implement measures to support their staff to balance work and family responsibilities.

        One of the challenges for women returning to work after having a baby is continuing to breastfeed. As the numbers of breastfeeding members in the House has increased, the need for adequate provisions to support these women has become apparent. Members may be aware that members breastfeeding an infant are able to give their vote by proxy for most votes of the House. This is provided for by a resolution of the House agreed in 2008, following an earlier report by the Procedure Committee. In recent years, a number of nursing mothers have taken advantage of the opportunity to vote by proxy. As part of its inquiry, the committee will review how this provision is working in practice. The committee will also explore other ways that the House can assist those members responsible for feeding their infant to participate fully in the work of the House. For example, the committee will consider whether members should be allowed to feed their infants in the chamber, in the Federation Chamber, and during committee proceedings. While speakers have allowed babies into the chamber in the past, and other members have not always objected to their presence, it is technically against the standing orders. Indeed, there have also been occasions in this and in other houses where a member has challenged the presence of another member's child. The current rules regarding visitors in the House create uncertainty for a member wishing to take their baby into the chamber, and place the Speaker in a potentially difficult position.

        We have sought written comment from members, and some have already responded. We would be pleased to receive written submissions or less formal written comments by the end of the week. The committee has also invited members to attend a round table this Thursday at 1 pm in committee room 1R6. The round table will be a private informal discussion. All members are welcome to attend to share their views on how we can better support our colleagues during the precious early months of their children's lives. It is very important to the committee that its final report reflects the values and opinions of members of this House. The committee is also aware that the practices and procedures of the House should meet changing community expectations with regard to encouraging women to breastfeed, supporting women's participation in the workforce, and balancing work and family. We look forward to members' participation in this important inquiry.
