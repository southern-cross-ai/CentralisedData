        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Business" rel="nofollow">

         Before I answer that question, on behalf of every member of this place can I thank the member for Herbert for his service to our nation in his previous role. I understand that today is his 'Alive Day' and marks 11 years since he was badly injured by an

         in Afghanistan. Overcoming such adversity and going on to be an absolute champion for his local community in this place is a testament to his character. He stands up for his constituents, and I'm very proud to have him as a colleague. I of course thank him for his question today, and I know that he's also very passionate about apprenticeships and traineeships, and, specifically, opportunities to support people in

         , and particularly those school-leavers who will graduate, will finish school, next month.
        </p>
        <p>
         The good news is that anyone looking to enter a trade or to continue vocational education now has more support and choice than ever before, because, from the start of this health and economic crisis, we've been backing our apprentices and our trainees, to make sure that they stay in work and training through our Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage subsidy. This wage subsidy provides support for about 180,000 apprentices and trainees across 90,000 businesses. It's been essential to help keep young Australians in employment, and it's ensuring we retain the skilled workers we need to drive our economic recovery. But we know that more apprentices are needed to drive that recovery, and that's why, in the budget this year, we provided an extra $1.2 billion to support 100,000 new apprenticeship commencements. Employers will be eligible for up to half the wages for a new or recommencing apprentice or trainee until the end of September next year. This means more opportunity for jobseekers and for our young workers about to enter the workforce during this incredible period of uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we're also backing those older Australians who want to reskill, with our dedicated incentive to encourage adult apprenticeships, and there are currently more than 70,000 apprentices aged 25 to 45 and 15,000 apprentices aged over 45. In fact, when the Prime Minister was on the

         last week, at Neumann Steel in my electorate, he actually met an apprentice who had just become a grandfather. Neumann Steel is a fantastic manufacturing business. They currently employ six apprentices and envisage taking on more. We have a real plan for Australia's economic recovery.
