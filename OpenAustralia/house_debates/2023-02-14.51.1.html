        My question is to the Minister for Industry and Science. Why is it important to invest in manufacturing jobs, and are there any threats to this investment?

         Thanks to the member for Corangamite. Her state is a mighty contributor to manufacturing in this country, and there are over 260,000 men and women in Victoria who owe their livelihoods to manufacturing, so it is a big deal. The government are delivering on our commitment to establish the National Reconstruction Fund. We took it to an election, we said we wanted to do it, we are going to do it and that is what we are working on. It is a key plank in our effort to reduce this country's dependence on broken supply chains, will help in our fight against inflation and help to reduce interest rates. They are the government's chosen priority areas of the economy with a view to growing jobs, playing to our current and emerging industrial strengths, and to our strategic national priorities. Again, we said we would deliver and we are.
        </p>

         Manufacturing is absolutely critical to an economy's health because few other capabilities generate so many well-paying jobs. If you look at it, it is the seventh-largest employer. It creates nearly 900,000 jobs. Those jobs are contained within just over 90,000 manufacturing businesses. It is important to note that in some places it makes a huge contribution in regional communities. Notably in Queensland, half the jobs in manufacturing are in regional areas—very, very important. We want to be able to grow those capabilities and we want the National Reconstruction Fund to build those jobs, from research and design to production. We need coders, welders, designers, researchers, machinists and everyone in between. To make all this happen, we need expertise in key enabling capabilities.

         and Nationals say they are pro manufacturing. They love wearing the high-vis but, really, it's the cosplay coalition; they love the dress-ups. They love putting on the high-vis but are never there to back them. I remember that moment when manufacturers, who make up half of the domestic gas demand, needed support, and those opposite chose multinational profits over manufacturers. That is the record. When we are ready to invest in capabilities, some of them—for example, quantum and critical technologies—we will be dependent upon, as part of our strategic alliances. But those opposite won't support the fund that will support the development of that technology, keep companies onshore and make sure we can contribute. They are never, ever there when they are needed. They love to pretend, love to put on the high-vis but are not there to back manufacturing workers. Particularly in regional communities that depend on manufacturing, they will be scratching their heads working out why the Liberal and National parties aren't there.
