        That the House expresses its deep regret at the deaths on 17 July 2009 of Mr Nathan Verity of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>

         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        , and tenders its profound sympathy to the families and friends in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 17 July, at around 7.40 am Jakarta time, explosions ripped through the lower floors of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JW" rel="nofollow">
         JW
        </a>
        Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. It has become clear that the explosions were caused by two terrorist suicide bombers. As a result of the explosions, nine people lost their lives, three of them Australians who were active in the Jakarta business community. Mr Nathan Verity, 38, ran his own human resources business in Jakarta; Mr Garth McEvoy, 55, was a Thiess executive based in Jakarta; and Mr Craig Senger, 36, was an official with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Trade_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Trade Commission
        </a>
        . Another Australian, Mr Scott Mirilles, was injured in the bombings. All were going about their normal business, attending a regular business breakfast meeting at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JW_Marriott" rel="nofollow">
         JW Marriott
        </a>
        Hotel. We mourn the loss of each of these Australian lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that Craig Senger is the first Australian civilian official to be killed in a terrorist attack in the line of duty. Craig was a highly regarded trade commissioner at Austrade. Colleagues have spoken movingly of Craig as a man with an extraordinary spirit; in the words of Tim Harcourt at Austrade, a man who ‘was a joy to the world’; an official who worked tirelessly to build links between Australian businesses and overseas markets; and an Australian who made exceptional contributions to his local community whether he was in Canberra, Sydney, Jakarta, New Delhi, Moscow or Milan. I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade for their contributions to the memorial service for Craig that was held in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">

         Parliament House
        </a>
        two weeks ago, and I recognise the presence today in the gallery of Craig’s mother, Joan, his sister, Cate, and his niece, Holly. Their presence brings home to us the full human impact of the events of 17 July and obliges us to recommit to the task of stemming the scourge of terrorism in our own region.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we grieve for our own citizens, we also remember the devastating impact of the terrorist attack on our friends in Indonesia and those from other nations who were caught up in this violence. The Australian government extends its sympathy and condolences to the people and the government of Indonesia and the people and the governments of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the Netherlands, who also lost citizens in these bombings. These terrorist attacks are attacks on us all. We are united in our efforts to counter them. Australia stands shoulder to shoulder with the government of Indonesia in its struggle against those who perpetrate these outrages.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the days after the bombings, I spoke to President Yudhoyono to extend my personal condolences to the people of Indonesia and to offer all practical assistance in finding and bringing to justice the perpetrators of the bombings. The foreign minister, accompanied by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Adviser" rel="nofollow">
         National Security Adviser
        </a>
        and Australia’s Ambassador for Counterterrorism, travelled to Jakarta on 18 July and extended this offer in person to the Indonesian government. Indonesia has had success in recent years in bringing terrorists to justice. We have confidence that they will do so again. The government applauds the work of Indonesian authorities over the past weekend, which has resulted in the arrest of a number of alleged terrorists and the disruption of planned terrorist networks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke to President Yudhoyono again over the weekend to assure him of our continuing support and to discuss the Indonesian government’s operations of recent days. The President briefed me on the operations and told me that the government of Indonesia is unable to confirm at this stage whether
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noordin_Top" rel="nofollow">
         Noordin Top
        </a>
        , who is believed to be behind the 17 July attacks in Jakarta as well as a range of other terrorist attacks, was the person killed in the operation in central Java. The Indonesian police operations are ongoing, and it is important that Indonesian authorities are given the opportunity to announce their conclusions in their own time. It is best to await the outcome of these processes. These operations underline the valuable work being undertaken by Indonesia in countering the threat of terrorism, which the Australian government will continue to support at every level. We will further deepen our cooperation with Indonesia on counterterrorism to do all that we can to prevent similar attacks from occurring again.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the House today reflects on the pain and destruction wrought on 17 July in Jakarta against innocent civilians going about their everyday lives, we think of the families of the three Australians who perished on that day. As a nation we stand with them today, and our thoughts and our prayers go out to each of them at this time of extreme and great sadness.

        <p>
         The gruesome events in Jakarta on the morning of 17 July were a wake-up call for any of us who had dared to hope or imagine that the threat of global terrorism was on the wane. These despicable attacks on two major hotels in the heart of Indonesia’s capital claimed the lives of nine innocent people, including the lives of three of our own countrymen. These atrocities were the work of suicide bombers, almost certainly operating at the direction and behest of extremist ideologues linked to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">
          Jemaah Islamiah
         </a>
         movement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, we join with the Prime Minister in extending our heartfelt sympathies to the families of all the victims. In particular, we express our sorrow to the loved ones of businessmen Nathan Verity and Garth McEvoy, and the Austrade official, Craig Senger.
        </p>
        <p>
         By what twisted ideology could these talented, generous, well-motivated men, much loved by their family, friends and workmates, become the targets for these vicious attacks? They were Australians working in Indonesia to bolster business and people-to-people links between our countries. They were three among the many tens of thousands of Australians who took it upon themselves to travel our region and to build the bridges of commerce and culture so crucial to continuing stability and prosperity here in East Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The appalling agenda of the extremists is of course to sabotage that sense of comity and cooperation in our region, in our world. Their aim is to drive a wedge between peoples of different cultures and faiths. They must not be allowed to believe that they can succeed. In this, I am reminded of the very touching and very brave words of Mr McEvoy’s brother, Trent, and I quote:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Garth wouldn’t have wanted people to stop working in Indonesia, or for Australians to think the worst of Indonesians because of a senseless act by a small minority.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         He would have wanted everyone to continue working with the wonderful people in Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         These bombings were a vicious assault on all of us who cherish the values of free societies. These events should harden our resolve to defeat the scourge of terrorism not only in our own region but across the world. The most vital priority is to do all we can to help the people of Indonesia deal with this menace in their midst.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indonesia is a new and flourishing democracy, the world’s most populous Muslim nation and one of Australia’s most important friends and neighbours. Indonesia is also a vital example to the world of the great possibilities for fusion of the Muslim faith with the principles of an open, pluralistic and democratic society. The recent re-election of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono signified an explicit repudiation by a vastly overwhelming majority of the people of Indonesia of those who stand for religious intolerance and violent extremism. Tragically, however, these bombings indicated there remain those unwilling to accept the desire of the Indonesian people for a free, open and tolerant society.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is paramount to the mutual interests of Australia and Indonesia that we work effectively together. Nowhere has the cooperation been closer than in efforts to wage the struggle against terrorism in our region. Since the 2002 Bali bombings, in which 88 Australians were among more than 200 people to die, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
          Republic of Indonesia
         </a>
         has been as resolute as any nation in the world in the fight to defeat the global network of extremists responsible for these callous and cold-blooded acts of mass murder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia and Indonesia have jointly hosted key regional meetings on counterterrorism, including through the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. The attacks on Jakarta’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JW" rel="nofollow">
          JW
         </a>
         Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels are a reminder that the global struggle against terrorism is far from over, that much difficult work remains to be done. Indonesia, Australia and their friends and allies across the Asia-Pacific must remain vigilant and united in their determination to defeat those who would inflict these and other atrocities on innocent people.
        </p>
        <p>
         In government, the coalition established close and extensive links with democratic Indonesia to ensure the two countries worked hand-in-hand to apprehend and bring to justice those responsible for terrorist acts. The federal opposition will wholeheartedly support the Australian government in providing whatever assistance is necessary to help Indonesia identify, hunt down and deal with those responsible for these latest attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important we work closely with Indonesia in supporting and upholding interfaith dialogue, to ensure that reasonable and compassionate people of all faiths unite in the struggle to rid the world of this poisonous strain of extremism. These terrorist attacks have become a curse of the early 21st century, with the cruel and brutal destruction of life and property in so many cities across the world. We have seen an intolerable loss of innocent life, including more than 100 Australians killed by terrorist action while either travelling or working overseas. We also know that our homeland is not beyond the reach of these extremists and it illustrates why it is imperative that we as Australians do all we can to help defeat the scourge of terrorism in Indonesia, as in Afghanistan, and indeed, wherever these psychopathic murderers seek to disrupt and destroy the values of free societies and to deny so callously the rights of innocent people.
