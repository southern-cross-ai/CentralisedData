        The resilience of those hit by the devastating natural disasters earlier this year and the spirit of those who have committed themselves to the clean-up and rebuilding program demonstrates what the people and communities throughout our nation can achieve when united. So, too, on a local level in my electorate of Kooyong, the Australian spirit of volunteerism is alive and well, as displayed by those recently awarded 2011 Citizenship of the Year Awards by the council of Boroondara.

With a commitment to and passion for helping those less fortunate, Norman has developed and participated in an extensive range of community programs and projects, including SecondBite, which provides food for those who would otherwise be without, and numerous Camcare programs, whose new facility, located on St Johns Ave, Camberwell, I visited on its official opening on 10 November last year.

        Daniel Cronin is a terrific young Australian. Daniel is the co-founder and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of the not-for-profit organisation Step Back Think, which aims to reduce alcohol fuelled violence among adolescents and young adults. Daniel witnessed firsthand the trauma and suffering inflicted through alcohol fuelled violence when his close friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McCready" rel="nofollow">
         James McCready
        </a>
        -Bryan was the victim of a brutal and violent alcohol fuelled attack in 2006. James was knocked to the ground with a single punch. With James’s head making contact with the pavement, the resulting medical diagnosis was significant brain damage from which James will never fully recover. Daniel’s passionate advocacy in working to reduce alcohol fuelled violence has seen him take part in education and peer awareness campaigns discussing the implications of youth participation in violent behaviour induced by the consumption of alcohol. I have got to know Daniel well over the last few years and have the utmost admiration for his commitment to helping his fellow citizens.

        Robert Pettit is a passionate coach and committee member at Ashburton United Soccer Club. While the soccer club’s home ground sits just outside my electorate, many members of the Kooyong community play at and support Robert’s club. Although Robert has been a long-term soccer enthusiast, he first became involved with the club when his children joined.

        I congratulate all three participants on being recognised for their significant contributions to our Boroondara community. I also acknowledge the support of the Boroondara council and the mayor, Nicholas Tragas, as well as our local paper, the
