        As we approach

         International Women's Day
        </a>
        , I rise to shed light on the pivotal steps taken by the Albanese Labor government in advancing women's economic empowerment. Since forming government in 2022, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

        has embedded women's economic equality as a core ideal for our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we have seen the publication of individual companies' gender pay gaps by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. This signals a momentous shift in Australia's approach to measuring gender parity in the workforce. For too long gender pay gaps have lurked in the shadows. They have perpetuated systemic injustice that upset the full participation and advancement of women. But with a stroke of the legislative pen in March 2023 by the Minister for Women,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
         Katy Gallagher
        </a>
        , we are seeing a new era of transparency—one that holds employers accountable for the conditions within their workplaces. The public naming and shaming of companies with significant gender pay gaps will serve as a powerful catalyst for change and compel them to confront gender pay inequalities head on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the stewardship of the Labor government, the gender pay gap has fallen to its lowest point in a decade, with the latest figures revealing a 14.8 per cent gap in the private sector and a notably reduced 10.4 per cent gap in the public sector. We should recognise this as tangible progress. However, despite these remarkable strides in recent years, there is still so much work to be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the first time in our nation's history under the Albanese government, we boast a majority of the federal caucus being women, with a record number of women occupying seats in cabinet. This milestone isn't just a symbol; it is transformative. It underscores our firm belief in the power of diversity and the proven impact of having women at the decision-making table. Let me be clear: it makes a big difference. Having women in positions of leadership isn't just about representation; it's about driving solid change. It's about recognising the unique perspectives and experiences that women bring to the parliament and utilising them to shape policies that uplift and empower all members of our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the course of Labor's first two budgets, we have also made significant investments aimed at supporting women in every aspect of our lives. Whether it's through increased funding for child care, extended paid parental leave provisions, bolstering women's safety initiatives or advocating for fairer wages, we have left no stone unturned in our quest to level the playing field for women across this great nation. By prioritising gender-sensitive policies, we are not only advancing the economic interests of women but also fostering a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        To take an example: Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts policy will put more money back into the pockets of 90 per cent of taxpaying women. Further, we are forging ahead with the development of a comprehensive national strategy to achieve gender equality. This strategy will serve as a road map—a blueprint for building a future where every woman has the opportunity to thrive and succeed unrestricted by the constraints of gender bias and discrimination.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, let me leave you with some sobering statistics. While Australia has made strides in recent years, we still have much ground to cover, with a national gender pay gap of 13 per cent. Women continue to earn $252.30 less per week than their male counterparts. These disparities are not just numbers; they represent the lived experiences of millions of women. It is truly our duty to ensure that they are afforded the same opportunities, rights and dignity as their male counterparts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have met a lot of great women here and seeing the diversity in parliament gives me the opportunity to go out to my community and point to our example. I look forward to attending many events in my electorate, especially all the breakfasts and lunches! I'm looking forward to all that. To all the women members of parliament, all the women working in this building, all the women who live in my community of Holt, all Victorian women and women across this great nation I say happy International Women's Day!
