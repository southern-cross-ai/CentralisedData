        It was a very special day on 6 February 2021 for Yeronga State School. It was the day Yeronga celebrated its 150th anniversary with a foundation day assembly. Boggo
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        was opened on 6 February 1861 with 63 foundation pupils; 15 years later, in 1886, it was renamed Yeronga State School. Since then more than 25,000 children and their families have, in some way, been touched by Yeronga State School. I include my own family in that group as my youngest son, Leo, graduated from there last year. In 1893 the school offered relief to families who had lost their homes in the great Brisbane flood, an act repeated in 2011 when, once again, the school became a refuge for local families affected by floodwaters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation assembly, led by the current school leaders and the new principal, Mrs Eunice Webb, included an array of dignitaries and speakers who reflected on the 150 years of the school. The guest speaker, sculptor Rhyl Hinwood AM, attended the school from 1945 to 1954. She is a renowned artist who created the magnificent ceramic Australian coat of arms perched high above us in this chamberâ€”up there. After the assembly, Len, the senior alumnus, guided the junior, Stella, as they cut the ribbon at the historic school gates to cheers and claps. I look forward to attending more Yeronga State School 150th anniversary celebrations. Yeronga is a mighty school devoted to caring and to high academic results.
