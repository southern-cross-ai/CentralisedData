       <p>
        Last week, our nation was rocked to the core by the tragic and senseless deaths of Hannah Clarke and her three children: Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey. Ms Clarke was killed in a disturbing set of circumstances which certainly highlight the need for continuing action in respect of the issue of domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there certainly has been a profound transformation in community awareness and understanding about this very complex issue, it's been there for a long time. But the unspeakable brutality that we witnessed last week makes it clear that domestic violence continues to remain a significant and pressing issue in our community. On average, one woman is killed every week by a partner or former partner. This isn't a statistic where we can afford to put our heads in the sand and say it's a matter for the authorities. This is a matter for all of us, and it must be addressed holistically.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we remember Ms Clarke, her children, the countless other women who have lost their lives through domestic violence and their grieving families. If someone you know needs help, I urge them to speak to 1800RESPECT, Lifeline or the Men's Referral Service. We can and must do everything possible to break the scourge of this violence.
