        This week I had the pleasure of attending the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Sheds Group function, where we took the opportunity to meet with delegates from all around Australia who had come to raise the profile of the Men's Sheds organisation in this country and share some of the wonderful stories not only of achievements in their own communities but of how they are helping a sector of the market. The Parliamentary Friends of Men's Sheds Group is co-hosted by

        Representatives in the room were from each of the states around Australia. Each give their time voluntarily to an organisation. They were accompanied by the executive assistant manager, Melissa White, who does a great job in coordinating each of the requests of Men's Sheds from around Australia. Some of the activities that Men's Sheds, such a worthy organisation, contribute to in the community are restoring furniture, where they turn up legs of chairs that are donated to them and then give them to organisations. They will fix pushbikes for children from lower socioeconomic homes or that are found at the dump. I am aware of one Men's Sheds organisation that is taking the wheels off pushbikes, making up makeshift wheelchairs and exporting them to Fiji and those countries where wheelchairs are scarce. They fix lawnmowers for older people and for those who do not have the capacity to get that done by other means.

        Often in a Men's Sheds room you will a see coffee table, which symbolises the ethos of Men's Sheds, which is sharing communication and sharing those problems you may not have anyone else to share them with. I hear from my electorate the wives are extremely happy with Men's Sheds because it gets the old boy out of the house for a couple of hours in the day and takes stress off relationships. The wives are very happy that the Men's Sheds organisation exists. The men also learn about good health. I know of some in my area that have learned additional computer skills. That may sound blasé, but one of the great things about elderly gentlemen learning how to use a computer and, in particular, how to use email is that it allows them to re-engage via Facebook and email with family, siblings or children they may have lost contact with over the years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, there are about 600 Men's Sheds in Australia. The organisation is forecasting that will grow to about 1,200 over the next 12 months to two years. In my area of Wright, I am very proud to say that I have no fewer than four Men's Sheds. There is one at Gatton, which did a magnificent job during the floods when many pumps, tractors and pieces of mechanical equipment were inundated with water. The Men's Shed have taken on the role of receiving that equipment, going through it, changing the filters and redoing the motors at their own expense, and then donating them back. They are donating their time and then giving the equipment back so that that part of the horticultural sector is able to get back on its feet.

        A couple of weeks ago Boonah Men's Shed had a sausage sizzle outside the Mitre 10, raising the profile of their organisation and trying to attract new numbers. I was lucky enough to be in a situation to help them out financially so that they were able to attend the national conference. Beaudesert Men's Shed is also very active in the community. They are currently making toys for Christmas gifts. There is also a Men's Shed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tamborine" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Tamborine
        </a>
        , up on the hill. Each of my Men's Sheds is at a vastly different stage of development. At the moment the one at Mount Tamborine, which I had the opportunity to speak to on the phone a couple of times, has limited resources—only a shipping container. As I alluded to, it is at a totally different stage of its development. Age is no barrier to entering the Men's Shed. I encourage each of the members in this House to get behind their Men's Sheds in their areas and develop them, as they are a worthwhile cause.
