        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister representing the Special Minister for State. Why is it important that registered political parties run stable and coherent candidate selection processes?

           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing orders are quite clear that a minister can be asked questions about matters within their ministerial responsibilities. Candidate selection could not possibly be within the responsibilities of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. I respectfully ask you to rule the question out of order.

              The Leader of the House will resume his seat. One of the interesting things about the Australian parliament is that it actually has two houses! Sometimes ministers with direct responsibility for matters are in the Senate, but there are ministers representing those ministers in this place, and I am pretty sure of my recollection that it is the Minister for Finance and Deregulation for the matters contained in the question.

              <p>
               Mr Speaker, on the point of order: it is certainly true that in the past the minister for finance or the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
                Special Minister of State
               </a>
               has been asked questions about donations to political parties within their responsibilities. But it is without precedent for the minister for finance or the Special Minister of State to be asked to comment about candidate selection, whether for their own party or for another political party, and I respectfully put it to you that this would be a bridge too far and that therefore you rule the question out of order.

                     Well, you can go â€˜no, no, noâ€™ all you like. The member for Moreton went on to finalise the question, but there was so much noise I would have been happy for him to start again. I think people ought to get back to what now is the more important aspect of the complaints that are being made, because I think that it is acknowledged that the minister for finance can answer questions on behalf of the

                          Mr Speaker, I hear what you have said so far on this matter. I would point out to you that in standing order 98(c) it says:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible or officially connected:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          (i) public affairs;

                          (ii) administration; or
                         </p>

                          (iii) proceedings pending in the House.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I put it to you that, even if the Minister for Finance and Deregulation was being asked this question in place of the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">

                          , whom he represents in the House of Representatives, the Special Minister of State could not be asked this question because it is a question about candidate selection. The Special Minister of State would not be entitled to answer this question, either in this House or in the Senate. Therefore, I put it to you, Mr Speaker, how can it be relevant for the minister for finance to be asked a question that the minister he represents in this chamber could not be asked?

Recently in an interview on 4BC, within the one interview he managed to claim that both sides of politics supported the invasion of Iraq, which of course is not true. He then said that he did not know which year this invasion occurred. He then said that the Liberal National Party did not have a policy on child support. When asked for the partyâ€™s policy on asylum seekers he said, â€˜Well as we have said, we will turn back the boats, we will â€¦ ah â€¦ go through the process of turning them into legitimate â€¦ ah â€¦ arrivals and we will begin to look at that â€¦ how we go about doing that.â€™

                                               So they clearly have a state of extreme confusion. And the problem for Mr Wyatt Roy is that he has been effusively endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. The reason that is a problem is because the member for Ryan was previously effusively endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition, and Hajnal Ban was also effusively endorsed by the Leader of the Oppositionâ€”shortly before being disendorsed. The Leader of the National Party has even described Mr Roy as a future prime minister. Those of us who know the Leader of the National Party can probably understand that because most of the people he encounters probably look like future prime ministers to him.

                                               There is a very serious aspect to this. The Australian people deserve better than this rabble. They deserve better than the chaos that is occurring in the Liberal National Party in Queensland because people are entitled to understand who they are being asked to vote for, to become acquainted with them, to hear what they have got to say and to know what they are on about. They are being denied that opportunity in Queensland. The Liberal National Party in Queensland is demonstrating yet again the merit of
