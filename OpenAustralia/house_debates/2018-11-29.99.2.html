        As the end of the year draws near, it's time for many of the schools across my electorate to celebrate and reflect on their achievements this year. It has been both a privilege and a pleasure to spend time across the diverse spectrum of Werriwa schools over the past few weeks. Today, I would like to speak briefly about some of the things going on in these schools.

        On Saturday night, 10 November, I attended Unity Grammar's Reach For The Stars Gala 10th year anniversary celebration. It was a very special night. The school showcased the incredible talents of its diverse students and staff, not only academically but also in community and charitable works. Unity Grammar is a shining example of a vibrant multicultural community, educating Australia's leaders of tomorrow. They have achieved so much in the past 10 years. I can't wait to see how the community grows and flourishes in the 10 years ahead.

        Two weeks ago, I attended the girls high school graduation at Amity College. Amity College is another stand-out example of a dynamic, supportive multicultural community in my electorate. I am always blown away by Amity's results in the

        </a>
        and the incredible things its students go forth to achieve. Amity College has a long, proud history in my electorate. It was first built by Turkish families with a vision of quality education. It has grown into a thriving, multicampus community. It was a privilege to help send off their latest graduating cohort. I know that they will all make the Amity community and the rest of us proud.

        A few weeks ago, I had the exciting task of presenting Thomas Hassall Anglican College with a parliamentary chamber flag. This flag flew outside the House of Representatives on 22 August. This was the day that the school opened their new sports centre. The Rawdon Middleton

        Sports Complex is a state-of-the-art facility, and I hope it will be enjoyed by students and community members for generations to come.

        To mark
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        on 11 November, I joined with the principal, staff and students of Cecil Hills High School to dedicate their new, beautiful remembrance garden. One of their retired teachers has done a lot of planting and other things in the garden. The garden focuses on a local soldier, Lawrence Hanna, who lived in Liverpool, whom the students had looked into and found out about. It was especially momentous to be at the service with Mr Hanna's daughters and granddaughters. Lest we forget.

        It is always a pleasure and an honour to be asked to events in my electorate. I want to celebrate the students and teachers of all the schools in my electorate, who do such a great job every day with our upcoming children.
