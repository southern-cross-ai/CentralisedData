        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Jones
        </a>
        , of Merriwa, who wrote to the Prime Minister on 10 May. In his letter he writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am particularly concerned with the tax on super profits for the mining industry … it is not just money at stake, what about employment, housing, and small business viability, they are all at risk … it is bad policy … and one which I cannot support … I am not involved in any way to the mining industry. I am just a simple man who is trying to keep my head above water and looking forward to a happy retirement in 10 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the Prime Minister assure Mr Jones and the 778,000 self-funded retirees in Australia that the government has done an analysis on how the new mining tax will affect them? If so, will the government release it?

         I thank the member for Pearce for her question because it goes to superannuation earnings and it goes to the overall performance of an economy upon which those earnings are based. The letter that she referred to from her constituent went to a number of points, one of which was the impact on employment, another was the impact on small business and the third was in relation to superannuation. On the question of employment, to which she referred in her question, can I say to the member for Pearce that the impact on

In response to the point of order raised by the member for Sturt, I refer him to the matters quoted by the member for Pearce from the letter of 10 May. They form part of the question. At the point at which the member for Sturt interrupted the Prime Minister for his point of order, the Prime Minister was responding to those matters that were quoted from the letter.

             Firstly, on the question of the impact on employment, if the honourable member reads the documents released by the Treasury, she will see that the analysis contained within them projects an increase in employment as a result of the implementation of the government’s tax measures. The reason for that is that we are boosting the overall cost competitiveness of Australian business at large, and the employment consequences of that across the entire economy are significant, particularly when you look at the concentrations of employment which lie both within and beyond the mining sector. Secondly, she referred to the small business sector. I would have thought that, in terms of the impact of the government’s tax package, the cut to the company rate—30 per cent of small businesses are incorporated—and the impact—

              Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. The question was very specific. Does the $9 billion come from profit or does it come from—

               will resume his seat. I hope the member for North Sydney has got the supplement to the question off his chest and feels happy, but it is beyond the standing orders. On relevance, under any version of relevance that is being used: the question quoted a letter and in that letter there was an expression ‘What about certain matters?’—employment and small business were included—therefore the Prime Minister is responding to the question and he is in order. But I simply say to the member for North Sydney that the device of coming to the dispatch box on a point of order and using it to add to the question is not in order.

               <p>
                Firstly, the overall impact of the government’s tax reform plan is to increase employment across the Australian economy. Secondly, can I say to the honourable member on the point that she raised from her constituent on the matter of small business, small businesses will benefit first of all—the 30 per cent of them which are incorporated—from the overall two per cent reduction in the company rate and, secondly and most significantly, for all 2.4 million Australian businesses, the impact which arises from the $5,000 each year tax write-off which is possible against the assets which they invest in.
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
                 Can I
                </a>
                say therefore to the honourable member, on the question of the impact on small business, there are two specific measures contained in the government’s overall tax package which assist small business.
               </p>
               <p>
                The honourable member then goes on to ask about superannuation earnings, in particular for self-funded retirees. All superannuants have an interest in the long-term performance of Australian equities markets and in the other investments which superannuation funds make. Can I draw the honourable member’s attention to what the Treasury’s analysis says about the future performance of the Australian mining sector as a consequence of the broadening of the base of the mining sector which is achieved by these reforms: a 4.5 per cent increase in mining activity and an increase in employment in the mining sector. Over time, you can see that therefore this is a sound set of reforms for the mining industry as it looks to the future.
               </p>
               <p>
                Therefore, whether it is the economy at large or the mining sector in particular, the government stands by these reforms. They are good for the economy, they are good for growth, they are good for employment, they are good for business and therefore they are good for the long-term investments and therefore returns to Australian superannuants. I conclude by saying this for the millions upon millions of Australian workers who stand to benefit from having their superannuation guarantee level increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent: we stand on the side of better super for working families; the Leader of the Opposition stands on the side of ripping that super away from working families.

                  I thank the honourable member for Forde for his question, as I know he is concerned about his local small business community and his community in South-East Queensland. I note in passing to the member for Forde that the secondary schools in his electorate stand to be directly punished as a result of the opposition’s policy to cut funding to trades training centres. In fact, there are a number of secondary schools in his electorate which stand to be punished as a result of that.

                     <p>
                      The strength of the Australian economy depends on three core factors. One is keeping this economy out of recession, and that is what we have done together as a nation in response to the global financial crisis. The second is bringing the budget back to surplus, back in black, three years early, three years ahead of time, and in just three years time, and halving the net peak debt of Australia. The third is a program of economic reform. That is where tax reform comes into play.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This government is committed to the importance of tax reform, because this package of measures boosts Australia’s global competitiveness because of the reduction to the company tax rate and the assistance to small business. Secondly, it boosts Australia’s level of overall national savings some $85 billion over the decade ahead. It boosts the individual retirement incomes of working Australians to the tune of some $108,000 in the case of an average 30-year-old worker and it also boosts our investment in infrastructure—rail, road and ports.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      On the question of a profits based tax regime, can I say to those opposite and the parliament at large that this government is committed to the principle of bringing in resources tax reform because we believe this principle is right. Firstly, it is right as we move towards a system of resource taxation which taxes profits, not production. The existing system of state royalties is inefficient. Royalties tax production unfairly disadvantage miners who have high costs upfront, in particular high extraction costs. Furthermore, the proposed
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Super_Profits_Tax" rel="nofollow">
                       Resource Super Profits Tax
                      </a>
                      , as a tax on profits, shares the risk between companies and the government.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Let me go to what that means in particular. The government effectively contributes 40 per cent of the cost of the investment through deferred tax credits—that means to offset the initial investments by a company. Furthermore, as that company goes through its initial years of operation this deferred tax credit continues to be drawn upon. If for whatever reason the venture fails, then the company in question can transfer that to a further project or have the remaining amount refunded by the government. Furthermore, the government then takes 40 per cent of super normal profits to the extent that those super normal profits exist. Finally, and most critically, the government then fully refunds the existing state production based royalties. This is the core architecture of a profits based regime. That is what the government is seeking to bring in.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What is the overall effect on the economy? Why is this a worthwhile reform? Firstly, it means less profitable mining companies will actually pay less tax. For example, Treasury modelling indicates that, for a typical project, a company earning less than 10 per cent returns will pay less tax. Secondly, it is a flexible system because, as commodity prices change over time, a company will pay more during boom times and less as commodity prices moderate over time. The crude blunt instrument of a volume based tax does not do that. Thirdly, what we have also is a system which enables companies to rely upon a tax system which replaces the patchwork quilt of an inefficient existing state based royalties regime. That also enables companies not to be subjected to individual decisions by state governments to jack up royalties regimes in a manner not consistent with the profitability returns of the companies in question. That is a further reason why this is a good reform for the economy. Finally, this system would introduce minimal distortions to production decisions by companies developing their resource simply because it is a tax on profits and not a tax on production. It is for these reasons that, under an
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPT" rel="nofollow">
                       RSPT
                      </a>
                      scheme, mining investment is projected in the Treasury’s modelling to rise by 4.5 per cent, jobs within the sector by seven per cent and mining production by 5.5 per cent, because this is an efficient tax based on profit, not on volume.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Others who are engaging in this debate have seen the merit of this. I referred yesterday to comments by the former Treasurer,
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
                       Peter Costello
                      </a>
                      . I referred to comments by the former Leader of the National Party,
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fischer" rel="nofollow">
                       Tim Fischer
                      </a>
                      . Even the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerals_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                       Minerals Council of Australia
                      </a>
                      has come out today and accepted the logic of a profits based system. It said:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      We in fact put on the table through the course of the Henry review there was a view that let’s move from the inefficient and complex set of royalties that exist across states to a profits based system where the risk and reward is shared between the state who owns the minerals and the companies that develop them.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So says the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCA" rel="nofollow">
                       MCA
                      </a>
                      . On the merits of a profits based tax system, these individuals are not alone. Enter the member for Tangney. The member for Tangney was asked this very basic question this morning—I notice he is not seeking to engage our attention here: ‘But economically it is more sensible to have a profits tax rather than a production tax. I mean that’s just economics 101, isn’t it?’ The member for Tangney’s immortal reply was:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      Well, the point is … ah. I won’t go into arguing the specific merits of that … ah I mean, yeah, there is potential that taxing profits is better than simply taxing volume.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In other words we have from the great state of
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                       Western Australia
                      </a>
                      over there the member for Tangney endorsing the fundamental tax principle which underpins this government’s proposed tax reform. But there is more. Enter the shadow minister for finance. This was pretty interesting. What we have from the shadow minister for finance is a statement which says:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      This debate has never been about the design of the tax … The debate is all about the size of the tax grab.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In other words, from the shadow finance minister and the member for Tangney we have a fundamental endorsement of the principle of a profits based tax system.

                      </a>
                      say to those opposite that this actually raises a deep question for the Leader of the Opposition. He has had three different tax policies in three days: on Monday it was ‘There was just enough tax’, on Tuesday ‘Not enough’ and on Wednesday his policy was that there was far too much. Does the opposition leader support of shadow minister for finance in embracing a profits based tax regime? We are all ears.

                            I will get around to the side titles. Whilst I know that the member for Berowra is taking the advice of somebody that he respected very much in parliamentary life to try to get my notice, and I usually try to ignore him, his interjection relates to a standing order that does not exist. Was the Prime Minister quoting from a document relating to public affairs?

                                My question is also to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government’s decision not to adopt the Henry review recommendation to exempt dozens of quarry and mining products extracted by small and family business operations from its great big new tax on mining. Does the Prime Minister agree with the respected financial journalist

                                and his assessment that the Rudd government’s great big new tax on mining will ‘hit quarries and other basic businesses that mine and make a profit’ and that:

                                 I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The government’s tax reform plan is clear. There is a consultation process underway. It will deal with detail, it will deal with implementation and it will deal with transition arrangements. We have said this from the beginning. We continue to engage in that consultation with all firms, and that process of consultation is working effectively, including in relation to the matters just raised by the member for Dunkley.

                                  My question is to the Treasurer. What have some of Australia’s most respected economists had to say in the last 24 hours about the importance of the resources super profits tax to the future success of our economy?

                                   I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The answer is that 20 of our most respected economists have had some very sensible things to say overnight about a resources super profits tax, and I will talk about that in a moment. But there has also been some more commentary today, particularly from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said today on

There has been a vigorous debate about modernising our tax system when it comes to the mining industry. There is a vigorous debate about the tax, about its rate and about its design. But I think there is now one thing that almost everybody in the debate—except the Leader of the Opposition,

But on this occasion, as the person that has been mentioned is not covered by the standing orders, there is no action that I can contemplate and will take. The reason for me inviting the Treasurer to pause was that the level of interjection was not, by any standards, ‘robust’ or in any way respectful. I think that members should really just think about the way in which we engage with each other in this place. I am happy to have the contest of ideas; I am not happy to have the contest of personalities. The Treasurer.

                                                              I was talking about the views of 20 respected economists and I wanted to go through some of those views. This is a very important debate for Australia—for how we reform our economy as we go forward, for how we grow our economy, for how we invest in our businesses, for how we invest in infrastructure and for how we grow our national savings. Those 20 respected economists treat this issue very seriously, and it is worth while debating it in this House. I want to quote from them. This is what they say:
                                                             </p>

                                                              … it is desirable to levy a charge for access to publicly-owned mineral resources, in addition to normal corporate income tax.
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p>
                                                              …              …              …
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p class="italic">
                                                              … this is an appropriate time for them to adjust to a more efficient and equitable system of sharing the value of those rights.
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p>
                                                              Yesterday we were talking about the fact that these minerals were non-renewable, that they could only be mined once. What we have to do is extract the maximum value for the Australian people as we go forward—to reform our economy, to invest in our economy and to ensure our prosperity as we go forward. This is a very serious issue and it should be treated seriously by those opposite. The economists go on to say:
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p class="italic">
                                                              There is no reason to expect a net contraction in mining over the longer term as a result of replacing royalties with the proposed resource rent tax.
                                                             </p>

                                                              This is because a tax on economic rent of non-renewable resources is a more efficient revenue than taxing mining production.
                                                             </p>

                                                              These are very serious points, but they do not seem in any way to be accepted by those opposite.

                                                              Mr Quiggin went on today to make this observation, which was very pertinent to some of the points that were made in earlier questions. He said:
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p class="italic">
                                                              … there’s no reason at all to think that the tax is going to affect world prices of these minerals and therefore that that’s going to feed, in any way, into Australian consumer prices.
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p class="italic">
                                                              On the other hand, there’s potentially some benefit for consumers in the offsetting reductions in the general rates of company tax.
                                                             </p>

                                                              So it certainly is depressing to see this kind of scare tactic put up. It really is just to shorten the debate.
                                                             </p>

                                                              Those opposite do not want to acknowledge that we are also moving to a corporate rate tax cut. It is very embarrassing for the Liberal Party to be in this House opposing a corporate rate tax cut whilst at the same time wanting to impose their own. It is very embarrassing for the party that is supposed to be representing business in this House to be opposing sensible reforms to the taxation system for corporates and, most particularly, for small business. But it is more embarrassing for them because they are out there on their own—with Mr Palmer—opposing the fact that we need this profits based tax in the first place.

                                                              There have been some spectacular interventions in this debate, and probably none more so than the one this morning from the Leader of the Opposition where he said that they should be paying less tax. That is a view that is not shared by many. It is not even shared by the

                                                              . Mitch Hooke said this morning, ‘The concept of a profits based tax is absolutely a tick.’ So even the Minerals Council of Australia is in the cart for a profits based tax, but of course the member for Groom is not and the Leader of the Opposition is not. It just shows you how short-sighted they are, how negatively political they are and how they are not interested in our national interest. They are simply stuck in the past and incapable of coming to grips with the big economic challenges facing this nation. We on this side of the House will do everything we can to ensure that Australians get a fair share of their non-renewable resources so we can invest in jobs, growth and prosperity for Australia.

                                                                I thank the member for Herbert for his question. On the consultations at present between companies and the Treasury panel, they cover businesses from right across the mining spectrum. I would encourage the honourable member to ensure that the company in question is fully engaged with the consultation panel. Secondly, the member for Herbert asked a question about the impact on cost of living of the government’s overall tax reform proposal. I would draw his attention again to what is contained in the Treasury’s analysis of the overall impact on consumers and, furthermore, to the analysis just referred to by the Treasurer in his response and particularly to the comments today by Professor Quiggin on the question of the overall impact on prices.
                                                               </p>

                                                                When it comes to prices, as the honourable member would be aware, the changes to the company tax rate and for small businesses also will have an impact on how profitable those businesses are overall.
                                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

                                                                say also that the profitability of those firms, particularly if they have a turnover in excess of $5 million, is directly affected negatively by the Leader of the Opposition’s great big new tax on every business in the country turning over more than $5 million. The flow-through impact on cost of living for bread, milk and other basic grocery items right across the food chain is significant, as many people from the corporate sector very plainly pointed out when the Leader of the Opposition announced that policy only a couple of months ago—a policy he continues to support. I would also encourage the member for Herbert to encourage his constituent to directly engage with the Treasury panel and to ensure that the concerns raised by them are effectively addressed by the Treasury.

Yet again, the Leader of the Opposition has shown how out of touch he is with the Australian community when he said on radio: ‘Any fair-minded analysis would suggest that mining companies were paying more than their fair share of tax.’
                                                                    </p>

This is about supporting households and businesses and, very importantly, it is also about supporting small and medium sized businesses in Australia, which are so vital to the tourism sector. I was therefore astounded to hear the comments of Senator Barnaby Joyce on
                                                                     <i>

I remind members that he is not just a Queensland senator; he is also the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure. This is what he said about the importance of the tourism sector in Australia, of which the restaurant sector is a vital component: ‘The mining sector is slightly more important to us than the restaurant sector.’ As the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism, I simply say that they are all important sections of the Australian community. Perhaps the member for Moncrieff ought to give his close mate, Senator Barnaby Joyce, a lecture on the importance of the tourism sector to the Australian community, especially the importance of the small business sector to that industry. For example, the tourism sector is worth $41 billion per year. It accounts for 3.6 per cent of Australia’s
                                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

I also bring to the attention of the House what the Restaurant and Catering Australia has said on a number of occasions. It credits the government’s decisive action with injecting at least $80 million into restaurant and catering businesses during the global financial crisis and with assisting them in getting through that very difficult challenge. But, yet again, we find the opposition dismissing the importance of the small and medium sized business sector of the Australian community. Having sought to deny them assistance during the global financial crisis, they are again seeking to deny them assistance out of a broader tax reform package. By way of example, the opposition is seeking to deny the 93 per cent of tourism businesses that are small to medium sized businesses the cash flow benefits of an instant write-off of assets worth up to $5,000. For tourism businesses that is important. It represents the potential immediate write-off of such assets as
                                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

                                                                    </p>

                                                                     The opposition is also seeking to deny an annual saving of $94 million to the accommodation and food services sector from the potential reduction in the company tax rate from 30 to 28 per cent. The opposition is therefore effectively seeking to deny one or both of those benefits to 93 per cent of tourism businesses throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Many of them are in regional Australia. You would think that the shadow minister for regional development would have a better understanding of the importance of tourism, a better understanding of the importance of the restaurant industry and a better understanding of the importance of the small business sector to the Australian community. But, then again, I should not be amazed because I think he, like the Leader of the Opposition, has decided that this is not about tax reform in Australia. He has assessed that, from their point of view, there are bigger donations to come from the mining sector than from the small and medium sized business sector of the Australian community.
                                                                    </p>

Yes, there is a bit of rough and tumble but we are committed to winning through because this is about broad tax reform. This is not only about a fair return to the Australian community for the development of its resources; it is also about a helping hand, and appropriately so, to small business operators—and many of them are in the tourism sector that was so dismally dismissed by the shadow minister for regional development last night.
