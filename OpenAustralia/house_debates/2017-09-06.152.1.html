        I'd like to talk about two upcoming forums in the wonderful electorate of Goldstein. On 12 September there will be two community planning forums held, in Highett and Beaumaris. They will be organised by the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         David Davis
        </a>
        , the state shadow minister for planning, and by the Liberal candidate for the seat of Sandringham at the 2018 state election, Brad Rowswell. The objective of these forums is to discuss the liability of the Bayside and Kingston areas given the alarming plan by the Victorian Labor government to radically shift planning regulations, to the detriment of the community. There has been a great deal of concern about the push for unlimited dwellings by the Andrews government, allowing up to 10 residences on a single block, and planning continues to be an important issue in the Bayside and Kingston communities in making sure the communities maintain control of their community and its character. In addition, the state government is talking about increasing height limits to 11 metres, allowing three storeys in general residential zones. Unsurprisingly, this justifies a planning forum and bringing together the community to raise concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of this campaign to make sure we hear from and listen to the community is Brad Rowswell, the state candidate, who is a fierce advocate for community safety and protecting the Bayside area from overdevelopment. He grew up in Beaumaris and cherishes its tree-lined streets, open parklands and beaches. Tragically, this is the thing that's under threat from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">

        state Labor government in Victoria. It's a misunderstanding about the importance of community and the natural assets we have in the Goldstein community and the Bayside and Kingston communities as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brad would also like to see more critical infrastructure in Victoria, including more car parking at train stations. That's important particularly at Sandringham train station, where a lot of people go to the end of the line for the opportunity to get into the city. He is also a strong advocate for the Bayside community and is listening to the concerns of local residents. That's why Brad will be a strong candidate and voice in the state parliament and follow the legacy of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Thompson
        </a>
        , who has been an outstanding representative for that community for many years. Brad brings a wealth of private and public sector experience working at senior levels of government, as well as the largest provider of independent education in the great state of Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Highett Community Planning Forum will be held at the Highett Bowls Club at 6 pm on 12 September. If you're in the Highett community, I strongly recommend that you attend. The Beaumaris Community Planning Forum will be held at the Beaumaris Community Centre hall at 8 pm on the same night, 12 September. Tragically I won't be there, because I'll be here in the federal parliament, but I encourage people in the Highett and Beaumaris communities to get along to those important forums. You can

        for them at bradrowswell.com.au. Brad is a truly exceptional candidate, and I thank him for the outstanding work he is doing in voicing the concerns of the Bayside, Kingston and Goldstein communities. May it, hopefully, be the beginning of many things to come.
