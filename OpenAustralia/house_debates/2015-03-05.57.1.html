       <p>
        Last Friday, I had the chance to attend a lunch at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
         Belvedere Hotel
        </a>
        put on by the Our Village Foundation. It was an Inspiring Women event. There were a few hundred people there to hear Turia Pitt, who was the guest speaker. For many Australians, Turia Pitt has become a name synonymous with resilience. Turia's life was overturned when she was trapped by a raging fire during a 100-kilometre ultramarathon event in the Kimberley in 2011. She suffered burns to 65 per cent of her body. In fact, her doctors said she was burnt so badly that she was almost cooked. It was incredible that she survived. Her story really is incredible. She went through years of recovery, in and out of hospital and plastic surgery.
       </p>
       <p>
        But what I found interesting is that Turia does not want to be as fit as she was before—she does not want to be as fit as she was when she was an ultramarathon runner; she wants to be fitter. I say to the people in my electorate, to everyone here in the gallery and to people listening today: what is it in your life that you are making excuses about? What is it in your life that you want to achieve?—because in this life, of course, we can do anything.
