VGen aims to ‘inspire, educate and empower young people in the fight against global poverty and injustice’ through fundraising and advocacy initiatives. In attendance were VGen chair, Miss Alana Smith, and vice chair, Mr Mark Cox. I congratulate Alana and Mark. I have met them on numerous occasions. They are exceptionally passionate, have a great vision and are fantastic ambassadors for VGen.

        The forum, which was held last Wednesday, 4 October 2006, was a great success. It provided an excellent opportunity for the young people of La Trobe to share their views with each other. Students from each school represented delivered presentations to the forum, voiced their opinions, passionately debated ideas and exchanged views. It was an incredible thrill to see how inspired our young people are to make poverty history. There was a real buzz in the room.

           World Bank
