        I advise the House that on 12 February I co-hosted 'An evening with the

        ' with the member for Curtin in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . We helped organise the event to raise awareness and build parliamentary support for the exciting plans to relocate the West Coast Eagles training base and administration base to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathlain_Park" rel="nofollow">

        in my electorate of Swan.
       </p>
       <p>
        As members would be aware, I have been working closely with the Eagles on this move for some time now, having publicly proposed it following the announcement of Burswood as the site for Perth's new stadium prior to the 2010 election. After all the hard work, it was a great moment to be able to progress to the point where we could showcase the plans to members of parliament in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event was well attended: we received 50
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP" rel="nofollow">

        s from members and senators and, despite some late divisions in this House, many members were determined to attend between votes. It was encouraging that the Minister for Sport was also present. I see the member for Fremantle in the chamber, and I suggest that she get on board with this issue as well, even though she might have allegiances elsewhere.
       </p>

        Players Nic Naitanui, who is Fiji's most famous export to Australia, and

        also attended and spoke about how the plans include a new headquarters for his foundation. This was particularly appropriate on the day parliament considered the Closing the Gap report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the Eagles and the players involved for coming to Canberra and for their professional presentation and attitude which was beyond reproach.
