       <p>
        This week is Organ Donor Awareness Week and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Kate Backhouse, a young woman in my electorate who has risen above the challenge of a double lung transplant and has gone on to raise thousands of dollars for Transplant Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today is not the first time I have spoken here about Kate and organ donation. It was Kate’s agonising wait for a double lung transplant in 2006 that brought the full reality of transplant waiting lists to my attention. I spoke then of the struggle of those on transplant waiting lists and noted with concern the low rate of organ donation in Australia. Fortunately, since then Kate has received the life-saving transplant she needed, and the energy and enthusiasm that she brings to every facet of her life is to be admired. She is a keen swimmer and has set her sights on the World Transplant Games this August.
       </p>
       <p>
        She is also an avid charity fundraiser. Two weeks ago she gave back to the cause with a Have a Heart black tie function at Rockhampton’s Kershaw House. The event was packed to the rafters and exceeded all expectations to raise a staggering $22,000, thanks to the local community and Kate. Kate tells me that, of the money raised, $13,000 will go to Transplant Australia and the remaining $9,000 will go to the Victorian Bushfire Recovery Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kate is working to see that Rockhampton has the highest number of citizens on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Organ_Donor_Register" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Organ Donor Register
        </a>
        of anywhere in the country, and I wish her every success with that aim. Australia’s organ donation rate is still too low and I take this opportunity in Organ Donor Awareness Week to encourage all those listening to register by visiting medicareaustralia.gov.au and also to inform their family of their decision.
