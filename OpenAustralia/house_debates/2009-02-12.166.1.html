        I wish to acknowledge the life of a beautiful little girl in my electorate of Forrest and pay tribute to her strength and generosity.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Davies" rel="nofollow">
         Claire Davies
        </a>
        was a brave 13-year-old girl from Capel who suffered from a complex cyanotic heart disease. Claire died in her sleep early on Saturday morning, 7 February, at home, surrounded by her close family. Her funeral is today, Thursday, 12 February, at the community hall in Capel. She will be farewelled by her close family: her father, Steve; her mother, Vicki; her older sisters, Cecelia and Bronwyn; and her 12-year-old brother, Mostyn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Claire defied the odds since being diagnosed with an extremely rare heart disease when she was just six weeks old. Claire packed a lot of activities into her short life. She played piano and was head girl at her school, Capel Primary School, in 2007. In 2008, she championed a number of events. She survived her fifth open heart surgery in January, a 12-hour surgical marathon that claimed her right leg and left her in a coma for two weeks, and she was chosen to be the Channel 7 Regional Telethon child in the telethon held in October 2008. She graciously took on the role and represented sick children throughout

        . I am told she also encouraged all regional areas to get behind her. She was excited to be part of the telethon fundraising event, and saw her wish come true when more than $7 million was raised for telethon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Claire was the junior bridesmaid at her sister Bronwyn’s wedding that took place on the very same weekend as the 2008 Channel 7 telethon. Claire would have turned 14 next month, on 9 March. The

        and telethon communities are in mourning at the very sad passing of Claire, and a public funeral is being catered for to honour her very short but special life. In keeping with Claire’s generosity of spirit, the family asked that instead of sending flowers, people could make donations to the cardiology unit at
