        It is again that time of year when those who live in a bushfire-prone area need to start paying serious attention to making sure they have a plan in the event of the worst occurring and a fire potentially threatening them, their family and their property. I have many parts of my electorate that are in bushfire-prone areas, and I urge not only my constituents but also people across the country who live in a bushfire-prone area to think very seriously that you have a plan if the unthinkable occurs. We know we can't ever predict the ignition of a bushfire, but just as importantly we also can't predict how quickly they can move and change course and so it's vital that everyone knows what they would do if the unthinkable occurs and they hear the news that their home, their property or where they happen to be is at risk of being subject to a bushfire threat.

        , and similar organisations in other states and territories that do such a fantastic job. They also provide excellent warnings as early as possible, and there is lots of technology available now that makes it even quicker and clearer as to when and how they communicate threats. Please, everyone who needs to, have a bushfire action plan, have a plan to get away from danger as quickly and as safely as you can as we enter fire season across the country.
