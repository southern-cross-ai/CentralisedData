        </a>
        are proposing to replace their existing air traffic control systems with a new civil-military air traffic management system being delivered under the OneSKY project to provide a common platform for provision of air traffic control in both civilian- and military-controlled airspace. Australia's OneSKY initiative will bring civilian and military air traffic control together under one air traffic management system for the first time, improving aviation efficiency and safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        To support this initiative, Defence is proposing to construct new or upgraded existing air traffic control towers, airfield systems complex buildings and sensor equipment to buildings at 13 Defence bases and five off-base Defence sites across Australia. Defence air traffic control services are for the purpose of preventing collisions between aircraft, between aircraft and obstructions, between aircraft and vehicles in the ground manoeuvring area and expediting and maintaining an orderly flow of air traffic within military-controlled airspace. The majority of the current air traffic control towers and airfield systems complex facilities were constructed in the 1960s and do not comply with current

        . These costs include all construction costs, management design fees, furniture fittings and equipment, contingencies and escalation allowances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in early 2016 at

        The Australian Defence Force is required to prevent, deter or respond to threat in a variety of environments. To achieve this, it requires vehicles which provide enhanced battlefield mobility and logistics support. The Department of Defence is proposing to provide new and refurbished infrastructure at eight locations across Australia for the acquisition of new vehicles for the

        </a>
        and joint logistics command units across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works include new maintenance workshops and associated repair part stores, weighbridges, loading and inspection ramps, wash points, fuel points, vehicle shelters and associated hardstandings. The project is valued at an estimated $276.5 million, excluding GST and includes construction costs, management design fees, furniture, information and communications technology, fitting and equipment, contingencies and escalation allowances. The main works will be delivered in the Townsville and Brisbane regions, with minor works being delivered near Sydney, Puckapunyal, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin. This capital investment in facilities will bring economic stimulus with expected opportunities for local subcontractors over the next three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to begin in early 2016, with staged practical completion occurring between late 2016 and 2019. I commend this motion to the House.

          In Blair, indeed. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Defence
          </a>
          is proposing to construct new facilities at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Air Force
          </a>
          Base Amberley in Queensland to support the introduction of 10 new C-27J battlefield airlifters aircraft and support systems for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          . The C-27J battlefield airlifter aircraft is replacing the Caribou aircraft which was retired from service in 2009 after a career spanning more than four decades. The flexibility of the C-27J allows it to undertake a wide range of missions, from delivering ammunition to front-line troops to undertaking aeromedical evacuation of casualties.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Battlefield Airlifter Facilities Project will provide modern, purpose-built facilities and improved infrastructure to support the operational readiness, security and capability requirements of No. 35 Squadron. The squadron's role includes conducting airlift operations from a range of rudimentary airstrips from battlefields to humanitarian missions in remote areas. The project includes a new headquarters building, hangars, a new apron which includes high masts and airfield ground lighting, hydrant refuelling points, maintenance and deployment facilities, new training facilities, space for flight and fuselage training simulators, and associated engineering and site works. The project will also construct facilities to replace functions displaced by the battlefield airlifter operational facilities and relocate a heritage building on the base.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government-approved budget for the Battlefield Airlifter Facilities Project is $380 million, excluding
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
           GST
          </a>
          . This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, construction and defence contingencies and information technology equipment. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in early to mid 2016, with all construction completed by early to mid 2018. The project will provide opportunities for growth and jobs throughout the construction period. I commend the motion to the House, and I am sure the member for Blair, sitting opposite, will agree with me.
