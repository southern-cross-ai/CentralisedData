        (d) that rather than protecting the environment, the replacement of the Galilee Basin's lower emission coal by higher emission coal from other countries could instead cause an increase in global emissions; and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) nationwide monitoring by the FWO has uncovered suspected exploitation in 20 per cent of 560 migrant Temporary Work (Skilled) visa (subclass 457) worker cases examined between October 2014 and January 2015;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the FWO said 'migrant workers complaints of mistreatment had soared in recent years, and sponsorship breaches were often deliberate acts of exploitation by unscrupulous employers';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) exploitation by employers has been identified in various industries including but not limited to construction, hospitality, cleaning, food processing, agriculture, the marketing and promotions sector, privately owned childcare centres and kindergartens, shopping trolley collectors and postal service contractors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) many of these workers are low paid and low skilled, and are on Temporary Work (Skilled) visas (subclass 457), Working Holiday visas (subclass 417) or student visas; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) this unconscionable conduct is widespread and is creating a sub class of workers that does not just hurt the employees; it puts at risk the pay and working conditions of all Australians;

        (2) acknowledges the:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) recent hard work of the FWO to monitor, investigate, and expose potential breaches of the work visa program and Australian workplace laws; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) proactive role the Australian union movement has played to highlight and expose unconscionable conduct by some employers and industries exploiting temporary visa workers;

       <p class="italic">
        (3) condemns the Government's:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) inaction to immediately address and implement the findings of recent FWO reports in relation to this matter; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recent moves to relax regulations for bringing in temporary visa workers, instead of toughening the rules; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately strengthen the work visa safeguards it has deliberately relaxed to make it easier for companies to hire overseas workers; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) ensure that Australia's work visa program has robust safeguards in place to protect all workers and is not being used as a back door avenue to source cheap labour.
