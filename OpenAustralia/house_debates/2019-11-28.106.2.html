        My question is to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister or his office brief Phil Coorey of the
        <i>
         Financial Review
        </i>
        that 'Morrison reported back to the House that he was not standing Taylor aside, basically because Fuller told him the investigation was not much more than a phone call to Moore's office'?

         I refer the member to my response that I tabled in this House as to the nature of my call with the commissioner of police, and I refer them also to the statements made by the commissioner about the contents of that call.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is the 64th time, I think, that those opposite have asked questions about this matter. That is four times the number of questions they have asked on drought and drought policy in this chamber since the election. It's more questions than they have asked on the economy. It's more than they've asked on child care. They've asked two questions on national security, three on education and six on health, but 64 on this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Do you know what it says about the Leader of the Opposition? He's more interested in the political games of Canberra than he is in the real issues that the people of Australia voted for us to focus on, and we're totally focused on those. I'm not distracted by the desperate political games of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition would rather be the Manager of Opposition Business than the Prime Minister, because he'd rather engage himself in all the silly little games and tantrums and sooking and sulking that we have seen from this Leader of the Opposition. But all of that comes to naught when you compare it with the depth of the tactics he stooped to today by silencing a veteran of this country.
