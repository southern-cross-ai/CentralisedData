        The electorate of Longman is full of many wonderful charities, community groups, organisations and people with hearts of gold who go out of their way to help and support the people who need it the most. Community groups and organisations like these help us pave our way towards strengthening and creating inclusive, connected, engaged and cohesive communities for everyone and anyone. Knowing that these groups exist within our community can also empower people to volunteer and to help out where they can. It can also encourage people to seek support and advice should they need it. Sometimes life can be overwhelming and sometimes we need support to tackle issues such as mental health, homelessness, drug habits, domestic violence, unemployment or the death of a loved one. These organisations provide a range of vital services dedicated to helping the people of Longman. As someone who's also made it his mission to improve the lives of the people of Longman, I share their vision and passion, because we can always lend a helping hand to help someone in need, whether it's providing a vital service to the elderly or people living with disability, volunteering or checking in on your neighbour. True community spirit goes a long way, and Longman has this in abundance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I visited a lot of community groups in the Longman electorate and look forward to visiting more of these groups to see the critical services they provide and the passion that drives them to do the things that they do. I'm grateful to see so many wonderful organisations in the electorate that exist to support and help others. One community organisation I would like to speak about today is Caboolture Meals on Wheels. This group has resided in the same building on Hayes Street, Caboolture, in the Longman electorate for the last 40 years, and they've done amazing work to help and serve the community. They do this by providing healthy and nutritious meals to not only elderly residents or people with a disability but anyone who wants to receive this service or even use them for cateringâ€”even you or me. This service provides great benefits to the elderly, people with disability and others in need, because sometimes the only person an elderly resident will see all day or even all week is a friendly volunteer from Meals on Wheels ready to deliver their food and have a quick chat. This will make their day and is something they look forward to. Sometimes residents living with disability will not have the facilities they need to cook for themselves. This vital service ensures that they get the nutritious meals they need to get through the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Caboolture Meals on Wheels also helps get people work-ready through Work for the Dole and volunteering. This can help get many people on the pathway to gaining employment and developing skills that will help them to retain and attain employment all while making a contribution to the community. On my recent visit I met many of these job hopefuls and volunteers, all led by their passionate leader, Rhondi McCosker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Caboolture Meals on Wheels is a shining example of what we need more of: kindness, compassion and determination to help people's lives get a little bit better, because you don't always know what people are going through. It's a toll it's taking, and you don't know their story.
