        Before speaking, I would like to acknowledge the words spoken by the member for Barker about the late Hon.

        and the kind things he had to say about a very distinguished career. I rise to acknowledge the 2019 Westfield Local Heroes community recognition program and congratulate three recipients of this program residing in my electorate of Wentworth. The Westfield Local Heroes program discovers and celebrates individuals who promote social wellbeing and cohesion in their communities. The finalists are nominated and voted for by their community, and each are awarded a $10,000 grant for their affiliated organisation. This funding aims to help recipients grow their programs and better connect and enrich the local communities in which they operate.

        First, I would like to acknowledge Westfield Scentre Group's

        and New Zealand, Westfield has awarded the title of local hero to 120 community leaders. This amounts to $1.2 million being distributed to the wider community to raise awareness of important social issues and recognise those in our community who give more than they take.

       <p>
        At just 20 years old, Rikki Stern received the life-changing diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. During her treatment journey, Rikki craved contact with others in her position but could not find community support for women her age. This inspired her to start Cancer Chicks, an Australian social media group that provides support to cancer sufferers based on shared experience. Today Cancer Chicks is a community of more than 300 Australian women aged between 20 and 30 years old. Rikki says that many of these women have experienced major surgeries and invasive treatment and had body parts removed or pregnancies terminated. She also says that, having lost hair, breasts and ovaries, many struggle with their identity and body image. To her credit, Rikki has created a safe and nurturing platform for women to share the highs and lows of what is an incredibly tough and confronting journey. Now cancer free, Rikki is more determined than ever. Cancer Chicks has now teamed up with Pink Hope, an organisation that focuses on the prevention of breast and ovarian cancer. I would like to thank Rikki for her courage and leadership in leading this movement.

        George Freund is another whose compassion and humility reflects the giving nature of the Australian spirit. George is a Holocaust survivor. His mother hid him in Budapest during the war. George's father was a regular volunteer at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COA" rel="nofollow">
         COA
        </a>
        Sydney, a drop-in centre which provides activities to facilitate healthy ageing and which happens to offer the only kosher Meals on Wheels service in Sydney. After his father passed away, George stepped into his father's volunteering duties and made an immediate impact within the organisation. Now in his 80s, George is still actively involved in managing the organisation, recruiting volunteers and assisting with meal deliveries. He says he has never forgotten that Australia took his family in as refugees and gave them a beautiful home. Financially, he says, he can't give much, but he is giving back tremendously in his own way. George attributes the award to all the hardworking volunteers at COA. He says community work is a reciprocal cycle of helping and being helped, giving and being given to. COA will use its grant to continue its Meals on Wheels program, which currently runs at a loss. George says COA does not allow anyone to go hungry, regardless of their ability to pay. I would like to thank George for his endless compassion and congratulate him on a very well deserved achievement.

       <p>
        I also wish to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Bello" rel="nofollow">
         Jose Bello
        </a>
        , an early childhood educator, who started Next Step in 2011. Next Step provides soccer skills for children with autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, as well as other medical conditions. As a former professional footballer, Jose understands the power of sport in bringing people together. To date, 350 children aged from three to eight have benefited from the free program, which many parents laud as a form of therapy for their kids. The program teaches new physical and cognitive skills and incorporates a range of physiotherapy exercises and gross motor training. Jose says that Next Steps doesn't just benefit the children but builds a secure and inclusive network for both parent and child. The foundation will use its grant to recruit more coaches and invest in much-needed specialist equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish Rikki, George and Jose all the very best in their future endeavours. Their generosity and dedication have touched the lives of many and will continue to have an impact.
