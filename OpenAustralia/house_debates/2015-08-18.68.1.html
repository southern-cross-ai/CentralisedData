        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister outline the importance of the 457 visa program and why it is important that its integrity is maintained?

         I thank the honourable member very much for his question. Australia, of course, was built on migration and the 457 program is important because it allows employers to fill skilled labour shortages where local workers cannot be found. Skilled overseas workers through the 457 visa program form an integral part of the economic machinery that creates Australian jobs by preventing skill shortages that limit the growth of our economy. The revelation that multiple trade unions have employed 457 visa holders is an act of incredible hypocrisy and duplicity given the long-term campaign the union movement has waged against the 457 program and now against the free trade agreement with China. So I went to have a look at the transcript of the ad which is running on television sets at the moment trying to scare people into believing that the free trade agreement is not good for this country. I had a look at the original transcript of this ad. I think members might be interested in the original transcript. It went something like this. Of course, there is a union boss within this scare campaign ad. The father is sitting there with his son and the father says, 'I can't believe they've done it.' The son says, 'Done what?' Dad says, 'The job I lined up for you at the union. It's been filled by a foreign worker.' 'But, Dad, the union's running a scare campaign against foreign workers.' Dad says, 'Believe it or not, son, the union's employed 41 457 workers, and the most frequently sponsored worker was the workplace relations adviser.' The irony, of course, is that we have seen the member for Gorton today get up here and try to trash the reputation of an honourable man. He got up here and failed to declare his own interest in this matter, because, as it turns out, this ad was authorised by M O'Connor—your brother. Who is he? He is the head of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, who owns and operates most of those people opposite.
