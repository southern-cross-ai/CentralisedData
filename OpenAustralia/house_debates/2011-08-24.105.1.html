       <p>
        I have said in this place a number of times that one of my big passions within the electorate of Chifley, where nearly a third of the people who live in the electorate are under the age of 19, is education. It stands at the forefront of the issues that I take a particular interest in within the electorate. This is in terms of not only public education but also the non-government sector, which is operating very well within the electorate. I am also pleased to see the growth of trade training schools. We had the pleasure of seeing the opening of the Tyndale Christian School's trade training centre recently, which will provide support for students learning the hospitality trade and getting involved in that trade, and seeing their last two years of secondary schooling being counted as an apprenticeship, which I think is a tremendous initiative that will ensure that students who want to move into a trade have support. I am very happy to see that. Obviously, the

        , my old university, is doing a lot of great work.

        Besides providing the opportunity for students to take on further education, they also need to turn up. They also need to balance out their education. By that I mean that their attendance is strong, that their engagement in school is strong and that they are engaging in healthy lifestyle and wellbeing, particularly through sport and taking up physical activity. It is for those very reasons that I was keen to see the federal government's $2 million No School No Play program rolled out in the seat of Chifley. There are about six schools in the electorate that I am really pleased have agreed to participate.

        Another pleasing aspect of what has gone on is the fact that we have been able to get private sponsorship, chiefly through Woolworths and a shareholder at the

        is participating in the scheme. Six schools in the Chifley electorate through the Chifley campuses, Plumpton High, St Clare's Catholic High School, and schools in Bidwell, Shalvey,

        and also Dunheved will take part in the program. For one hour a week over six weeks 120 students will engage in the sport and on the commitment that they will turn up to school that they will be engaged in school and that, through the support of Woolworths, they will have healthy breakfasts and snacks and learn the value of physical activity. It is a tremendous program. I am very happy that a number of people have banded together across corporate, school and community sectors to be involved. I commend the program. I am very happy with the support it has received so far and look forward to reporting on its progress.
