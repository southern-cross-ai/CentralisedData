        I rise today to acknowledge and thank the many dedicated people who run and volunteer in our community centres in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. It is the time of the year where many local community centres are having their annual general meetings and reflecting on the year that was. There are many community centres that offer many opportunities for local residents to get involved in a range of things. They provide a central, familiar location for people who receive important programs, services and activities.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_centres" rel="nofollow">
         Community centres

        in the south provide services such as adult leaning classes, playgroups and support groups as well as health and fitness programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you look at the quality and range of services offered by community centres across my electorate, there are so many examples of people going above and beyond to improve the lives of others. One example is the Participate and Learn Skills or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL" rel="nofollow">
         PAL
        </a>
        s program, which is offered at a number of local centres. PALs focuses on building life skills and promoting community engagement with primary school-age children. The program is aimed at children who are at risk of disadvantage, such as children with learning difficulties, children from difficult family situations and children with a disability. There are important assistance programs offered at the centres as well, such as the breakfast club that runs out of the Hackham West Community Centre. The program involves picking children up from their homes before school and bringing them to the centre to have a healthy, nutritious breakfast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even more than the service programs and activities offered, community centres are safe and welcoming places where everyone can feel a sense of belonging. They are a place to meet other people and to socialise. Particularly for disadvantaged members of our community, these centres play a vital role in pulling people out of social isolation and making them feel connected with the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout my years as the member for Kingston, I have met countless numbers of volunteers at these centres. These centres are run by volunteers. These centres have volunteers involved in every aspect of their day-to-day running, so I would like to particularly thank those people. There's the Aldinga Community Centre, Christie Downs Community House, the Cove Civic Centre, Elizabeth House and Wakefield House, Hackham West Community Centre, Reynella Neighbourhood Centre, Seaford Community Centre, Trott Park Neighbourhood Centre, Woodcroft Morphett Vale Neighbourhood Centre and the Neporendi Aboriginal Forum. These are just some of the amazing community centres that offer great social support and services our community. I would like to thank sincerely all of those who play a part in making these community centres great.
