        Last week, I attended two Christmas functions of very special groups. One was the Swansea Pensioners Association and the other was Eastlakes Legacy Widows. At the Swansea Pensioners group, I learned that Theresa Parkinson, who has been the long-term secretary of that group, had retired. Tribute was paid to her by the group. She has been a driving force in that group and it is a very strong, successful group. They meet on the first Thursday of every month at the Swansea Pensioners Hall. I thank her for her commitment to the pensioners. I thank her for all the assistance that she has given me over the years and I know that she is still going to remain an active member of the pensioner group. Eastlakes Legacy Widows is a strong group of women whose partners have died and who now have the support of Legacy. The group has shrunk in numbers over the years, and I find that very sad, but I have some wonderful friends there. They are fantastic women who know how to organise a great time. They are women who give support to each other and spend time together outside their standard meetings. Both groups are very strong. They support each other and will continue to do so.
