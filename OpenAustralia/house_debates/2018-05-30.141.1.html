       <p>
        I'm a passionate advocate for mental health services for all Australians and am proud to be part of the Turnbull government, which is committed to providing access for all Australians to the services they may need to support their mental health and wellbeing. The Turnbull government are investing over $4.3 billion in mental health services this year, and we are making significant investments in early intervention services and a range of national programs to support Australians in need. Central to this aim is the development and current expansion of the network of headspace services. Headspace provides a youth-friendly environment for young people aged 12 to 25 years to access support for mental health and other concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The electorate of Chisholm embraces the Eastern Melbourne Public Health Network region and receives annual funding of $2.9 million for the commissioning of headspace services. The public health network currently commissions headspace services in south-eastern Melbourne, with young people being able to access headspace services at various locations. The headspace network of services provides holistic care for young people aged between 12 and 25 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, the Eastern Melbourne Public Health Network commissions the Youth Engagement Treatment Team Initiative, which provides extra staff to support more young people with or at risk of severe and enduring mental illness. And the public health network is currently working with local service providers and the community to establish a youth health hub which provides a central point of contact for young people to access mental health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        For young people across Chisholm and indeed across Australia, eheadspace is also available. Eheadspace provides free, confidential and anonymous telephone and web based services to young people aged 12 to 25 years with or at risk of developing mild to moderate mental illness. From feedback I've received, eheadspace is often the preferred form of access for confidential counselling, and eheadspace can be contacted by telephone on 1800650890, which is a free call, or via the internet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, a key budget initiative is $338.1 million in new mental health funding where there is a focus on suicide prevention. An additional one million people will receive diagnosis, treatment and recovery through a new Million Minds Mission in mental health research, with funding of $125 million over the next decade. There is also $110 million additional investment in child and youth mental health services, with a focus on providing mental health services to children within the school setting, which is so important. Finally, in addition, the Turnbull government recently announced that it would provide $33.8 million to Lifeline to significantly boost their telephone crisis service, helping them to support hundreds and thousands of Australians in need.
