        I want to take this opportunity in the House to highlight some fantastic community events in the electorate over last couple of weeks. First of all, The Gap Lions Club celebrated the opening of their new storage shed. This has been a long-awaited project, which has gone down quite a few dry gullies. It's taken a lot of perseverance, but they got there. I'm happy to have supported this project with a $4,000 grant as part of the Morrison government's Stronger Communities Program.
       </p>

        Brookfield State School celebrated their 150th anniversary, a significant milestone for any school, and I want to congratulate all the students who showcased their talent on the day to make sure that it was a very memorable occasion.
       </p>
       <p>
        My local area is also home to a large defence community with the

        . I was honoured to attend the opening of the 42 for 42 Afghanistan Memorial Garden. This is going to be a wonderful place to honour not only the 41 fallen soldiers from Afghanistan but also those who died subsequently from suicide. It's going to be a tremendous place of reflection for the community. I want to thank Sean and the whole 42 for 42 team for what they've done.

        held their celebration, with the Mandalay Progress Association Jacaranda Festival. Congratulations to Joseph and his team, who put on a fantastic afternoon of food, music and drinks, ending with a movie in the parkâ€”a great way to bring the community together during these COVID times.
       </p>

        Finally, I want to congratulate The Gap Scout Group on 70 years of operation looking after young people in our community, providing guidance and leadership for them and their families. Theo and I particularly enjoyed this one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to all those community groups.
