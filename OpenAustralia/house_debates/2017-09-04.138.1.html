       <p>
        A lot has happened in my electorate of Lyons over the past week, some of it good and some of it bad. First I would like to offer my formal thanks to Triabunna District School students Declan Draper and Jayden Silver, along with their mate Dan, whose quick thinking last Tuesday saved 85-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McCrary" rel="nofollow">
         Jim McCrary
        </a>
        from an uncertain end. The boys had been on the town's wharf when they saw Mr McCrary's car drive off the wharf and into the water. Mr McCrary had been attempting a U-turn but had hit the accelerator instead of the brake. Declan and Jayden hopped into a dinghy and headed out to the half-submerged vehicle. Dan, meanwhile, got onto the roof of the car and put a rope around Mr McCrary, and then the boys pulled him onto the boat.
       </p>
       <p>
        It turns out that Declan, who's 15, is an old hand at rescue. He previously received a bravery award for saving someone from drowning at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Leake" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , further up the east coast and also in my electorate. The boys and Mr McCrary caught up the next morning for a photo and to see the car being winched out of the water. It was a lovely photo by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania_Police" rel="nofollow">

        and captured the spirit of the youth of Tasmania alongside a member of the older generation. I'm sure I speak for all here when I say thank you to Declan, Jayden and Dan, who are handy boys to have around, and wish Mr McCrary all the best. We look forward to his next visit to Triabunna being a little bit warmer and a little bit drier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now we come to a less happy story. I won't say too much as the issue is before the courts, but I would like to express in this place my sadness, my regret and my anger at a shooting that took place in Deloraine which injured 11-year-old Phoenix Newitt. The prayers and thoughts of all Tasmanians are with Phoenix as she recovers in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Children's Hospital
        </a>
        in Melbourne, where she is being treated after having suffered injuries to her face, neck, skull and heart. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that Phoenix emerged from her five-day coma early yesterday morning and immediately asked for her mother, Sarah, who is with her. I am led to understand that Phoenix may suffer some hearing loss, but fears of brain injury and loss of balance have receded.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the fact is that Phoenix is an 11-year-old child who was grievously wounded due to no fault of her own and due to the actions of an adult who made a decision to discharge a weapon in her vicinity. These are facts not in dispute. Phoenix had been sitting in the back seat of a car with her four-year-old cousin while her mother and uncle were in the front seat. A 25-year-old man has been charged, so I won't say more about the alleged circumstances, but I do look forward to justice taking its course.
       </p>
       <p>
        After being shot, Phoenix was initially taken to the Deloraine Medical Centre and then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        , but it was decided her best hopes lay with specialists in Melbourne. I would like to thank all emergency services personnel and police for the magnificent efforts they have made for her ongoing care. Phoenix, we wish you all the best and we look forward to seeing you home soon.

         On behalf of the House, could you pass on our appreciation to Declan, Jayden and Dan for their great contribution.
