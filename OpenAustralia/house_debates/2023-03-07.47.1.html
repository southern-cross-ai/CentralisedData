        My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness. How are the Albanese Labor government's housing reforms improving the supply of affordable rentals for Australians, and what are the risks of these reforms not passing the parliament?

         I thank the member for Moreton for his important question, because he knows, like all of us on this side of the House, that too many Australians are making tough decisions around their kitchen tables. We know that many are struggling with increasing interest rates and, of course, rising rents, and we have all seen the data today. Indeed, too many Australians are paying the price from the former government that did very little when it comes to social and affordable homes. The former government didn't believe the Commonwealth had any role to play in addressing the housing needs of Australians that need it most. And it seems that some opposite still believe that. Indeed, our government believes that every Australian deserves a safe, affordable place to call home. We were elected with a plan to tackle the housing challenges, including for those experiencing rental stress.

           The establishment of the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will build 30,000 homes in the first five years. We're talking about 20,000 social homes and, importantly, 10,000 affordable rentals for key workers. Add to this the 20,000 affordable homes that will be delivered under the national accord, in partnership with the states, territories and local government; that's 10,000 affordable homes from the federal government and another 10,000 matched by the states and territories. I'm talking about homes like the ones we announced in Westmead last year for key workers. We heard there, importantly, from Elisa Ting, a midwife, who's already in an affordable rental being managed. She said: 'The original market value rent is $450, and I'm paying $322 a week. So it's a huge difference. I honestly thought it was fake at first, because I was like, "No wayâ€”it can't be that cheap."'

             We know there are thousands of people currently struggling with increasing rents, and we know that our reforms and the Housing Australia Future Fund will make a real difference to thousands of people around the country today. Indeed, I am pleased our legislation has received such strong support from many in this place and on the crossbench, and of course the member for Bass. They know it's providing national leadership on affordable housing. As National Shelter has said, it provides 'a strategic approach to housing policy that's been lacking for some time'. Indeed, I'm astounded that those opposite continue to be opposed, that they continue to say no to building more homes for rentals for people like Elisa.

They continue to say no to a reform that we made known to the people prior to the last election. Our ambitious housing reform will deliver on our policy to the Australian people.

                 I'm asked about our shared equity scheme that we announced in Perth, and a shared equity scheme is exactly that. That's the hint: it's shared, and there's equity. Instead of having 100 per cent of the mortgage yourself, you'll have a shared equity scheme, such as those operated in WA for a long period of time, of 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent. That's the way shared equity works; that's why the
