        It is with great pleasure that I ask my question to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline what action the government is taking to support the ongoing success of Australia's $60 billion agriculture sector? Is he aware of any threats that stifle opportunities for hardworking Australian businesses and households?

         I thank the honourable member for her question and note that, during the proper process of making sure that we went about letting the High Court make its deliberations, and I accept their verdict, and during the by-election, I had the opportunity to get around the electorate—and we see so much that is happening in agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have seen that table grapes, since 1 December 2017—or since we've been in power, since 2013—have gone up by 276 per cent. We have seen cattle, yearling heifers, go up by 150 per cent. We've seen mutton go up by 125 per cent and potatoes go up by 112 per cent. We've seen the biggest turnaround in the agricultural economy, by reason of the good fortune of international markets and the good management of a coalition government. We have put over $4 billion together—we have put money on the table for an agricultural white paper.
        </p>
        <p>
         You asked if there are threats. Of course, there are a number of threats. The threats are that the Labor Party does not believe in dams—I know you've got Rookwood Weir in your electorate, but the Labor Party does not believe in dams. They do not believe in a better nation and a stronger nation. They do not believe in the inland rail. They've put no money on the table for the inland rail. They did not believe in the live cattle trade when they shut it down. They do not believe in going out into regional areas to provide the things we have provided, such as the mobile phone towers that are so vitally important, such as the Building Better Regions Fund and such as the national Regional Growth Fund. We have provided 100 per cent write-off for fences and water, and a write-off over three years for grain storage.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've done all these things. And we believe in a decentralisation agenda, which we know the Labor Party doesn't believe in. But the biggest threat, I can say to the member for Capricornia, is one of trust. Once more, I come back and see the back of the head of the member for Maribyrnong, because they do not trust him. They do not trust him, because of the absolutely incredible position where we had the member for Watson come to this despatch box and up to 11 times try to gag us—while they were using those numbers, the member for Batman was voting with them. Senator Gallagher was speaking on their behalf. We also, here, see right now that we have the member for Braddon, the member for Longman and the member for Fremantle.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an opposition that cannot be trusted, led by a man who cannot be trusted. He has shown that he will turn his back on the Australian people and he will turn his back on proper process. And since the end of October, when he led the fourth estate around by the nose because they trusted him, they've believed him. But he's a man who can't be believed. Now we've seen, since the end of October, it's quite black and white. Their only excuse, they say, is that they haven't got their paperwork back. How does that work? Do you drive on a highway without a licence because you believe it's in the mail? I don't think so. Yet these people will continue to vote. I can tell you one good thing: the people of New England gave you a vote—
