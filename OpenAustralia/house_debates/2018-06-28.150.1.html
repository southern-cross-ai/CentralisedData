         The Order

        of Australia is awarded to Australians who have made a significant contribution to the lives of their community or who have made outstanding achievements in their given fields. Since it was introduced by Queen Elizabeth

        in 1975, the hard work and achievements of more than 30,000 Australians have been recognised and celebrated. I'm always delighted to have the chance to reflect on the hard work, service and diverse accomplishments of Australians. Several Berowra constituents were recently inducted into the order, and today I'd like to take the opportunity to recognise their service and offer my congratulations.

       <p>
        Finally, I want to acknowledge and recognise Jeanette Farrell of Northmead, who, again, isn't a Berowra local but who worked for my predecessor

       <p>
        All these people have made a significant contribution to our nation. Some are local heroes and others have had an impact globally. All of them are inspirations, and I'm very pleased that their achievements have been acknowledged in this particular way.
