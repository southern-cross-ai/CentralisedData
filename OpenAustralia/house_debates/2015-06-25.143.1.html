        In Australia, our governments over the years have always taken the attitude and responsibility that we should care for those of us who are struggling with unemployment and other issues. As a result, we have a comprehensive welfare system that reaches most people. Unfortunately, sometimes what we see is the money that is allocated to families for the welfare of their children and the welfare of the women in the house is being used for other things such as alcohol, gambling and the purchase of drugs.

        Over the years, and certainly in my 7½ years as a member of this place, we have struggled with different ways to address this inequity. One of the things that has been mentioned of late is the use of a welfare card, whereby recipients receive a large percentage of their welfare payment for that household—child support and unemployment benefits or whatever else—on the card, with an amount of cash that would obviously be used at the person's discretion. This card would look like any other credit card; it would not hold the recipient out as being anything noticeable, but could be used to purchase a whole range of things. The only places it could not be used at would be places where you can purchase alcohol,

        s or in locations where there is gambling.

        Around Australia there are some trial sites being considered by the government. One of those is in Moree, and there are discussions going on with the community there. There have been for some time, and there was another discussion yesterday. I just want to reiterate that this will not happen if the community does not get behind it; however, I would also encourage the community to open their eyes to the possibility that this might work. One of the reasons why Moree has been chosen is that the welfare recipients in Moree are about fifty-fifty Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. The last thing I would ever support is a measure that was based on race, but this is a measure that is based on trying to improve the welfare and wellbeing of those in our society who need our care the most. The discussions will be ongoing in Moree. A decision has not been made, but hopefully we will soon get to that point.
