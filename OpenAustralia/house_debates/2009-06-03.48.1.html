         I thank the member for Blair for his question. I know that he takes an interest in question time every day. What is different today is that we have seen an uncharacteristic interest in question time by the member for Higgins, who interjected during the last question: ‘Is that it?’ Interestingly, it is exactly the same question people are asking about his political career. We will wait for the answer; we will know that very soon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Blair asked me about a happier topic than the future of the member for Higgins. He asked me about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Building the Education Revolution
         </a>
         . I know that the member for Blair supports the projects in his electorate and he is well in touch with his local schools, and I know that he is staying in touch with this program right around the nation, where the Building the Education Revolution has funded over 15,000 infrastructure projects valued at over $4.1 billion already. That has been done through round 1 of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
          Primary Schools
         </a>
         for the 21st Century program, in which 1,499 Australian schools were successful in having 2,010 projects approved, totalling $2.8 billion, and under rounds 1 and 2 of the National School Pride program, in which 9,490 Australian schools were successful in having 13,176 projects approved, totalling $1.3 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we have seen the opposition in denial about a series of things. They are in denial about the contribution of economic stimulus to the national accounts; they are generally, apart from the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          North Sydney
         </a>
         , in denial about the contribution of economic stimulus to supporting Australian jobs; and they are also in denial about the importance of the Building the Education Revolution and they are known to refer to it as ‘reckless spend’ or a ‘poor quality spend’. I would ask them to listen to the words of people who actually know about education and the importance to education of modern quality facilities. I refer the House to a letter I received on 25 May 2009 from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">

         of the Box Hill High School Council. That school received $200,000 under round 1 of the National School Pride program. She was very keen to convey her views as an educator about the importance of quality school buildings. She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I would like to share with you some of the changes in behaviour and attitude that have occurred as a result of new facilities in that school.
        </p>
        <p>
         She goes on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The children and staff are taking pride in their school environment. Graffiti is less. The amount of rubbish left in the yard at recess and lunch time is significantly less. Kids are flocking to the new facilities, using the new gallery and library and using the new gym.
        </p>

         She goes on to say:

         The funding has made a huge difference in terms of how our school community feels. We feel valued, special and proud of our school—

           These are the words of a school principal who wrote to me. The member for Mackellar might like to reflect on that before she interjects.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have also received a letter from Vicki Rose Graydon, the Principal of Glenleighden School in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_Tree_Pocket" rel="nofollow">
            Fig Tree Pocket
           </a>
           in Queensland. I note that that school is in the electorate of Ryan. In her letter Ms Graydon says:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           As a small special school educating students with severe primary language disorder, this funding—
          </p>
          <p>
           that is, $850,000—
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           is vitally needed to construct a building to house a library as well as our multipurpose rooms to be used for therapy and manual arts. Our plans are close to being finalised and we look forward to being able to commence construction in the next couple of months. Thank you again for providing funding which enables the Glenleighden School to achieve its mission of supporting children and young people with language disorders to reach their educational and personal potential.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is a very moving statement. I note, though, that on 4 February the member for Ryan put out a press release which stated that Labor’s second stimulus package which delivered the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
            Building the Education Revolution
           </a>
           program is an example of reckless spending at a time when we should be acting prudently. I trust the member for Ryan has got the guts to go to the special school in his electorate and explain his views about how the refurbishments and changes that are being funded by the Building the Education Revolution program at his school are an example of a reckless spend. Obviously, the opposition continue to be in denial about the importance of the Building the Education Revolution program. They are in denial about the impact of economic stimulus on the national accounts. They are in denial about the impact of economic stimulus on supporting jobs and, more than anything else, they are in denial about what the member for Higgins plans next.
