       <p>
        I wish to extend the condolences of this House, particularly of the member for Rankin; the Mayor of Redland;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Robinson" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Robinson
        </a>
        , the state member; and Councillor Craig Ogilvie for the events on the weekend at Redland Spring Festival, where we lost a beautiful young pregnant mum in a completely unforeseen and almost impossible to contemplate accident on Saturday afternoon at 4.45. The events are just impossible for us, after the event, to reconcile. This was a family who was visiting our festival in our community. We feel we owed her and her family a duty of protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope that no-one will find individual factors of blame or reflect on age as a cause of this terrible accident. I do reassure everyone that there was not a moment where everything was not done to save this incredibly precious life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was about 20 metres away when it happened and there were 20 minutes during which we did everything until the ambulance arrived. It is very hard for us to contemplate options and run them through our minds, but that is exactly what many of us are doing.
       </p>
