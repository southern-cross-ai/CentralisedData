        I rise to speak about the Bunbury branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        , which is celebrating 80 years of existence. On 26 May 1929 eight ladies met at the Bunbury council chambers and decided that a CWA branch should be formed in Bunbury. Mrs Leslie Craig was elected as the inaugural president at its first meeting. Initially, meetings were conducted at various places offered to them by the public, but permanent ‘rest rooms’ were definitely needed. In 1930 a small parcel of land in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Wellington Street
        </a>
        was leased from the railways department, and Bunning Bros were contracted to build the rest rooms at a cost of ₤237.17. The grand opening of these rooms and the first meeting were held on 26 October 1931. Since that time numerous alterations, improvements and extensive additions, including a new kitchen, have been completed. These are greatly appreciated by all members, visitors and those who use the rooms.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2008 the Bunbury branch purchased a magnificent wooden fireplace from CWA House in Perth. It has been placed in the foyer for everyone to see and enjoy as they enter the rooms. When the Bunbury council decided to construct the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Bicentennial Square
        </a>
        , the land and rooms were in jeopardy. Through the efforts of Dr Ern Manea in 1988 the property, land and building was vested to the Bunbury branch of the CWA as an historic site. The rooms are open every Tuesday, when members gather for meetings, either for business or social purposes or craft activities. Visitors are always welcome, and of course there is always a cup of tea and great food. Some outside groups also use the comfort of the CWA rooms. Flowers for Friendship, where members make and hand out floral button holes to local shoppers and visitors, an annual church service, conducted in the rooms, and outings with sister branches of Thornleigh are highlights of the branch’s year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fundraising is ongoing, and donations are made to various clubs and organisations annually. Toys are made for the ambulance, hospital and fire brigade services, and comfort items are made for regional nursing homes and the women’s refuge. Volunteering is a high priority, with members always willing to help whenever needed. Ten members regularly visit nursing homes and hospitals in Bunbury and surrounding areas to entertain the residents with singing, piano duets and stories. On 30 June this year, Bunbury branch will celebrate its 80th birthday with a civic reception and luncheon, which, hopefully, state officers will attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        The girls inform me that CWA actually stands for ‘chicks with attitude’, and I wish them all the best.
