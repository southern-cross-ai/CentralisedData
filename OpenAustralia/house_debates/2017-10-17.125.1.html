        The annual Australian Goanna Pulling Championships were held in Wooli recently. I can allay any concerns you may have, Deputy Speaker, and say that no goannas were injured during this event. The sport of goanna pulling is a test of strength between two contestants who get down on all fours, linked by a leather belt around their heads. The aim is to pull backwards, dragging the opponent across the line, tug-of-war style. I not only had the pleasure of attending this great event but also had the opportunity to open it and step onto the mound to test my own goanna-pulling technique against local Bob McPherson. I'm very happy to tell you that my goal of leaving uninjured was achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event has been held for 32 years. This year's event was opened by Trevor Collins. I'd like to thank the Wooli community who volunteered their time and made the day a great success: Wayne Tank Phillips, and I thank Tank for his tip of stay low and keep your arm strong; Michelle Kellett; President Kellie Blacksell; Secretary Kirra Mcfarlane; Treasurer Leanne Plowman; as well as the rest of the committee and many local businesses who support the day through sponsorship. It was a well-attended family day out with other highlights, such as woodchopping and tug of war. Congratulations to Wooli.

        Twelve-year-old Isaac Barker from South Grafton has recently returned from representing

        Rugby Union championships in Darwin. His team was victorious and, after playing three games in two days, they left Darwin as the undefeated champions. Isaac earned his way onto the side after playing for the

        in the PSSA titles.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not just on the union field that Isaac has shown his versatility and potential. The South Grafton Public School Captain has also represented the North Coast in rugby league,

        and athletics. Isaac is currently in Sydney to compete in the New South Wales State Athletic Championships later in the week. I acknowledge his mother Kathryn and father Jason, who continue to support Isaac in his passions for the sports.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to congratulate Celia Sullohern, who recently won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Marathon" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
