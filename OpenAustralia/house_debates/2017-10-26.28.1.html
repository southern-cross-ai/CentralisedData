       <p>
        Today I'd like to acknowledge the first-year anniversary of the tragedy that occurred at Dreamworld on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        in my electorate, to pay my respects to the victims and their families and also to the Dreamworld staff and guests who were present on that day. Like so many Australians, I was deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life at a theme park, a place of fun. My heartfelt prayers and sincere condolences go to the families of the three Canberrans, Kate Goodchild, Luke Dorsett and Roozi Araghi, and to the Central Coast's Cindy Lowe. I also praise the courage and skill of the first responders on the scene who tried desperately to save and resuscitate those who had such grievous injuries. In particular, I praise Mr Shane Green, the manager of the first-aid department at Dreamworld, for his courageous efforts and recognise the profound impact that fateful day has had on him.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also aware that the findings of the official investigation into the tragedy are yet to be handed down, but Dreamworld, of course, has invested in safety to ensure that it becomes one of the safest theme parks in the world. Dreamworld employs over a thousand people in my electorate and, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet'n'Wild" rel="nofollow">
         Wet'n'Wild
        </a>
        and other theme parks, is one of its major employers. Whilst the tragedy must be examined and victims always remembered, the role of amusement and theme parks goes on. So I encourage all Australians: if you're down at the Gold Coast, pop into Dreamworld, pay your respects, take the family out for a great day and enjoy all that our modern theme parks have in a safe environment.
