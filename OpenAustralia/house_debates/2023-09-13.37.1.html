        The Australian Conservation Foundation's Wild At Art competition is on. Over recent weeks, young people from across the

        electorate have been sharing their creations with my office. As much as we love seeing the artwork, it's the stories each work tells that leaves a lasting impression. They tell it loud and clear: children of North Sydney care deeply about the future of Australia's threatened plants and animals and their disappearing homes. For these kids, the link between wildlife and its habitat is crystal clear. But I fear this government is not making the same connection.

With over 61 threatened species identified across my electorate, we must all accept that we are out of time and we cannot afford to fail any more tests.
