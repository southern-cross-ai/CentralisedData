        community in my electorate has always demonstrated a selfless community spirit. Last weekend was no exception, with local residents joining together to support two major fundraising events for exceptionally worthwhile causes. The first was held on Saturday at

        Catholic Primary School to raise money for our rural communities experiencing the devastating drought. With an incredible spread that would have done the

        proud, 150 people came together to help raise $22,000. All these funds are being donated to support Drought Angels. I would like to thank Roslyn Carberry and

        and their team for the time and effort given to arranging the fundraiser, as well as St Michael's for making their school facilities available and Jacky Barker for promoting the day through In the Cove.

        On Sunday morning, a different type of event was held: the third annual Lane Cove Fun Run. 'Fun' and 'run' are two words I wouldn't normally combine, so I was delighted to again be asked to fire the starting gun for the five-kilometre race rather than to don running gear. This important event continues to grow, and around 2,000 people participated this year—a record number. Over $30,000 was raised for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Cove_Public_School" rel="nofollow">

        and two children's charities,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIDS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and The Pyjama Foundation. That is an incredible achievement. Special thanks go to the race director, Katie Sykes, and the team of volunteers who support the fun run—sadly, far too many for me to mention today. For everyone organising and participating over the weekend, thank you for your contribution and for nurturing the vibrant and generous heart of the Lane Cove community.
