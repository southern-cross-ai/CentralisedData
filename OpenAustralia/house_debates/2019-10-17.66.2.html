        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House why it's important for the Morrison-

        </a>
        government to provide a stable and certain approach to the delivery of critical infrastructure, including through the $100 billion infrastructure pipeline, and is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         Following on from the minister for drought in talking about working hand in hand with the state governments: that's what we do on this side. That's what we as Liberals and Nationals do. We want to work hand in hand with governments that want to work with us. Indeed, just yesterday, the Victorian parliament in their question time talked about the relationship that they have with us to build projects. I know the Prime Minister is going to meet with Premier Andrews very soon. That's what we want to do. We don't care what political persuasion they are. If there is a project that needs building, we want to get on and build it—just like we want to get on and help those drought-stricken farmers.

         's electorate, there is section D of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         . Section D runs from Cooroy to Curra. It's an integral link, particularly for freight, but it's also making sure that people get home sooner and safer. This section alone will almost double the current capacity of the highway between Woondum and Curra and will remove 53 intersections and nine sets of traffic lights. That's delivery. I know the member for Wide Bay has fought, campaigned and advocated hard for this project. In the construction phase, along with the considerable amount of money we're putting on the Bruce Highway, it's going to create jobs, it's going to create opportunities and it's going to increase freight supply chains. Bypassing Gympie will mean 50 per cent fewer trucks travelling through the centre of town, separating long-distance travellers from local traffic. This is how you transform the way people travel.

         We're getting on, with $100 billion over the next decade for investment in infrastructure. We're getting things done with the states, with any states that are willing to build dams with us, to build the Inland Rail or to make sure we get on and build the roads of the future. Building a better future—that's the Liberal and the Nationals way.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm asked by the member for Wide Bay if there are any alternatives. We're spending $9.8 billion on infrastructure in this 12-month period, and we're working towards surplus. That's something that those opposite could only dream about. In the other place, Senator Claire Chandler wasn't even born the last time Labor produced a budget surplus. When you have budget surpluses, you can build more infrastructure. That's how it works. As any good businessperson knows, when you make more money than you spend, you can get on and you can build things. You can expend money on capital equipment. You can, as a government, build more infrastructure, and that's what we're doing. I know that the opposition leader, when he was the infrastructure minister in the Gillard and Rudd years, would have loved to have the sort of money that we're investing in infrastructure. I know he could only have dreamt of that.
