        I present the reports of the Australian parliamentary delegation bilateral visit to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of South Africa
        </a>
        from 28 April to 4 May 2006 and the 114th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Nairobi from 5 to 12 May 2006. It is a great privilege to be able to represent this parliament at the Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences and also at the bilateral visits that accompany those conferences. This was a particularly productive and successful delegation. I am grateful to members of the delegation, including the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Fowler, who will speak on the bilateral visit to South Africa. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Mrs Kay Hull, the member for Riverina, and I am delighted to inform the House that my colleague was elected unanimously by the Asia-Pacific geopolitical group to the position of Titular Member of the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians. This is an outstanding outcome, and I congratulate and thank Kay for her dedication to the task of representing women’s issues on behalf of the Australian delegation, as she has done at these last three assemblies. I must say that this builds on the work of previous delegates such as Mr Somlyay and Mrs Vamvakinou, and Senators Ferris,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKiernan" rel="nofollow">
         McKiernan
        </a>
        and Chapman. The delegation that went to Nairobi participated constructively and enthusiastically, and I think we did great justice to the work of previous people from this House who have previously attended the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        assembly.
       </p>
       <p>
        My contribution today will focus on the work of the delegation at the 114th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Nairobi in May this year. One of the debates conducted at the IPU is the general debate, which this year had the theme of promoting democracy and helping to build democratic institutions. I think we in Australia can see just how important that is in the region around us. I participated in this debate and spoke on the role of the Australian government in encouraging and promoting good governance in the Asia-Pacific region. We do have an excellent track record there.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IPU also has three standing committees which debate and draft a resolution on an issue of importance. Mrs Irwin, the member for Fowler, participated in the First Standing Committee (Peace and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security" rel="nofollow">
         International Security
        </a>
        ) debate on ‘The role of parliaments in strengthening control of trafficking in small arms and light weapons and their ammunition’. Senator Marshall participated in the Second Standing Committee (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development" rel="nofollow">
         Sustainable Development
        </a>
        , Finance and Trade) debate on ‘The role of parliaments in environmental management and in combating global degradation of the environment’. The member for Riverina and the member for Fowler participated in the Third Standing Committee (Democracy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        ) debate on ‘How parliaments can and must promote effective ways of combating violence against women in all fields’.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IPU is known for the work that it does in relation to women parliamentarians and, as I said, we were all delighted at the member for Riverina being elected to the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians. One of the main areas of interest for this IPU conference included a topical panel discussion on

        </a>
        , which all delegates took the opportunity to attend, which included an excellent contribution from Mr Stephen Lewis,

        , who focused on the devastating impact of AIDS on children in Africa. It was a very sobering panel discussion. The meeting of the IPU also allows delegates to hold informal meetings, and we met with Mr Amir Dossal.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, may I commend my fellow delegates for their work at this IPU assembly, which is recorded in detail in the report I have just tabled, and may I also place on record our thanks to those people in this parliament, in

         I am pleased to follow the member for Pearce on her tabling of the report on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
          IPU
         </a>
         conference held in Nairobi, Kenya, and the bilateral visit by the delegation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
          Republic of South Africa
         </a>
         . I firstly congratulate the member for Pearce on her leadership of the delegation and on the fine work she has been doing in enhancing Australia’s profile within the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I congratulate my fellow delegate the member for Riverina. Congratulations, Kay, on the wonderful lobby job that you did. I also congratulate my colleague and comrade Senator Gavin Marshall. I congratulate my other colleagues on their excellent contributions to the proceedings of the IPU conference.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to focus on what was a most important bilateral delegation to South Africa. As members would be aware, South Africa has undergone significant change in the decade since the end of apartheid. One pleasing aspect of the visit was the recognition given to Australia and the trade union movement for our support for the case to bring about the changes to the apartheid regime in South Africa. We were reminded of that on our arrival at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Richards Bay
         </a>
         , where we were greeted by about 20 people demonstrating against industrial relations laws in Australia. But in spite of our record of support in the dark days of apartheid and since, and despite the strong sporting links, there is a level of misunderstanding between the two countries. I would hope that our visit and other initiatives will bring about a better understanding of each country’s role in world affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
         South Africa has a significant trade relationship with Australia, and the delegation had the opportunity to visit the destination of our largest volume of exports at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
          BHP
         </a>
         Billiton aluminium smelter at Richards Bay. South Africa imports over $600 million worth of Australian aluminium each year. In return, Australia imports motor vehicles, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW" rel="nofollow">
          BMW
         </a>
         s and Toyota cars. Total trade between the two countries has been growing at over 10 per cent a year over the past five years. Economic growth has been rapid, with annual growth of six per cent, but unemployment remains very high, with rates of over 25 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         In many ways, post-apartheid South Africa has been a success. The two dark spots on the record are the alarming rates of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
          HIV
         </a>
         -
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
          AIDS
         </a>
         and the very high rates of violent crime. Both have the potential to impede economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the field of government, the parliament and the executive are dominated by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" rel="nofollow">
          African National Congress
         </a>
         . The delegation met with members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African" rel="nofollow">
          South African
         </a>
         Parliament, including the Deputy Speaker, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANC" rel="nofollow">
          ANC
         </a>
         Deputy Chief Whip, the Committee of Foreign Affairs Deputy Chair, the Trade and Industry Committee Chair, Douglas Gibson, the Chief Opposition Whip and other opposition members and Ms P Hollander, the Deputy Chair of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">
          National Council
         </a>
         of Provinces. The meetings were valuable in gaining an understanding of the South African system of government and the handling of current issues. The delegation made a visit to Robin Island, where
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" rel="nofollow">
          Nelson Mandela
         </a>
         was held for most of his 27 years of imprisonment. It was a very moving experience, as our guide had been a former political prisoner on the island himself.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also visited the Kalkfontein township on the outskirts of Capetown. We spoke with residents of the poor but tidy township and visited a day care centre and the newly constructed school, which is also used for a health care program run by medical students from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Stellenbosch" rel="nofollow">
          University of Stellenbosch
         </a>
         . We later met with students at the university campus. The delegation was greatly impressed by the program and has promised assistance on our return to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, the visit was of value to us all in giving us an appreciation of the challenges facing the people of South Africa, the influence of its recent history on its outlook in the region of southern Africa and the economic potential of the country.
