       <p>
        I have spoken out strongly against the Turnbull government's plan to annihilate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
         ARENA
        </a>
        , the Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Energy" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Agency. This was a very important issue in my electorate. I am delighted that, through the strong advocacy of Labor, we have saved ARENA and secured some $800 million in funding for that agency over the next five years. ARENA has very clearly stated that this level of funding will now allow it to continue a strong work program, and for that Labor are very pleased.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is, sadly, the third time that this government has tried to destroy the renewable energy sector in Australia. I am proud to say it is the third time Labor has prevented it. First, this government tried to destroy the renewable energy target, but Labor was able to save it. Then the government tried to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and again Labor was able to save it. This is now the third occasion on which the Australian renewable energy sector has been saved from this government by Labor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, this package of funding will develop much-needed certainty to the renewable energy sector, a sector crying out for that certainty. Under Labor, there was certainty and there was a clear vision for renewables. As a result of that, Australia had become the fourth most attractive destination for renewable investment and we saw a massive boost across the country in jobs in the renewables industry. By contrast, under the Abbott-Turnbull government, there has been a massive drop in renewables investment. This has come at a time when the world's level of investment in renewables dramatically increased. Rather than having to operate under the constant threat of annihilation, this agreement—the agreement struck between Labor and the government—secures ARENA's future for the next five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dealing with the threat of climate change requires fundamental and long-term changes to our economy. Labor took a comprehensive set of climate change policies to the 2016 election, which would have achieved that fundamental change without leaving any individual or community behind. Labor have led the way on promoting renewable energy in Australia, and we remain committed to achieving the energy transition as soon as possible and practicable. That is why we have also secured a commitment from the government to come to the table and explore options for the acceleration of the clean energy transition Australia desperately needs. We cannot stand back and wait another three years to push this transition. We in Labor believe we have a responsibility to ensure that the renewable energy sector is in a healthy position when Labor reclaim government.
       </p>
       <p>
        This agreement is just the first step. We will face a government that has a history of undermining renewables and listening to climate change deniers. Just as Labor have fought to save ARENA, we will continue to fight for real action on climate change and a clean energy future for Australia.
