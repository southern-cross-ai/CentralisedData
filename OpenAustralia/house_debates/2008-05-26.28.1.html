        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to his failure to answer the previous question and I put this question: is the Prime Minister aware of evidence that independent fuel retailers had been disadvantaged by the FuelWatch scheme in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , which had led to a decrease in their numbers and consequently a decline in competition?

         I am sure that, on matters as contentious as fuel policy in general and on the introduction of FuelWatch in particular, you are going to have a range of opinions and advice rolling around the country at any given time, within government and outside of government. That is the nature of public policy. The key thing is that when this matter was subjected to analysis by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         , the conclusion was clear that this particular proposal of the government was worthy of implementation. It provides consumers with choice, as described recently by the Assistant Treasurer. We believe therefore it is an appropriate course of action consistent with what the Liberal government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         and the Liberal leadership of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         have had to say. As I said, policy is contestable and people have different points of view—I understand that—but we think that this is the right way to go. It is certainly worth providing consumers with this opportunity for choice.
