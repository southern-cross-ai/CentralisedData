        I rise to pay tribute to a true gentleman and pillar of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Limestone Coast
        </a>
        community, Mr Brian Page. Brian was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        through and through. His breadth of knowledge of all things south-east is probably unmatched. Brian was a forestry professional and founding member of the Mount Gambier Hoo-Hoo branch, the Fraternal Order of the Forest Products Industry, serving as president in 1978; a member of the Mount Gambier Club; a member of the Limestone Coast Area Consultative Committee since its inception in 1995; and a member of the Australian Institute of Wood Science. He worked tirelessly for the local tourism industry, including serving on the Riddoch Art Gallery Foundation as one of the original trustees, chairman of the Limestone Coast Tourism Board and the committee chairman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Nelson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        establishment body.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Brian was probably perhaps best known for his philanthropy. Brian was a member of the Stand Like Stone Foundation board of directors since its inception in 2004 and was the inaugural chair of the interim steering committee for the community foundation project. Brian and his wife Sue were also founding donors and, through Stand Like Stone, established scholarships for students at Mount Gambier High School, Kingston Community School and Keith Area School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brian's belief of community-based philanthropy has served our community in the Limestone Coast well. Brian joined myself and many others in pushing for the federal government to reform tax deductible gift recipient rules, as Brian believed strongly, as I do, in the community foundation model and the premise that locally collected charitable donations were best spent on the local communities and that a long-term sustainable approach to giving was the only way to combat long-term entrenched community problems. Brian worked tirelessly for a more generous and inclusive community. He did it quietly, without seeking personal accolade. Brian's generosity, his kindness, his knowledge and his love for the south-east are what he will be fondly remembered for by many.
       </p>

        and, indeed, the wider south-east have lost a great man but have benefited immensely from his lifelong commitment and dedication to community throughout his life. As we reflect on Brian's life, let us be inspired to be more like him, if only in part, and give back to the community that supports so many. My sincerest condolences to Brian's wife Sue, his extended family and his many friends. Vale Brian Page.
