        . Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison and

        government is keeping Australians safe by taking positive action to combat organised crime gangs and improve security at our airports and seaports? Is the minister aware of any policy standing in the way of keeping Australians safe?

         I thank the member for his question. He knows, as I'm sure everyone in this place knows, that serious crime is a major threat to our way of life. It costs Australia more than $47 billion a year, and, sadly, the impacts are much greater in terms of the human suffering in our families and in our communities. Last week there was a serious blow delivered to organised crime and criminal gangs in this country through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ironside" rel="nofollow">
          Operation Ironside
         </a>
         . The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , working hand in glove with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" rel="nofollow">
          FBI
         </a>
         , were pivotal in bringing down a series of international criminal networks, including criminal gangs here in Australia. The results have been absolutely outstanding. So far there have been 268 offenders charged, with 627 offences. Nearly four tonnes of drugs have been seized, and just over $51 million in cash has been confiscated.
        </p>
        <p>
         All Australians should be so proud of the work of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         , the Australian Federal Police. They are a smart, dedicated, committed workforce, and they have worked tirelessly to make our community so much safer. They said that critical to this operation was the legislation that was passed in 2018. Our government is absolutely committed to ensuring that our law enforcement agencies and our national security agencies have the legislative backing that they need, which is why today we have brought on in the Senate our transport security legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill will disrupt criminal activity at the wharfs and at the airports. Most Australians would be very shocked to know that there are more than 220 people working in the most secure areas of our airports and wharfs who are on either the National Criminal Target List or the national gangs list. We want to close the loophole to ensure tighter security checks and eligibility for those in trusted positions in our airports and on our wharves. I ask those opposite to pass the legislation that is needed now, the legislation that we have tried to pass through three successive parliaments. We ask those opposite to pass this legislation to support the work that the coalition is doing to make our wharves and our airports more secure. There is no more time that we can wait. This legislation needs to be passed now. I ask those opposite to take a strong interest in national security and to pass the legislation.
