       <p>
        I rise today to talk about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Chisholm" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Chisholm
        </a>
        . The electorate of Chisholm, which I now proudly serve as a member of this House, was named after Caroline Chisholm. The electorate was created in 1949, the same year my father migrated to Australia. I've always thought it particularly fitting that Chisholm was named after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Chisolm" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Chisolm
        </a>
        , as she was a strong advocate for migration and she helped women, and Chisholm is one of the most culturally diverse electorates in Australia. Over 100 languages other than English are spoken there every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I refer to a newly released biography of Caroline Chisolm. The subtitle aptly describes Caroline Chisholm as an irresistible force. I'm delighted that the author of this book, Sarah Goldman, is in the House today, because this is indeed an irresistible read. It encompasses a granular analysis of this amazing woman who helped shape our nation. Caroline Chisolm was indeed a feminist, described as a 'protofeminist', and had an instilled belief in diversity, inclusiveness and multiculturalism before her time. To quote from this book: 'Caroline Chisholm knew that a truly hardworking, eclectic community would eventually produce a proud, successful society full of heart and soul.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sure that if Caroline Chisholm were alive today she would walk around Chisholm and be truly proud that my electorate was named in her honour. The people of Chisholm have together created an electorate that is a microcosm of Australia, the most successful multicultural nation on earth.
