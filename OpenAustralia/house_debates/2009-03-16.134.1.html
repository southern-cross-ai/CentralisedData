       <p>
        I wish to pay tribute to the late Mavis Shelton. Mavis, a wonderful woman and local identity in the Lindsay electorate, passed away on 25 January this year, aged 77.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not one for extravagance, Mavis was a hardworking and no-nonsense person who was devoted to her family, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Bulldogs" rel="nofollow">
         Canterbury Bulldogs
        </a>
        . Losing her husband over half a century ago, Mavis was left to raise her two children single-handedly. Her family has since grown, and she is survived by her children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        A no-frills person, Mavis had a strong sense of social justice and an unwavering commitment to the principles of the Labor movement. Mavis was a long-time member and stalwart of the Labor Party, who handed out flyers and volunteered in campaign after campaign. Those of us in the local area who have run for public office owe a great debt of gratitude to Mavis for her dedication, for her tireless work and for her friendship.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a former dressmaker, Mavis also had an immense talent for crocheting and knitting and, with seven grandchildren, she had an output that was prolific to match. Each of my four children were beneficiaries of her needlework, wearing some of the finest baby clothing I have seen. Mavis will be fondly remembered as a woman dedicated to the things she believed in, and I know she is sorely missed.
