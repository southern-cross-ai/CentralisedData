        Last month I was privileged to attend the foster carers picnic day at Camp Toukley. The day was hosted by the

        </a>
        out-of-home care interagency network, which represent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        foster care and adoption services. The day was to acknowledge and celebrate the valuable work of foster carers across the Central Coast. Currently on the Central Coast there are around 82,000 children between zero and 19 years of age. Community Services have 15,000 child protection reports pertaining to these children, and over 4,000 children have been identified as being at significant risk of harm. The day provided much-deserved respite to the carers and the children, with a barbecue hosted by North Lakes Toukley Rotary and plenty of fun activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the day, I met with foster carers and children who shared their personal stories with me. The commitment of the carers to provide the children with a stable, secure and loving environment has a monumental impact on the lives of many children. I witnessed the interaction of many children in care with their foster carers, and the bond between them was so strong. In fact, there was no way of identifying who was a foster child and who was a natural child of the carer. All were relaxed and having fun.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was extremely touched by the dedication of one particular carer, a lady in her 70s caring for a young baby. This beautiful baby looked so peaceful in her stroller, but unfortunately her future does not look bright. She was born to a drug-addicted mother, and this beautiful baby girl has severe brain damage and will not, unfortunately, live a fulfilled, healthy life. Without foster carers to protect and look after vulnerable children in our community, children such as this beautiful baby would never experience the love and security afforded by a caring family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Erin Fidgeon is a 19-year-old and was in foster care for eight years, and I was fortunate to meet Erin and her foster mum, Vicki. Erin is a positive young woman who has not let her early life experiences hold her back. In Erin's own words, when she first entered foster care she was 'a very agitated, angry and hurt child'. It was through the help of her carers that she was given the strength and determination to achieve great things. Erin reflected that having consistency, boundaries and a safe, loving environment are crucial to experiencing the positive changes of being in foster care.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I met with Erin, besides being impressed by her positivity, I was informed of some of her achievements. She was vice captain at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbi_Umbi" rel="nofollow">
         Tumbi Umbi
        </a>
        campus of Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College, she was runner-up in the TVET School Student of the Year and nominated for the Marie Bashir Award. Erin is now studying to work in the childcare profession. Erin's initial lack of self-confidence when she first entered care is in stark contrast to the confident young woman that I met.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all the foster carers in our community, I sincerely thank you for the dedication and sacrifices that many of you make to provide a safe, nurturing environment for our most vulnerable children. To each and every one of you: I thank you.
