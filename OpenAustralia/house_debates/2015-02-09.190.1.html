        Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the call, because I really want to acknowledge Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Baird" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Baird
        </a>
        , who was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        . He has made enormous contributions to the Hunter community. Alan held executive positions—including club president, club secretary and public officer—of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warners_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Warners Bay
        </a>
        from 1978 to 2010. He was instrumental in kicking off the first Loop the Lake bike ride for charity in 1997, and that has become an annual event that raises thousands of dollars for charity. Alan Baird has been a fantastic member of our local community, and I really want to pay tribute to him.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to paying tribute to Alan Baird, I want to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Burgess" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Burgess
        </a>
        , who lives in Newcastle and whom I have worked very closely with. He was responsible for the DALE program, which works with young mums who have babies. We did a lot of work together when we had the Brighter Futures program, and he really is committed to young people, to ensuring that they have a second chance in life and to providing the support that they need to be able to continue with their education and then have a future.
       </p>
       <p>
        So these are two people that have really made enormous contributions to Australia, and their recognition is—
