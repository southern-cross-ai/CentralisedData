         Thomas Mayo
        </a>
        has demonstrated enormous conviction, energy and stamina in his commitment to the vital cause of reconciliation. He has devoted himself to making the case for constitutional recognition of First Nations Australians through a voice to parliament, and he is literally crisscrossing this incredible continent, week after week, talking with anyone and everyone about that cause. His book
        <i>
         Finding the Heart of a Nation
        </i>
        tells the story of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which was the culmination of a representative process that has been part of the most extensive preparation for a referendum that Australia has ever seen. Not long ago, Thomas Mayo attended an event at the Beeliar Wetlands Centre, in my electorate, to speak with people who want to see our nation take a long-awaited step in the direction of recognition, consultation and fairness. On that day, he was characteristically generous and characteristically his gentle-natured self. He recited the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which he knows by heart. He spoke from his fundamental core of goodwill and reason to make the point that better decision-making through consultation is in the best interests of all Australians. Thomas Mayo is a remarkable Australian of courage and has faith in our values and our democratic processes. He's doing a fantastic job of explaining how we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by walking together on the path to fairness and reconciliation by creating a voice to parliament.
