       <p>
        (esterday marked 10 years since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States of America. Even 10 years on, the events of that day are difficult to comprehend. The death and destruction caused by those acts of premeditated terror must always be remembered for what they were—horrific crimes committed against innocent people. We must remember the victims and the loved ones left behind.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should also remember the extraordinary courage of the police officers, fire fighters and other emergency responders who risked, and in many cases gave, their lives to rescue others. The memory of those who lost their lives and the pain of their families strengthens our resolve to protect our communities from terrorism and to stop the spread of ideologies of hate and violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Remembering the victims of terrorism
       </p>
       <p>
        The 10th anniversary of September 11 is a time for our nation to remember not only the victims of those attacks but also the victims of terrorism around the world since then. Sadly, we have seen terrible events in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        , Africa, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, the United Kingdom, Spain and many other parts of the world. The recent July 2011 attack in Norway reminds us that terrorism is an international crime and that no country is immune from this threat. Indeed, Australians have been directly affected by terrorism and violent extremism over the past decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2001, more than 110 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks overseas, including 88 people in the first Bali bombings of 2002. In pausing to reflect on the decade that has passed, we remember these Australians who lost their lives in these senseless acts of violence. We must honour these Australians by learning the lessons from the attacks that caused their untimely deaths, so we can reduce the risk of further attacks, both within Australia and overseas.
       </p>

        Australia’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
         National Security
        </a>
        — a decade after September 11 2001
       </p>
       <p>
        The September 11 attacks on the United States changed the global security environment probably forever. While terrorism continues to threaten peace and security, Australia is better equipped to deal with it now than we were a decade ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government’s highest priority must always be to protect the safety and security of its citizens. In partnership with our international friends and allies, we have acted decisively to strengthen our national security and reduce the risk of terrorism and extremist violence. We have done this by identifying and addressing our vulnerabilities, and creating effective layers of security both domestically and globally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since September 11, spending on national security has increased significantly in response to this challenge. Investment in national security (including defence) has increased from approximately $18 billion in 2001-02 to over $33 billion in 2011-12, around $7 billion of that on domestic security matters. The government has adopted a comprehensive, holistic counter-terrorism strategy which is essential to these efforts. We have enhanced intelligence, investigative and law enforcement capabilities. We are building strategic partnerships with businesses and the broader community to protect critical infrastructure, including technological and cybersecurity.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are ensuring we have strong laws to deal with those who prepare for or carry out acts of terrorism. We are continually improving international legal cooperation and intelligence sharing in relation to counter-terrorism. And we are strengthening preventive measures to counter violent extremism before it takes seed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Intelligence
       </p>
       <p>
        Effective intelligence, information sharing and law enforcement are essential in the effort to defeat terrorists. Domestically and overseas our intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies have worked together tirelessly to detect and disrupt threats to our national security. This collaboration, perseverance and vigilance have averted tragedy on our own shores.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2000, four major terrorist plots have been disrupted in Australia. To date, 38 individuals have been prosecuted as a result of counter-terrorism operations and, while some matters are still before the courts, 22 have been convicted. One can only imagine what might have happened if the plans of these individuals had been successfully carried out, not only in personal injury, death and destruction to property but also the damage that it would have done to our vibrant multicultural community and culture of tolerance. Our response to the threat of terrorism involves every level of government. This approach reflects the shared understanding of all levels of government that national security is not simply a Commonwealth policy issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Countering violent extremism and building resilience
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government, like its counterparts in the United States and United Kingdom, understands that addressing the causes of radicalisation that lead to violent extremism is crucial to tackling terrorism in the future. Immediately after the September 11 attacks there was much focus on international law enforcement, tough terrorism laws, and physical security measures, all of which have delivered results through the detection and deterrence of terrorist activity. What was less appreciated was that a strong counterterrorism response is needed, and that strong counterterrorism response requires strategies to lessen the appeal of extremist ideologies that fuel terrorism in the first place.
       </p>
       <p>
        While terrorism seeks to divide and destroy by raising fear, it fails when communities work together to build upon and adhere to our shared principles and values, and remain united and resilient in partnership. Security experts warn that the greatest threat to Australia is, in fact, home-grown extremism. Agencies like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        do an excellent job in helping to keep Australia safe. But they can't do it alone. The government's Countering Violent Extremism program works with these agencies and local communities to prevent radicalisation of those in Australia who are targeted by extremist messages.
       </p>
       <p>
        All community leaders have a responsibility to assist in building our tolerant and inclusive society that is itself a powerful tool against the emergence of extremism. Communities have many roles to play, including identifying and supporting vulnerable individuals who may choose a path away from violence, and developing localised solutions to address vulnerabilities and grievances, and the government expresses its appreciation for the support it has received from relevant communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Laws and enforcement
       </p>
       <p>
        September 11 showed us we must be prepared to identify and combat threats to our national security that are within and extend between nations, economies, businesses, communities and individuals. We need to continually examine, review and calibrate our laws and practices to ensure we properly equip our security and intelligence agencies and that we focus their efforts appropriately to meet the challenges and threats within Australia and also internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2010 and 2011 the government amended national security legislation to ensure that our law enforcement and security agencies have the tools that they need to fight terrorism, while ensuring the laws and powers are balanced by appropriate safeguards and accountability measures. These amendments were also designed to ensure these agencies are better able to assist each other and share information and to have secondment between agencies of relevant officers and employees—while at the same time maintaining the principle of privacy and respect for personal liberty.
       </p>
       <p>
        The appointment of an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Mr Bret Walker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC" rel="nofollow">
         SC
        </a>
        , reflects the Australian government’s commitment to ensuring our national security and counterterrorism laws provide a balanced and proportionate response to the threat of terrorism. And because we live in a highly globalised environment which makes it easier for malicious actors to operate from overseas, the government is strongly focused on enhancing international legal and law enforcement cooperation—so laws designed to counter terrorism are connected and harmonised between nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        While the attacks of September 11 2001 killed thousands, the decade that has followed shows us that terrorism has not and cannot undermine our way of life. Osama bin Laden’s death was an important milestone in the international fight against anti-Western, transnational terrorism, and a blow to the morale of al-Qaeda and those it inspires. But as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        reminded us:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … his death does not mark the end of our effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding today, let me say that terrorists can kill, maim and destroy property, but no-one can weaken our values of humanity and freedom, or our belief in democracy and the rule of law, and this is unquestionably the greatest weapon we have against terrorism.

        <p>
         I thank the Attorney for his statement. Today being the 10th anniversary of the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, it is very appropriate that the parliament mark and acknowledge the event, as we did at the start of question time today. On this anniversary it is particularly appropriate that we remember the thousands of innocent people killed and their loved ones who are left behind. We should particularly remember the Australians who were amongst those killed in this tragedy. We should also remember the incredible courage of those police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel who risked—and in some cases lost—their lives trying to rescue others. The coalition joins with the government in asserting that the memory of those who lost their lives only strengthens our resolve to protect Australians from terrorist attack and to stop the spread of ideologies of violence and hate which breed such attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
         As was noted by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
          President Obama
         </a>
         of the United States in his letter to the Prime Minister today, former coalition
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister John Howard
         </a>
         was in Washington when the terrorists struck the US on September 11. From that time, the former coalition government provided over $10.4 billion of funding up to the 2010-11 year to enhance Australia's national security and counterterrorism capabilities by: increasing the capacity of our intelligence agencies; boosting Australia's aviation, maritime and border security; and enhancing our capacity to respond to and manage emergencies. In government, the coalition increased regional and global cooperation in law enforcement, customs activities and legal assistance to boost the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. The fact that there have been no terrorist attacks on Australian soil and few involving Australians abroad testifies to our substantial success.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this vital area, it is important that the Gillard government continue to build on the good work of its predecessor. Keeping the Australian people safe is the most basic task of government. It was my great privilege to be a member of a coalition government which left Australia economically, militarily and diplomatically stronger than it had ever been. The coalition agrees that antiterrorism intelligence operations are indeed a vitally important element of our national security infrastructure. Thanks to the hardworking men and women of our law enforcement and security agencies, Australia's counterterrorism capability is extensive and the public can be confident that any terrorism incident can be responded to and dealt with effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the 10th anniversary of September 11, we reflect on the thousands of lives that were lost. As former Prime Minister John Howard said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Terrorists oppose nations such as the United States and Australia not because of what we have done but because of who we are and because of the values that we hold in common.
        </p>
        <p>
         These values of freedom and democracy are values that are worth fighting to protect. Mr Howard's trip to Washington on 11 September 2001 had been timed to mark the 50th anniversary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         military alliance which commits Australia,

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS Treaty
         </a>
         following the 11 September attacks was a testament to the closeness of the relationship between the United States and Australia. The coalition strongly believes that the ANZUS Treaty is of fundamental importance to both our countries, and the goodwill and mutual support implicit within it should never be taken for granted.

          Abraham Lincoln

          Civil War
         </a>
         . President Bush, who was president on 11 September, said Abraham Lincoln 'understood the cost of sacrifice, and reached out to console those in sorrow as best he could'. In a November 1860 letter to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Bixby" rel="nofollow">
          Lydia Bixby
         </a>
         , Lincoln wrote in one passage quoted by Bush:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I pray that our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Father" rel="nofollow">
          Heavenly Father
         </a>
         may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
         The remark follows another moving passage Lincoln wrote:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the surviving members of the families of the victims of 9-11 these are moving words, particularly so for the literally hundreds of firefighters and police who died running into the burning twin towers that day.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that we remember that no terrorist act large or small will weaken our commitment to democracy and freedom. Nobody should underestimate how much the world has changed since 11 September 2001. However, it is vital on this anniversary that we reaffirm and remind ourselves that the terrorists have not and will not succeed in their goals. We have faced their challenge head on and we continue to prevail. On this anniversary I thank all the hardworking men and women of the Australian security, intelligence and military agencies who have protected our freedom since that day.
