       <p>
        Secure housing is a basic right. It changes lives. It is the foundation on which we each build a career, raise a family and plan for the future. To the single mum couch surfing with her children, to the young woman fleeing domestic violence and to the homeless veteran sleeping rough: I stand with you. The Albanese government stands with you. We understand that you are hurting and that the housing crisis is biting. That's why before the last federal election we, the Labor Party, announced a comprehensive housing package. Central to this package was the Housing Australia Future Fund, a $10 billion program to build 30,000 homes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now we are in government and it is time to act, but what is deeply disappointing is that the Greens and the coalition are teaming up to stand in the way of providing secure housing, a safe place to call home, for our most vulnerable Australians. I truly do not understand why the Greens and the coalition would do this. It makes absolutely no sense. It's all about politics and nothing to do with the people we are here to serve. So I'm proud that, in the face of such blind opposition, on Saturday our Prime Minister and our Minister for Housing announced an additional $2 billion for a social housing accelerator program, which will be provided to the states and territories in the next two weeks, to urgently address our desperate need for more housing. My state, Victoria, will receive close to $500 million to refurbish housing stock, placing greater emphasis on planning reforms that will improve housing availability in our urban and regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is only this government, a Labor government, that understands the urgency of this issue and wants to deal with it right now. The coalition's and Greens' delaying tactic of deferring the bill in the Senate is an absolute disgrace. It means that people in need are going to have to wait three more months before a decision may be made to enable the construction of these homes. As the Prime Minister said earlier today, this bill has resounding support outside of this place from the Community Housing Industry Association, Master Builders Australia and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Housing Association. These organisations understand, as we do, that each day this bill is not rolled out our building industry and its workers miss out, and each day $1.3 million is not going towards homes for those who need them most.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill is vital. It's time to stop playing politics, because right now there are over 116,000 people experiencing homelessness. Their lives are marred by uncertainty and insecurity. We—all members in this place—have a duty to answer their call, to ease suffering and restore faith in a country and a government that cares for its most vulnerable. Each day the Greens and the coalition delay, another family slips through the cracks, another child worries where they're going to sleep at night, and another person loses hope.
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of people experiencing homelessness has increased by 14 per cent in the past five years alone.

        </a>
        are disproportionately affected, comprising a staggering 30 per cent of homelessness across our nation. And let us not forget our veterans, who have bravely served our country only to find themselves facing the harsh reality of homelessness upon their return. These are not just numbers. They represent the faces and stories of our fellow Australians. They are our neighbours, our friends, our families and our community members, and it is our collective responsibility to provide them with the stability and security they deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government understands this, and our record on housing policy shows we are determined to address the housing crisis right here and right now. We have consistently expanded our comprehensive housing agenda, leaving no stone unturned. We've introduced: the National Housing Accord; the biggest increase to Commonwealth Rent Assistance in 30 years; reforms to facilitate build-to-rent projects; the expansion of the First Home Guarantee, Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee and an increase of the liability cap of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation; and extra funding to the states and territories, through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, to help tackle homelessness.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        pointed out in question time today, the government has also committed an additional $100 million to continue the Safe Places Emergency Accommodation Program. This program is recognition that family and domestic violence is the main reason women and children leave their homes in Australia, and it is the leading cause of homelessness for women. Access to safe accommodation is fundamental to the immediate safety of women and children. This is all important and vital work, but we must take the next step and see the Housing Australia Future Fund passed in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing,
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        will record for all time that, when the Greens were given the opportunity to vote for a bill that gives people more secure housing, they voted against it, as did the coalition, and turned their backs on our most vulnerable Australians. I urge the Greens and the coalition to rise above partisan politics and vote instead with compassion and generosity for more housing. Do the right thing and be remembered not for creating barriers but for embracing and voting for reform—reform that acts on the housing crisis and uplifts the lives of our fellow Australians. This parliament has an opportunity with the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill to redefine the narrative of our nation, to show that we in parliament value compassion, solidarity and the fundamental right to safe and affordable housing. Let history remember the Housing Australia Future Fund as the turning point, the moment all sides in this house stood united and declared that no-one should be left behind. I implore you to find the courage and the resolve to make a difference to the lives of those who need it most.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the words of former Prime Minister Paul Keating:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are no better measures real or symbolic of how well we are succeeding as a nation and as a society than the quality of our housing …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Look and you will see stark evidence of the fact that poor quality housing and poor urban environments mean greatly reduced opportunities …
       </p>
       <p>
        With that, I say to the Greens and the coalition: don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Instead, stand with us and address Australia's housing crisis right here and right now.
