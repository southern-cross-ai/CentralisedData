         I thank the member for Kennedy for his question asked with characteristic elan. I will say this: in just that question, he has asked 50 per cent of the questions that the entire Labor Party has asked about the environment in the last two years, and that one question was twice as good.
        </p>
        <p>
         Firstly, I join with him in being delighted at the fact that a reef that we inherited on the path to being listed as in danger is off that track and is now being proclaimed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         . Secondly, in relation to his three projects, there are probably three things that we are doing that can help. But I will say this: all of this is being done as we prepare very shortly for a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         white paper which will open up the great north to immense opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The three things we are doing at these. Firstly, we are removing barriers to new projects. To the best of my knowledge, none of those three projects are currently seeking federal environmental approval; but, if they do, they will be subject to a one-stop shop which has seen us clear $1 trillion of backlogged approvals under a process which they proposed in government and opposed in opposition.

              I withdraw. Not only is there the one-stop shop. Beyond that, we are also providing incentives for emissions reduction. The first Emissions Reduction Fund auction: 47 million tonnes—in Queensland, 19 projects. I believe, from what I have heard, that these projects may well comply under the transport methodology. So there is another opportunity—barriers gone, incentives in place and, thirdly, we can provide incentives for new workforce development. And we can do that by giving young people training through the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
               Green Army
              </a>
              . Already 300 projects have commenced, even though we said it would be only 250 this year. In your electorate, I think the figure is: 24 projects have been announced and a number of those have commenced. So we are removing barriers. We are providing incentives and we are allowing new people to enter the workforce, so we can help if you have a project that you want to bring forward.
