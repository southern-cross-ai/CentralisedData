        It was not that long ago that physical activity and exercise were something no Australian lived without. We were outdoor people. We spoke to our neighbours across the fence while our children played cricket on the street and climbed trees. We went to parks or beaches on the weekend, a great way of getting out of the house without spending any money. But since the rise of technology and longer working hours, our lives have become a lot more sedentary.

        I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Foundation" rel="nofollow">

        event yesterday with Assistant Minister for Health Fiona Nash. The theme for the day was 'move more, sit less'. It noted that adults who sit less during the day lower their risk of an early death. So 'move more, sit less' is an important theme as it encourages us to think about how we actually spend our days. We can all do simple things to increase our physical activity, like taking the stairs instead of the lift.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two out of three adults and one in four children in Australia are either overweight or obese. It is estimated that physical inactivity costs our health system about $1.5 billion in avoidable costs. According to the Australian Health Survey, only one in three children and one in 10 young people do the 60 minutes of physical activity a day that is recommended.

        The coalition government has a strong plan to get our young people involved in sport as a step towards a healthier future. Yesterday, Minister for Sport the Hon.

        launched Play Sport Australia, the government's new scheme for improving participation in organised sport. The national strategy focuses on three key areas: better research, better targeting of investment in youth programs, and strengthening Australia's national sporting organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, only a quarter of Australians play sport. With 13,000 deaths every year in Australia attributed to physical inactivity, we need to boost participation. In conjunction with Play Sport Australia, the Minister for Sport also announced the Sporting Schools program, the coalition government's $100 million junior participation program for children aged five to 12. This will give Australian children access to sport before, during and after school hours. There are 32 programs developed by national sporting organisations. The program also links schools to local sporting clubsâ€”another benefit for the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sport is good not only for physical health but also for mental wellbeing. Encouraging young children to get involved in sport not only sets them up for a healthy life but also teaches them social skills and how to be a team player. These days, with such an increased prevalence of technology, our young people risk missing out on the core values learned by being part of a team and by playing sport. That is why the coalition government is committed to ensuring that all children have more access and encouragement to play sport. This weekend I will be at The Gap Little Athletics, and I thank all the many volunteers who contribute to our children playing sport.
