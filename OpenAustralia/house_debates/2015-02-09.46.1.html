         Australia Day
        </a>
        is our time to meet friends and family and share the joy of living in this great country. In Gilmore neighbourhood parks were quiet and still yet on any grassy area near water—a river, creek, dam or beach—was a gathering of Aussies enjoying the day. Three local residents had even more to celebrate. They were awarded the Order of Australia medal. It is an honour to share some of their stories to recognise their achievements.

         OAM
        </a>
        has been an amazing advocate for decades. She is a co-founder of the Nowra Sub-branch of Partners of Veterans Association of Australia. At functions she hands out individually handmade gifts. She is a shining light. Harry Gooden OAM is a servant of the community on so many different levels it will be impossible to cover them all. The contribution he has made to Australia is truly invaluable, often liaising with local and state governments for the community. Robert Carroll OAM contributes to Australia for effective social improvement. Some of his work and voluntary engagement includes working as a psychology officer at the state Army cadet brigade, an Army reservist, a drug and alcohol counsellor and a volunteer for the

        Illawarra communications brigade, among many other community activities.

        It is truly inspirational to see these people dedicate so much of their life not only to our local organisations but to the wider Australian community. Their achievements and service encourage and inspire others to volunteer and become part of this action to assist our community overall. Well done to all those honoured on Australia Day 2015.
