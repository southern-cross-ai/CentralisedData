       Bradfield Electorate: Turramurra Post Office

      <p class="italic">
       Dear Mr Murphy
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 16 March 2011, concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding the Turramurra Post Office.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the
       <i>
        Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989
       </i>
       Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The government believes the decision to close a post office should not be made lightly, that commercial considerations should be weighed alongside community expectations, and that communities should be consulted and engaged before a final decision is made. It is on this basis that the government is working with Australia Post to strengthen the protocols and transparency around the decision making process for the closure of outlets.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       In meeting the needs of the community Australia Post occasionally converts or closes a post office that is no longer sustainable for a variety of reasons, including changes to a lease or declining customer numbers and profitability levels. There may also be the need to open a new post office where a new suburb is developing or where there is increased demand. In assessing any closure, Australia Post has an internal review mechanism that looks at all factors including customer usage, proximity to other outlets and overall cost.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Turramurra Post Office has operated at a loss of $350 000 over the last three years. Following the cessation of counter services at Turramurra Post Office on 28 January 2011, a range of postal product and services became available at a newly established PostPoint at Blockbuster Video at 8 Eastern Road, Turramurra.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that the PostPoint has now been upgraded to a Community Postal Agency which offers additional services of weighing and assessment of postage, mail lodgement facilities and bill payments by cheque. Post office boxes have been retained at the former post office location pending identification of a more permanent site. One of the existing red street posting boxes located near this outlet will be upgraded to an Express Post box. The local community is served by three post offices within a 2.5 kilometre radius at Turramurra North Post Office, Wahroonga Post Office and Pymble Post Office.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
