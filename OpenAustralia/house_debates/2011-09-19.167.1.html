       <p>
        I am not given to speaking that much about other politicians, let alone those who are technically political opponents; however, I will make an exception when it comes to Councillor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lake" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Lake
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbelltown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Campbelltown City Council
        </a>
        . Tomorrow Councillor Lake will stand down as mayor, and I think it is appropriate to record some of my thoughts about him and his commitment to the community. Paul was first elected to council in 2004 bringing with him a genuine community service background particularly in relation to junior sport. For the past 27 years Paul Lake has been a dedicated volunteer to junior rugby league, assisting children and their families within the community. In 1989 he was instrumental in forming the Western Suburbs Junior Rugby League Limited and was subsequently appointed chairman of the board, a position he held until 1999. His achievements and commitment to sport and the youth of the area were recognised in 1996 when he was awarded life membership of the junior rugby league.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to his council commitments Paul still turns up on weekends to assist those volunteers without whose effort local sport, particularly sport in relation to young people, would simply not take place. Paul Lake is a genuine friend to junior sport and to all those who work so hard to make it happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twelve months ago as a result of a cross-party agreement Paul was elected Mayor of Campbelltown. He brought to the position a genuine commitment of community service not simply as a means to a political end but as a reflection of his genuine commitment to the local families. I saw his tenacity on display in his pursuit of the new triathlon facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Fields" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Fields
        </a>
        . He lobbied hard and long and often I was the target of his efforts. It did not take long to realise that he is a man not interested in political games and who certainly can never be accused of putting politics ahead of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some time ago when I was the target of a concerted effort to remove me from my seat Paul Lake, as deputy mayor, took it upon himself to propose a council resolution with the view of achieving bipartisan support for my retention. Some would say that this was not politically smart on his part but for me it was deeply humbling that a person who I did not even vote for would take such an overt and courageous position on my behalf and particularly when there was no possible advantage in it for him.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not his actions in this regard that earned my admiration, as he had long impressed me with his very real commitment to the people of Campbelltown. Local government is vitally important given that it is the closest level of government to the people and that the issues related to the community are and must be paramount. Despite our political differences, from my observations Paul Lake has always acted in the best interest of his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul Lake is a good friend and I regard him as an excellent community representative. I take the opportunity to wish Anoulack Chanthivong who will succeed Paul Lake as mayor the very best in his term in that position. I know Anoulack very well and I am very confident that like his predecessor he will work hard to make a genuine difference for the better in his local community.
