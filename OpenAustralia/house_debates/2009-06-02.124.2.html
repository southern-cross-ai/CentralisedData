         <p>
          I come into this parliament to speak of my strong support for all the local and national initiatives that try to tackle global warming. I support all kinds of creative and innovative policies to tackle global emissions.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is important to also state that Australia’s emissions represent some 1.4 per cent of total global emissions. We acknowledge that, whilst this is a very significant national and global issue, it is also prudent and honest to say that our emissions, as part of the global total, are very small. China and India account for some 60 per cent of global emissions. We all know that the global emissions of the United States, the largest economy in the world, are enormous. So too are those for the developing economies of Brazil, India and Russia. What is important is global collaboration. It is important for the world to come together to tackle this important issue. That requires people of goodwill and intelligence to come together and work together. I stand in the queue with those who have put their hands up and said, ‘Let’s work together.’
         </p>
         <p>
          I also want to put on the record how important it is at the local level for all of us to do our little bit. That is why I have produced a very good brochure, if I do say so myself, called
          <i>
           Seven Green Ideas
          </i>
          , for people in the Ryan electorate to do their little bit
          <i>
           .
          </i>
          I know the people I represent are very conscious of making their contribution in their own way, whether it is taking shorter showers, walking to the local shops instead of riding in their car, using the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
           TV
          </a>
          a bit less or washing their clothes in cold water rather than in hot water. We also need to be careful with how we use air-conditioning. We all know that air-conditioning produces an enormous amount of emissions. We should also switch off appliances at the wall. Changing light bulbs is also important. It might seem like a small thing, but if we all do that then we will make a contribution.
         </p>
         <p>
          I, as the member for Ryan, as a local resident and as a citizen of this wonderful country of ours, make my contribution. I had solar panels installed on my roof a couple of years ago. Indeed, I ride a low-emission scooter in Ryan as part of my contribution. All of us can do our little bit to make the world a better place.
