       <p>
        I am very pleased today to speak about the Turnbull government's defence white paper released last week. With a record year for jobs last year and the unveiling of the northern Australia white paper, the agricultural competitiveness white paper and the defence white paper, this is just another feather in the cap of this government, which is developing long-term planning for Australians' future. Led by the Minister for Defence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne" rel="nofollow">
         Marise Payne
        </a>
        —and I would like to acknowledge that she is doing a terrific job in this very demanding role—the defence white paper is a blueprint to maintain Australia's great way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The white paper is a comprehensive, responsible, long-term vision for Australia's defence. This government is ensuring that we have the armed forces we need to protect Australia and to secure our regional interests in the coming decades and beyond. The plans in the document have been cost assured and externally validated. The government will increase defence spending to two per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        within a decade to keep Australia safe and secure—very responsible. This government investment in the ADF will be profound, with a continuous naval shipbuilding program commencing with nine Future Frigates and 12 offshore patrol vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Durack, record funding will be provided with the Royal Australian Air Force's Curtin air base in Derby and Learmonth air base in Exmouth to be upgraded, allowing these facilities to host the new F35A Lightning
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        -30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft. These upgrades will require investments of around $190 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Curtin by 2025 and around the same amount for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Learmonth" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Learmonth
        </a>
        in the same time frame. The Harold E Holt communication facility in Exmouth will also be upgraded to support enhanced space, situational awareness and communication capability, as will the Yampi Sound Training Area to the tune of $60 million, with a further $20 million refurbishment between 2025 and 2035.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is fantastic news for the communities of Derby and Exmouth, and the councils are understandably very pleased with the government's announcement of these investments. I would like to acknowledge the Shire of Derby President, Elsia Archer, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Stephen Gash, and also the Shire of Exmouth President, Turk Shales, and its CEO,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Price" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Price
        </a>
        , all of whom are working very hard in their respective regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will close by noting that Labor increased overall spending by over 50 per cent, to the tune of $147 billion, while last in office and left this government with a debt of around $310 billion, yet defence spending regrettably dropped to its lowest level since 1938. Thankfully, we are now on track. I commend the Turnbull government's defence white paper to the House.
