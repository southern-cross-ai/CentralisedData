       <p>
        I rise to commemorate the life of Thomas Edward Kelly, a dear friend, veteran, Labor stalwart and beloved Clayton icon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom was born on 25 February 1925. In 1943 at the age of 18, to the day, Tom joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        . During his service to the nation he served in many different places and stations, including Shepparton, Deniliquin, Townsville and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        . In 1976 Tom was discharged with the rank of leading aircraftman, having received a number of honours and awards. Like many who have served their country, Tom wore those metals with absolute pride.
       </p>
       <p>
        With his wife, Doris, he later settled in Clayton, where they raised their son. Tom was a proud father of one, grandfather of three and great-grandfather of six. Tom would often visit my office, and he when he was not telling jokes he was talking about his beloved wife, Doris, his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren. It was his family, despite all of the other things that he had done with his life, that were his greatest achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinary visit to my office would start with Tom pulling out his copy of 'In black and white' from the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald_Sun" rel="nofollow">
          Herald Sun
         </a>
        </i>
        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        and any funnies that he read along the way he would have carefully cut out to show us. I have to admit that they were not always the most humorous parts of the paper, but it was all in the delivery for Tom! He would tell us each and every joke, keeping a completely straight face until the very end, before he would end up with this roaring chuckle. He had a real knack for brightening the day for many of my staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom visited our office and, like many constituents, he would come in for assistance with federal matters. But, for us, it always felt like a friend popping in at home for a cuppa. Mind you, of course the cuppa would go hand in hand with a request for some assistance. One of the things that Tom would often ask us for was help in searching for commemorative coins for his grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom was a lot more than a friend to us in our office. He was also a dedicated member of the Labor Party and he spent many years assisting my predecessor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Crean
        </a>
        . I have no doubt that Simon's office enjoyed a joke or two with Tom along the way! Tom was also a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , and he became a financial member of the Clayton RSL all the way back in 1950. He proudly laid wreaths on my behalf on Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        every year, and did the same for my predecessor. Honestly, I could not think of a better representative; he served his country so proudly, and he was very proud of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know how much Tom would have enjoyed the opportunity to lay the wreath on the Centenary of Anzac this year and to have a drink with his mates afterwards. But, sadly, on 24 November, surrounded by his family, Tom passed away. I want to pay my respects to Tom's wife, Doris, and his family. Tom, we thank you for your dedication to our community, for brightening our day and for your service to our country. We miss you. Rest in peace.
