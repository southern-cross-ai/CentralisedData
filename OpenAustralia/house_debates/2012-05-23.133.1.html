       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the valuable contribution made by volunteers to the local community in my electorate of Newcastle. We all know that volunteers contribute over 700 million hours and $14.6 billion to the not-for-profit sector each year. These are remarkable statistics of commitment and of value and worth. It is always important, therefore, to take the time to recognise the importance of volunteering to our communities and to our Australian society.
       </p>
       <p>
        During
        <i>
         National Volunteer Week
        </i>
        last week, I had the great privilege and pleasure of attending volunteering ceremonies held by local organisations, in particular, the Northern Settlement Services Volunteers Appreciation Morning Tea and the Launch of the 2012 Red Shield Appeal, an appeal that depends on the committed work of many volunteers around the nation. At the Northern Settlements Services it was wonderful to see young African migrants, refugees, being assisted to attain studies and drivers licences, and gain computer skills. This is wonderful work that is helping people who come to this nation with a distinct disadvantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also the patron of the Hunter New England Mental Health Volunteer Service and I am very proud to be associated with the great work done by our local volunteers in that capacity. This organisation has around 80 volunteers across the Hunter-New England area who assist in improving the journey of recovery for those touched by mental illness in our community. While I was unable personally to attend the celebration morning tea during National Volunteer Week, my staff represented me at that event and reported that it was a great showcase of the wonderful things that our mental health volunteers are doing. So I give a big thank you all round.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since we were elected to government in 2007, federal Labor has provided over $425,000 under the FaHCSIA Volunteer Grants Program to over 31 local organisations in Newcastle. Although those grants are small they are very much welcomed by each organisation. This funding has helped to purchase much needed equipment for use by volunteers or to reimburse expenses incurred by volunteers who so generously donate their time to assisting others.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, $4,500 was provided to Grandparents as Parents, or GAPS, which is a fabulous group operating in my electorate. GAPS provides assistance and support for grandparents and other family members who act as carers for young relatives. The funding was directed to support GAPS in organising events and helping kinship carers to access welfare and advocacy services.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further $4,695 was granted to the Hunter African Communities Council to assist in providing a support network to migrants of Ethiopian descent who have settled in our city of Newcastle. From facilitating participation in local sporting and social activities to assisting residents to access support services, this is a volunteer organisation that is truly promoting social inclusion in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        While these funding commitments have had a significant impact and facilitate the wonderful work in our local community, it is also important to encourage and reward volunteering for the enrichment it provides to our social fabric. It is in pursuit of this goal that I recently called once more for nominations for the Newcastle Community Volunteer Awards. Held annually since 2004, those awards are a gesture of recognition and sincere thanks to ordinary people in my electorate who make extraordinary contributions in our community. As a testament to the strength of the volunteering community in Newcastle, I have proudly presented over 530 community volunteer awards to individuals and organisations from all sectors: from providers of aged care and disability services to those involved in education, sport and recreation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community in Newcastle is richer for the ongoing dedication, commitment and enthusiasm of our volunteers. I am always astounded by the stories behind each and every one of the recipients and also of the way everyone says, 'Oh no, I did not do anything.' Their modesty and humility are quite overwhelming.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the Hunter Volunteer Centre, currently under the guidance of manager
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Ross" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Ross
        </a>
        , in assisting to make the awards ceremony a success, year in and year out. This year the theme for the National Volunteers Weekwas 'Volunteersâ€”Every One Counts'. This is so true, and I know that all members in this House understand and appreciate the work of volunteers in their communities. They really do make a difference. They really are special.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to reading the stories that accompany the applications for the 2012 Newcastle Community Volunteer Awards as they start to flow in over the coming weeks. I take this opportunity to encourage anyone who knows of any Novocastrians who do volunteer to get into contact with my office for a nomination form. So do dob in a volunteer and help to recognise the work they selflessly do for others.
