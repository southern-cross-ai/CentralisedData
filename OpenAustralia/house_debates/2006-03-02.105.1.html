       <p>
        To some, 10 years is a long time. For me it has been truly an honour and a privilege to serve the community of Gilmore, and the time has just flown by. It seems like only yesterday that the people chose me to represent them in parliament, and I hope I have been worthy of their trust in me. Over time, a sense of family has overtaken me when dealing with many of the issues that have been brought to me. Some I have taken on board personally, and some have affected me very deeply, but in all cases I have tried to apply myself fully to the advancement of their interests and that of the community which we all share.

        have any regrets? Absolutely not. I am very grateful, firstly, for having been given the opportunity to be elected to parliament. I am also extremely grateful to the many who have assisted me in carrying out my role as their representative, particularly all my local branches, certainly the community of Gilmore, my staff, the

        . This is not a job that can be done alone. Whatever success I have had, and whatever kudos I might have earned, has to be shared by my many supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the people of Gilmore, thank you for supporting me for all these years. I hope I can continue to enjoy your support in the future. I am humbled by the kindness and generosity of spirit that has been extended to me. I could not have asked for more. Voters willing, I look forward to the future years together.

        and Shoalhaven. We also have a freshwater marine centre. We now have a medical school in the Gilmore electorate. We have aged care facilities that we did not have some 10 years ago. We have services for our veterans that we did not have 10 years ago. We have a young program for cadets and for our youth leaders in the Gilmore electorate. All in all, it has been a wonderful 10 years and I look forward to the years ahead.
