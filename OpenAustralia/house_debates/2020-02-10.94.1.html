       <p>
        I rise today to reflect upon the achievements of two inspiring individuals who live in my seat of Curtin: Professor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Newnham" rel="nofollow">
         John Newnham
        </a>
        AM and Mrs Annie Fogarty AM.

        </a>
        this year Professor John Newnham AM was awarded the honour of being named Senior Australian of the Year for 2020. His outstanding contributions to his local community, his nation and the global medical community have seen him recognised as one of the world's leading researchers in the prevention of preterm birth.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Newnham studied medicine at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Australia
        </a>
        , graduating in 1976, before travelling to the United Kingdom, the United States and Africa to continue post-graduate training in obstetrics. He became a professor in 1989, and it was then he founded and led the 1989 Raine Study, the world's first lifetime cohort study focused on pregnancy. The study was set up to follow the health of 2,900 unborn babies for life and monitor the health of them and their families. It continues today. The study was ground-breaking and saw an immediate result in an eight per cent reduction in premature births across Western Australia. It long-term impact can be seen in how it paved the way for Australia's scientific and medical communities to become some of the world's leading researchers into the health of unborn children, particularly focusing on preventing preterm birth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The stunning success of Professor Newnham's research and the immeasurable benefit it provided in preventing preterm births and improving the health and lives of Australians, both born and unborn, saw him continue to lead the way in researching the health of the unborn. In 2014 he launched the Western Australian Preterm Birth Prevention Initiative, and in 2018 he founded the Australian Preterm Birth Prevention Alliance, the world's first program focusing on preventing preterm births on a national scale.
       </p>
       <p>
        For his work John Newnham has received numerous accolades and awards, rightly deserved, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Medal
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        in 1991 and the Order of Australia in the general division for his contribution to medicine, in particular in the field of obstetrics, in 2013. Professor Newnham's life work has been and still is dedicated to the improvement of the health of women and their children. His research has led the world in preventing preterm births. Professor Newnham's work demonstrates his enduring integrity, compassion and devotion to protecting the most vulnerable members of this community. His service and contribution to this cause make him a perfect recipient of the award. Professor Newnham will continue to pioneer research in the field of obstetrics and will continue the strive to improve the health of unborn children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Annie Fogarty AM, another resident in my seat of Curtin, is Western Australia's Australian of the Year 2020. With her husband, Brett, Annie Fogarty founded the Fogarty Foundation in 2000 to help advance education, to support young people to reach their full potential and to build stronger communities. Under Annie's leadership the foundation identifies areas of need, supports partner organisations with philanthropic funds, connections and knowledge and develops initiatives that deliver educational opportunities, inspire community leadership and enrich and inspire lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation enhances excellence and high-quality instruction in schools by investing in education programs, teachers and school leaders. Through the foundation Annie has developed the Fogarty
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ED" rel="nofollow">
         ED
        </a>
        vance program, which improves the educational outcomes of children who attend schools in lower socioeconomic communities. This is a sensational program, which is delivering tangible improvements across Western Australia. The foundation's scholarship program for tertiary students provides financial support for a leadership program, enrichment opportunities and supportive networks to help develop future leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Annie is also involved with several boards and committees to help foster innovation and creativity in young people and is committed to ensuring excellent education and learning for all. Both Professor Newnham and Mrs Fogarty are outstanding members of our community who have committed themselves to improving the lives of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me also recognise and congratulate the many other recipients of Australia Day honours in Curtin, men and women who have dedicated themselves to their community and who have tried to put others first. They are a fine example for us all.
