       <p>
        I rise with a heavy heart to inform the House of the passing of local resident and shining light for the south-west Brisbane community, Mrs Ann George. Ann was 74 when she passed away a fortnight ago and was loved by many for her tireless efforts and dedication to help those less fortunate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among Ann's many achievements was her Project Love and Care program, which started in 2005 in her home in Inala with the humble aim of delivering 500 care packs to newly fostered kids. The project was a labour of love for Ann and since then has produced more than 50,000 of the kits, which include toiletries, a toy and a journal to remind kids they are special. When recently asked about the project Ann said, 'All we have is the children and if we work together we can make a big difference in this beautiful country we share.' It was only in January this year that Project Love and Care came to a close after Ann's illness became too much to bear.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst Ann was known for being humble, her work did not go unnoticed, with awards such as the Queensland Government Community Initiative Award and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        achievement award. To Ann and her family, we thank you for your work, your passion and your dedication to the lives of thousands of young Australians. Rest in peace.
