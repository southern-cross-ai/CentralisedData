       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate two members of the community in my electorate of Wills who were inducted into the Order of Australia on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year. I'd like to acknowledge and congratulate Denise Cauchi
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_East" rel="nofollow">
         Brunswick East
        </a>
        , who received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for service to the multicultural community and to human rights. She began her career as a journalist and then Denise turned focus to human rights advocacy, international development and social justice activism. She's had a career defined by her focus on peace and dealing with armed conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also congratulate Graeme Walker OAM of Brunswick East—it's a very good suburb for people who are getting plaudits!—who received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the air freight transport sector. He's had an executive career in a number of large logistics companies across that period of his career, and I would like to recognise Graeme's service on other community boards and committees, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Melbourne_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Melbourne Hospital
        </a>
        , and the John Fawkner Private Hospital, which is also located in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        These people join a select group of inductees to our unique Australian honours system. Wills, which is my electorate in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, is a wonderful and diverse electorate. It gives me great pleasure to know that people such as these call Wills home. They make a positive contribution to the social fabric of our community and to this country. They are deserving recipients and we're all the better for their efforts and contribution to our nation. Remarkable people! As their representative, I congratulate them on their service.
