        Last week, 90
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        participants and disability carers met in Corangamite to voice their serious concerns about the scheme. I and my electorate acknowledge the value of the NDIS. It is groundbreaking. But it is not working for many people. Colin, a self-managed participant and pensioner, spoke about the failure of the agency to pay him back $1,200. After seven weeks, and two letters from my office, it took our NDIS forum and a call from a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Advertiser" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong Advertiser
        </a>
        journo before the agency finally reimbursed Colin. Up until July, Colin was reimbursed every week. But
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        had centralised this process. Colin was fortunate; he was able to manage this shortfall. But for many others who are coming to the office, there is real desperation. Participants should not be waiting months to be reimbursed.

        Kirrily is a single mother of three who cares for her teenage son, who has severe autism. She spoke about her inability to get respite outside the family home for her son, despite his right to receive it under his plan. She spoke about her desperate thoughts of relinquishing her son to the state. At one point, she was suicidal. NDIA is failing to ensure there is sufficient respite accommodation available to meet the requirements of each care plan. This government must act now. It must listen to these concerns and treat participants with respect.
