        . Today I rise very proudly to place on record my thanks to my local chamber of commerce. It's nice to be here and be able to do that. I want to thank the new committee that's coming in and also the committee that previously served under Gina Field's incredible leadership. I'd like to place on record my thanks to Wayne Willmington, the newly elected president; Linda Kemp, the vice-president; Renato Cantalupo, the treasurer; and Gordon Henwood, the secretary, for taking up the executive positions, and also to the regular board members, Joh Dickens,

        My local chamber of commerce was established in 1927 and has been providing incredible support for all of the businesses in my electorate, including and not limited to advocacy for other things in our community, which includes better access to universities, school education and health care. It has provided advocacy with its document The Valley Vision and advocated for better outcomes for all of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am looking forward to working with the new group that are incumbent, making their chamber much more successful than it already is and including some of the other businesses that don't always get an opportunity be involved. So thank you to everybody who attends these positions on a voluntary basis. To the new members: I wish you all the very best. To the continuing members: thank you for everything that you do.
