        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Australia's growth forecasts are being repeatedly slashed. Why can't the Prime Minister give a straight answer and admit this basic fact? Why does the Prime Minister have no plan to deal with the floundering economy he presides over?

         Again, in earlier answers to questions I acknowledged the revisions in the forecasts. As we go into MYEFO, the forecasts will be considered at that time, as they are in MYEFO and the budget on every single occasion. I know the Leader of the Opposition isn't terribly familiar with the processes of budgets, having never served in those portfolios when he was in government, but I'm sure he's becoming familiar with them now in his new role.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm asked about the government's plan. One of the things that occurred after 18 May this year was the huge sigh of relief from those whose jobs and whose investments and whose businesses depended on strong and capable financial and economic management. The sense of fear from the Australian people about the Australian economy, if it were to have fallen into the hands of the Labor Party, was absolutely palpable. So Australians were looking for a stable and secure plan, a plan that we had set out in the budget—a budget which, for the first time in 12 years, is coming back into surplus. The budget surplus has been established as a result of the hard work of Australians out there each and every day, of 1.4 million Australians coming into work, and of having the lowest level of welfare dependency. This is what our plan is delivering.

           It goes to relevance. The question went to the growth forecast being repeatedly slashed—repeatedly.

            The Leader of the Opposition is right, the question did go to that, but it also had a second question about what the government's plan was. The Prime Minister has the call. He's in order.

            <p>
             I'm happy to talk about the plan that was endorsed by the Australian people and that was set out in the budget. It was for lower taxes, allowing Australians to keep more of what they earn. It's a plan that was opposed by the Labor Party at the last election—violently opposed by the Labor Party—who instead wanted to put forward $387 billion in higher taxes to impose on the Australian economy at the worst possible time. The global circumstances that Australia faces today were no mystery to the Australian government and to the Liberal and National parties, but they were obviously a complete mystery to the Labor Party, because they thought the best thing to do would be to apply $387 billion in higher taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are the investments in infrastructure, the investments in schools, the expanding of our trade capabilities and the reduction in business regulation, and making it easier to reduce regulation on how people can be employed. When do we have to wait to hear what Labor's policies are? As I was referring to in response to a previous question, the Leader of the Opposition has said that we will know about Labor's policies before the next election. So that's sometime between the end of 2021 and March 2022.

               That's what I was referring to. So we won't know what their climate policy is, what their economic policies are or what their tax policies are. But the Australian people know what our policies are and they voted for them. We will keep implementing them, despite the opposition of Labor.
