       <p>
        Politics is obviously sprinkled with vexed issues from time to time. They come into your offices, I'm sure you're all well aware, and it works something like this: 'If you vote for this, if you support this, we won't vote for you.' That's subsequently followed by, 'If you don't support this, we won't vote for you.' One of those issues where we see that debate circling around is renewables and the footprint of renewables, especially wind farms.
       </p>
       <p>
        In trying to land a position, I think it's clear to state this: if a community does not have a problem with the renewable footprint, then I do not have a problem beyond saying that I can't support the economics of it. For me, the economics does not stack up. But if it is the view of a community—and in regional areas, we're very much informed by community—that they believe it's something that will assist their local town, then that's their view.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would have to say that this is tearing our communities apart. I can name a town and people who are split down the middle—they are split in favour and against. I don't know about its electricity, but its capacity to generate disharmony in many areas, not all, is apparent without the shadow of a doubt.
