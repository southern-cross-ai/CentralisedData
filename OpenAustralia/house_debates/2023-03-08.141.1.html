        Deputy Speaker Claydon, happy

        . There is always so much wonderful community activity in Chisholm, and it is a terrific honour to be able to inform the parliament and the nation of some of the many events and developments that have been taking place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our community has always had a strong connection to visual arts in Australia, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Box Hill
        </a>
        artists' camp being a significant place for the Australian Impressionists. That is a connection that continues to this day. So it was my absolute pleasure and privilege to open
        <i>
         smART 2023
        </i>
        , the fifth annual small works art exhibition at the Track Gallery in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Waverley
        </a>
        . This exhibition is a real highlight on the calendar and is a platform for all artists in the community, regardless of their experience, to showcase their art. We even had Aileen, at 103 years old, who started painting in her 90s, exhibit her beautiful paintings. I'd like to thank the organisers for inviting me and congratulate them on their magnificent efforts in curating such a wonderful show, and of course all to artists who contributed their works.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also recently attended the
        <i>
         On the Street
        </i>
        exhibition at Artspace in Box Hill. It was wonderful to see the creative lens taken to familiar streetscapes, which were rendered new and fresh and spectacular by the artists. Well done to all who contributed to that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke at the opening of
        <i>
         smART
        </i>
        <i>
         2023
        </i>
        about Creative Australia and our cultural policy,
        <i>
         Revive
        </i>
        , and that was so warmly received by the creative community we have in Chisholm.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also had the opportunity to engage in a lot of activities with our schools recently. At
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingswood_College" rel="nofollow">
         Kingswood College
        </a>
        , it was wonderful to welcome new principal Chrissy Gamble. I felt extremely honoured to be invited to the inauguration service for her arrival. I was really touched by the beautiful ceremony and the thoughtful reflections from parents, students and teachers, and I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful music performed by the choir.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also attended the grand opening of the Nido Early School, an early education centre in Chadstone. It was just so special to be welcomed by Peta and the team. There was a gorgeous smoking ceremony and a generous welcome to country by Wurundjeri elder Uncle Colin Hunter. It was fabulous to see the rooms children will be learning in, and I wish the team every success.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government really values the early years. We have around 7,200 families that will benefit from our early childhood education policies that make child care cheaper. I'm really proud to be part of a government that values everyone from the very youngest to the very oldest in our community.
