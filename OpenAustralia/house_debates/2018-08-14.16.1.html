        One thing I hear so often from locals across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        is the need for upgrades to our local roads. This is why earlier this year we launched our local roads petition and began working with all levels of government to fight for much needed road upgrades. We heard from people like Ken, in Lushington Street at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gosford" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . We heard from residents in Saratoga about their safety concerns on Steyne Road, and we heard from hundreds of residents in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Empire Bay
        </a>
        about the need for upgrades to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Greenfield Road
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Back in March we held a community catch-up in Empire Bay, and over the weekend we held another listening post there. Dozens of local residents from Empire Bay and Bensville joined us on the foreshore for a cup of tea and a chat, and we continued this conversation. Sally Anne shared her safety concerns regarding young kids riding on scooters and bikes on already unsafe roads. Lynette from Greenfield Road told me that the issues include major potholes, excessive speeds and difficulties backing out from driveways. Certainly, on behalf of Lynette and others on Greenfield Road, I'll be fighting for an upgrade of this particularly important road in Empire Bay. I also heard from locals like John from the Bensville Residents Group, who said that Kallaroo Road in Bensville was a major safety concern for residents. And it was great to be joined by my state colleague, Adam Crouch; Taylor Martin; Mayor Jane Smith and Councillor Rebecca Gail Collins. Thank you for your continued support and advocacy on the important issue of upgrading local roads in our community.
