       <p>
        Country Australians have made an enormous contribution to the success of our nation, and today this House salutes the talented musicians that hail from my electorate of Calare. Take for instance rising stars West of Life, the duo comprising Bathurst locals
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sargent" rel="nofollow">
         George Sargent
        </a>
        and Ben Rudgley. They've been very busy during this COVID-19 pandemic, and their debut single,
        <i>
         Left My Side
        </i>
        , has rocketed up Australia's charts since its launch in July. Well done, George and Ben.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's also a popular Bathurst duo Momentum. Band members
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Webb" rel="nofollow">
         Dave Webb
        </a>
        and Lauren Hagney are well known to locals right across my electorate, having performed in bands across the region over the past two decades. They joined forces to release their debut album,
        <i>
         Subtitles
        </i>
        , which is being streamed on Spotify to no fewer than 62 countries. Congratulations, Dave and Lauren.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's Clancy Pye, an emerging singer and songwriter born and raised in Oberon with country music in her blood. Growing up in a musical family, she's been playing guitar and singing country tunes since she could walk. Her debut single,
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Lost" rel="nofollow">
          Get Lost
         </a>
        </i>
        , released in May this year, debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes country charts. Her follow-up single,
        <i>
         Heaven Can't Wait
        </i>
        , is a moving reflection on facing the loss of loved ones too soon. Clancy is the sister of another rising country star, Mickey Pye. A former Tamworth country music
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Maker" rel="nofollow">

        winner, Mickey is a world-class country artist that our region is extremely proud of. Well done to Clancy and Mickey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can't leave out Orange local indie pop artist Liv Mirrington. Liv is a name to watch for the future as she experiments with her organic and soulful sounds. Bathurst locals who made it down to the Victoria Bathurst last month to hear her play will attest to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding I would like to mention Jayden Schmich, Om Kapali, Daniel Szabo and Liam Fitzgerald, who make up the band Evergreen. Their single 'Itch In My Throat' was filmed on top of
