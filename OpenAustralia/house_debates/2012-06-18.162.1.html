        I recently had the pleasure and privilege of attending the 100th Nambucca Show at the Macksville Showground. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have worked so hard over more than 100 years to build the show into the thriving institution that it is today. It was in 1906 that the Nambucca Dairy Company decided to set up an agricultural society to help improve the quality of stock and produce. The world was a very different place in 1906. Information was much harder to come by than it is today and so much more was exchanged face-to-face rather than by phone, the internet or even the written word. What better than to create an annual occasion when farmers and their families throughout the region could meet, exhibit their animals, show off their successes and set a benchmark for others to aspire to, and all for the common good?

        The first show was held the following year, in 1907, in the paddock behind the Nambucca Hotel in Macksville. According to the book produced to mark the 100th show, there was a large crowd and the show was 'a distinct success, clearing around £35', which would have been a lot of money in those days. At this point I should say that in the forward to the book—and the book was written by the show secretary,

        —thanks go to Betty Trisley for her research and Donna Gaddes for formatting the words and photos, as well as to the members of the 100th show committee. The book chronicles the steady growth of the show and the occasional financial reversal due to bad weather. It relates the formation of the Nambucca River District Agricultural Association, the sale of the original showground to the department of education for a high school, the purchase of the current site on

        </a>
        and the raising of a loan to build a pavilion and other facilities. While the show remains very much about improving stock and produce, from its early days it was always seen as a social occasion. Even though we have vastly improved transport and telecommunications, isolation and loneliness remain issues for those working hard on the land and the show remains an occasion when the whole community can get together. I mentioned earlier the current secretary, John Harris. John took that office in 1976 and therefore has now served as secretary for some 36 years. It was quite appropriate that the 100th show was opened by John and, I think, a very strong tribute to his long service to the show. His dedication is typical of all those who have given their time, energy and community spirit for more than 100 years to build the show into the valuable and healthy institution that it is today. I would like to congratulate Michael Ettelson, president of the show committee, and the hard-working volunteers for all of their efforts over so many years to continue to produce such a great community event.
