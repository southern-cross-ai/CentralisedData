        On 1 July the Rockhampton region lost a legend of local government, a loyal friend to many and devoted father and husband, Councillor Neil Fisher. Neil's commitment to our region was unwavering, and he served our community with integrity and passion. His relentless efforts to enhance Rockhampton's region were nothing short of inspiring. Over the years, Neil's contributions have left an enduring mark on our local government and on the hearts of the people he served. One of Neil's most significant achievements was his passionate advocacy for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhampton_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Rockhampton Airport
        </a>
        . Neil's tireless work secured vital upgrades to the airport to ensure it could better serve our community. It was an honour for me to be able to deliver the funding necessary to bring his plans to life through terminal upgrades and establishing an aircraft maintenance facility. This work exemplified his vision for a prosperous future and his steadfast commitment to improving our community's infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neil was known not only for his love of aviation but also for his love of horticulture. This was evident in his involvement in the beautification of many spaces across the local government area. Neil inspired many to take up gardening through his weekly horticulture segment on the local news. Personally, I gained invaluable knowledge from Neil, especially about growing orchids.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond his professional achievements, Neil was a man of immense character, compassion and warmth. His kindness and generosity touched countless lives. If there was a charity event, you could be sure Neil was there to provide support and a listening ear to those who needed it most. I will be forever grateful for Neil's unwavering support during my campaign to become federal member for Capricornia. His guidance and encouragement were vital to my success, and his belief in my vision served as a source of great strength and inspiration. I extend my deepest condolences to Neil's wife, Sherrie; his children, Jessamine, Corey, Gabriel and James; his son-in-law, Anthony; his granddaughters, Ruby and Lola; and his mum, Shirley. Today, as we remember Councillor Neil Fisher, let us honour his legacy of service, friendship and community spirit. He will be greatly missed, but his impact will forever resonate in the Rockhampton community.
