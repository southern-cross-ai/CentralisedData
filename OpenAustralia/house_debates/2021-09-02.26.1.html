         FWC
        </a>
        to deal with a dispute about sexual harassment or harassment on the ground of sex
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) A notification may be lodged with the FWC under this section:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) by a worker who claims that they have been sexually harassed or harassed on the ground of sex in any circumstances connected with being a worker; or

        (2) The notification must be made within 6 years after the sexual harassment or harassment on the ground of sex occurred.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) If a person has made a notification under this section, the FWC must start to deal with the matter within 14 days after the notification is made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) The FWC may deal with the notification by arbitration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Note: The FWC may also deal with a dispute by mediation or conciliation, or by making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see subsection 595(2)).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) If the FWC is satisfied that a worker has been sexually harassed or harassed on the ground of sex (the
        <i>
         relevant harassment
        </i>
        ) in any circumstances connected with being a worker, the FWC may make any order it considers appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) prevent the worker from being sexually harassed or harassed on the ground of sex in any circumstances connected with being a worker; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) prevent further sexual harassment or harassment on the ground of sex in the business or undertaking for which the worker carried out, or will carry out, work at the time of the relevant harassment; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) provide the worker with a remedy, including compensation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) In dealing with a notification by a worker under this section, the FWC must take the following into account:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) fairness between the parties concerned;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        I will briefly remind the House that the purpose of these amendments is to do what the government said it was going to do, which is to implement all 55 recommendations of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report. The amendments do the following: the objects to include achieving gender equality, recommendation 16(a) of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report; the seriously demeaning threshold, recommendation 16(b) of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report; and implementing the hostile environment clauses, recommendation 16(c) of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report. Recommendations 17 and 18 of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report call for a positive duty and compliance powers for the Human Rights Commission. It's not in the government legislation. This amendment will put it there. Recommendation 19 of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report is to implement them. Recommendation 23 of the report is to implement representative actions to allow unions and other representative groups to bring representative claims to court as per complaints to the commission. Recommendation 25 of the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report is for the commission to implement cost protections. They're the changes to the Sex Discrimination Act and other acts that were recommended in the report that are not in the current bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        As for the recommendations for amendments to the Fair Work Act that were in the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report, recommendations 28 and 29 deal with the prohibition on sexual harassment in the Fair Work Act and having a complaints process to be able to deal with it. Further, the amendments have an extension of the 'stop sexual harassment order', as per the Human Rights Commission recommendation to the Senate enquiry; and they deal with the recommendation for 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave to be included in the National Employment Standards.

        </small>
        <p>
         I'll just make some brief comments on behalf of the government in relation to the amendments that have been circulated by the opposition, to essentially highlight the point that we have given careful consideration to each of these, and that consideration underpins the particular approach we have taken.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, in relation to paid family and domestic violence leave, the primary purpose of this bill is to implement the government's commitments in response to recommendations made in the
         <i>
          Respect@Work
         </i>
         report. This bill, in the government's judgement, is not the appropriate legislative vehicle to consider broader reforms to family and domestic violence leave. The Fair Work Commission is currently reviewing the family and domestic leave clause in modern awards. Further consideration of the issue of paid leave by this government will be appropriately informed by the commission's consideration of this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the question of representative actions, as outlined in the government's
         <i>
          Roadmap for respect
         </i>
         , there is already an existing mechanism to enable representative proceedings in the Federal Court under part
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVA" rel="nofollow">
          IVA
         </a>
         of the Federal Court of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Act
         </a>
         1976, and, given these avenues, it's not clear that a further ability to make representative claims is required. In relation to cost protections, there are mixed views on whether the model recommended by the
         <i>
          Respect@ Work
         </i>
         report and adopted in one of the amendments that the opposition has proposed based on section 570 of the Fair Work Act will actually address the issues identified with the current model. For example, as part of the consultations for the
         <i>
          Respect@Work
         </i>
         report, Victorian Legal Aid outlined their view that this model would still provide a disincentive for applicants, given it would not enable them to recover their costs, even if they were successful.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the interests of time, I won't go through a comprehensive response, but I can assure the House that the government have carefully considered the amendments on their merits, and we've arrived at the views we have based upon policy considerations such as the ones I've just run through.
