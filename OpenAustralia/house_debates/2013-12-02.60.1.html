         Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order, under 101. It is clear that the last part of that question is exactly the sort of phrase which Speaker Jenkins took offence to in the 43rd parliament. You will see his references on page 555 of
         <i>
          House of Representatives Practice
         </i>
         in that it invites the minister to comment on opposition policies.

           I am very pleased to be able to inform the member for Ryan that, following the press conference that the Prime Minister and I have done today, Queensland will gain $794 million in extra funding for their school students over the next four years. Queensland is one of the three winners from the coalition extending our commitment beyond matching Labor's level of funding before the election. You would remember that Labor took $1.2 billion from the school funding model in the pre-election fiscal outlook. They ripped it away from Queensland, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

           and

           . I am very pleased to be able to say today that Queensland will gain almost $800 million for their school students because this government are not only keeping their commitment to match Labor's funding but are going beyond that commitment with $1.2 billion of new money. We were left a complete mess—

             by the previous government. The previous minister for education, in the short tenure the Leader of the Opposition had in that role, ripped $1.2 billion out of school funding and he left a national model that did not include three of the most important jurisdictions in Australia. So there was no national model. He took $1.2 billion from the model. We on the other hand will keep all of our commitments. We are putting $1.6 billion in that Labor promised; we are putting in an extra $1.2 billion that Labor took; we are delivering a national model that includes every jurisdiction; and we will dismantle in the Australian Education Act the red tape and the regulations that Labor built in that made the model almost unintelligible and incapable of being delivered. We will not have a federal inspectorate, we will not have a school performance institute and we will not have all the levels of ministerial intervention from Canberra in our state and territory schools, so that we can say with absolute confidence that, following this commitment, no school can be worse off because of anything that the Commonwealth does.

              My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the coalition's election promise made on 29 August: 'You can vote Liberal or Labor and you will get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.' What guarantee can the Prime Minister give that under his plan no school will be worse off as a result of actions by the Commonwealth or state government cuts?

                 I am delighted to get another question from my own side with respect to the government's announcement today, and I am shocked, surprised, that the opposition has not been able to summon up the courage to ask me a question about school funding. Ataturk said that when the battle changes a good general changes their battle tactics. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is still using last week's questions pack and asking the same questions he would have asked before the government's announcement before question time, but I guess that will change with experience in opposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have good news for the member for Swan. In fact,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Western Australia
                 </a>
                 will gain remarkably from the announcement that we made before question time. Over the next four years they will gain $120 million more in extra funding that was ripped away by the former minister for education, the Leader of the Opposition, before the election. In the pre-election fiscal outlook, the former minister for education, now the Leader of the Opposition, took $120 million from Western Australia—punished them for the good outcomes that they are achieving—because Labor do not like the independent public schools model in Western Australia. They ripped that money away and the coalition today announced that we are putting that money back. We want the debate to move from this debate about school funding to something that really matters in education beyond school funding, and that is quality and standards—teacher quality, parental engagement, a robust curriculum and more local decision making—

                 And, yes, phonics. The member for Ballarat raises phonics. Yes—the coalition is deeply committed to orthodox teaching methods and phonics, because we want students to leave school being able to read and write. The member for Perth, very respectfully, has written on this subject and said exactly what I am saying today—that things like phonics are exactly the way to improve the literacy and numeracy of our students. She said it. She said modern fads are teaching our students to hate school, and I agree with the member for Perth about that and I am glad to have her on our team.

                 Western Australia will win from the decisions that we have made today. We are putting back the money that Labor ripped from schools in Queensland, Western Australia and the

                 </a>
                 , and the Western Australians will be able to get on with that excellent work they are doing in giving more autonomy and local decision-making to independent public schools, which is transforming public schooling, not just in the schools but in the communities in which those schools reside.

                  My question is to the Prime Minister. Before the election, the minister told Australian schools, 'You will get the funding but you will not get the strings attached.' Can the Prime Minister confirm whether the requirement that states do not cut school funding is considered to be a string?

                           that the former Minister for Education, now the Leader of the Opposition, ripped away in the pre-election fiscal outlook. This government is not only keeping the commitments it made before the election to have the same funding level as Labor of $1.6 billion; we have gone further. We are putting an extra $1.2 billion into school education. I can understand the embarrassment of the Labor Party—because they think education is their issue. It must really stick in their craw that it is the coalition government that is spending more money in school education over the next four years than Labor would have had they been re-elected. If Labor had been re-elected, schools would be $1.2 billion short on the funding they expected over the next four years. If Labor had been re-elected, there would be no national school funding agreement. But I have delivered a national school funding agreement.
