        Last weekend, we celebrated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese New Year
        </a>
        in Townsville, as we did all around Australia. This year is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Snake" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Snake
        </a>
        . I was born in the

         Year of the Rat
        </a>
        , which is apparently the best looking of all in the Chinese horoscope! A weekend of celebrations were hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        Chinese Communication Group and the North Queensland Chinese Society, which was established in Townsville when Townsville had a population of only 50,000 or 55,000 people in 1969. The president, Iris He, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Lin" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        took us through our paces on Saturday at the official launch of the Chinese New Year. We saw children dancing and singing as only children can. We saw kung-fu displays, and the Chinese Christian Choir were absolutely fantastic. This was followed by a dinner. I was unable to attend the dinner last night, but that saved them a considerable amount on catering! Over 200 people feasted and were entertained throughout the evening. It was topped off with a magnificent fireworks display.

        Names such as Leong, Jue Sue, Goon Chew and Chun Tie are synonymous with North Queensland. They have been a vital group behind the development of North Queensland and have led the way with philanthropy and community building ever since indentured labour and gold rush times. We are better for having them as part of our community. Jenny Stirling summed it up best when she said that the Chinese people have so completely integrated in our society and yet are able to so strongly hold onto their own culture. There is a lesson in this for all of us.
