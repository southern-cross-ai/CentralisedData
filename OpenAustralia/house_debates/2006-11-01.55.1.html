         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . Would the minister inform the House of changes to Medicare that come into effect today? Will these changes deliver better treatment to people with mental illness, and how will the new Medicare preventative health measures help Australians, including people in my electorate of Moore?

         I thank the member for Moore for his question, and I observe that he remains a very conscientious doctor as well as an influential and persuasive member of this House. From today I can inform the House that doctors and other health professionals will be able to deliver even more services under our great Medicare system. First,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         s will be able to provide patients with mental health plans, including access to up to 12 consultations with psychologists funded under Medicare.
        </p>
        <p>
         Second, GPs will be able to provide their middle-aged patients with risk factors with mid-life health checks designed to pick up problems before they become really serious. Obviously, this mid-life health check may well pick up type 2 diabetes. I should observe on that note the presence of kids in the House today promoting the cause of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_Diabetes_Research_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
          Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
         </a>
         and say how proud the government has been to commit some $30 million to a national centre of excellence for islet transplantation principally based at Westmead hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         Third, practice nurses will be able to provide pap smears under Medicare throughout Australia and not just in country areas. Fourth, midwives and other health professionals will be able to provide antenatal services for and on behalf of GPs under Medicare in country areas. It is estimated that, altogether, Medicare will fund these services to the tune of some $600 million over the forward estimates period.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know members opposite do not like hearing that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, but it is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, and it is measures like this which further demonstrate that this government will spend the money necessary—wisely invest the money necessary—to make a good system even better.
