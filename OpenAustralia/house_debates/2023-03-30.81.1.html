        My question is to the Prime Minister. More and more Australians are having to make difficult decisions to make ends meet. UnitingCare have told the Senate's inquiry into Labor's cost-of-living crisis that they're witnessing a surge in first-time support recipients who they describe as double-income-earning families finding themselves at risk of poverty, homelessness and financial stress. When will this out-of-touch Prime Minister finally admit to Australian families that they will always pay more under Labor?

         I thank the member for Casey for his question. The fact is that we are taking action to address cost-of-living pressures. We know that inflation is causing pressures in households in the member's electorate and in electorates right around Australia. That's why we've introduced cheaper medicines, why we're having cheaper child care, why we've got fee-free

          TAFE

         —and I've certainly visited the TAFE areas in the member's electorate, in fact, in the past and know the good work that they do.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll tell you what we won't do, though. What we will do as a Labor government is always protect people who are vulnerable, and that stands in stark contrast to what those opposite did, which was to establish an illegal scheme, robodebt, which attacked the most vulnerable. That's the contrast between this government and the former government. Sandra Bevan, who appeared at the royal commission, is a single mum of four sons who received a $3,000 Centrelink debt letter—

           Mr Speaker, on relevance: you've previously directed the Prime Minister back to the topic of the question when he has veered off it, as he has. This is a question about the cost-of-living crisis and UnitingCare.

           <p>
            I want to deal with this issue. At the end of these questions, there is a tag question about who pays more under which government. If that is part of the question, when that's included, that's inviting a comparison, and it's also an invitation to talk broadly about who does pay more or less under which government. So, if you don't want that part answered, don't include that in the question.

            <p class="italic">
             … it was these threats of taking money directly out of my pay or out of my bank account, from my tax return. … it was … such a weight on my shoulders. … I do remember driving home at night just beside myself with worry about this money and thinking—

             My kids needed me. They had already lost their dad. And I was trying my best to … keep the roof over our head.

            <p class="italic">
             The Robodebt Scheme has had a lasting effect on me … as it has on many others. It … made my mental health worse. It made me feel like a criminal and a cheat.
