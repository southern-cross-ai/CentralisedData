        Firstly, I happily join in the member for Fenner's best wishes to Tony. That is an unbelievable contribution. Slightly as an aside, I'd acknowledge how much we appreciate people like those in the COMCAR service. We are very lucky to have that dedication from all the members of that team.

        I'm very pleased to update the House on progress at the Magill Village, in the heart of my electorate. We've contributed $2 million at the Commonwealth level to a project which will lead to the beautification of the amenity through Magill Road in Magill, in concert with the Burnside and Campbelltown councils and

        that the tender has now been released for expression of interest over the next four weeks. I hope many people and local businesses, in particular, participate in that process and take the opportunity to put in a great application.

        I'm very proud of the support that we've been able to achieve for that project. It is going to be a great outcome for that part of my electorate, particularly for the local traders but, most importantly, for the local families and residents, who are really going to appreciate the transformation of that part of Magill Road. It is going to be a lovely place to wander down to, particularly on a weekend, to grab a coffee and take the kids. It will be great for local businesses and great for local property values, and I'm very proud to have been a part of delivering funding for that project.
