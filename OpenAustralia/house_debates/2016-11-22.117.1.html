        This year, 2016, marks the centenary of education at St Cecilia's Catholic Primary School in Wyong. As a former St Cecilia's student, having attended the school in 1986 and 1987 for years 5 and 6, I have very fond memories of my school days, and look forward to joining the school community and my favourite teacher, Mr Brinley, for celebrations to be held on Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1916 the first class was taught at the Catholic church in Byron Street, Wyong, with 15 primary and secondary students. Today there are around 350 students at the school, and countless former studentsâ€”like myself and my brothers and sister.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school was named after Cecilia Woodbury, whose fundraising efforts were integral to building the Byron Street church, and who was widely known for her musical talents.

        , the patron saint of music, seemed a fitting name to the Josephite sisters who founded the school a hundred years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school launched their yearlong centenary celebrations in March with presentations from former students and the establishment of a time line in the school hall, where each month an historical event significant to the school has been added, including floods and natural disasters, visits by the bishop, and sporting achievements of past students, such as Ken Wallace's bronze and gold medals in kayaking at the

        , students took part in traditional schoolyard games like quoits, skipping and hopscotch, as well as an art exhibition using past styles and techniques.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday the time capsule buried at the school 25 years ago by my brother Eddie McBride and Kristy Guise, the school captains of 1991, will be unearthed and opened, providing a snapshot of life at St Cecilia's in the early 1990s. Items to be included in this year's time capsule will be collected, including a

        It gives me great pride to inform the House that a copy of this speech, as it is recorded in the parliament's

Congratulations to the staff, students and the St Cecilia's school community on your first 100 years.
