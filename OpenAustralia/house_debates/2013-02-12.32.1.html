        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the government working to create safer workplaces and tackle the scourge of workplace bullying?

         I thank the member for Kingston for her question and do not believe it should be referred to in dismissive terms by the opposition, given how widespread is community concern about bullying in workplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Kingston has a very direct interest in this policy area because she led a parliamentary committee that inquired into workplace bullying. I want to commend her on that effort and that work, and commend the committee members who worked with her. It is a fine example of what can be achieved by parliamentarians on very difficult questions of community concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everyone has a right to go to work each day and to be treated with dignity and respect. Everyone has a right to return home at the end of their working day or working shift safe and well. We want to make sure that Australians are able to participate in workplaces that are safe, healthy and productive. But unfortunately there are too many instances of bullying at work. There are too many times in particular that young people are bullied at work—young apprentices, young people in their first job. Of course workplace bullying is not confined to young people, but some of the most disturbing cases have involved young Australians. Right around the country many members in this parliament would have met with people who have had particular concerns about work and working conditions or the working conditions of their young sons or daughters.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to pay tribute to two fine Australians, Damien and Rae Panlock, the parents of Brodie Panlock. Brodie was subject to absolutely relentless bullying at work and Brodie is no longer with us as a result. Brodie took her own life—an incredibly tragic incident in Victoria and the subject of a great deal of public commentary in Victoria. They, Brodie's parents, Damien and Rae, are brave people and they have campaigned for change.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am proud that we have been able to announce today that we will create an ability within the industrial umpire, Fair Work Australia, to resolve complaints about bullying. People who are being bullied at work should feel that there is somewhere that they can go where they will be treated sympathetically, where their complaints can be resolved. Our industrial umpire, created by this government, can and should play that role, and it will.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bullying has got no place in Australian workplaces. It has got no place in the treatment of young people. It should be part of our fair work system that complaints of this nature can be addressed, and we will bring to this parliament a proposition to ensure that in the future the umpire will be there to assist.
