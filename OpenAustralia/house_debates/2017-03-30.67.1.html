       <p>
        It is a pleasure to be able to stand and record on the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        the Turnbull government's commitment to jobs and growth. We are supporting families and communities, and we are supporting that through record funding in health. We are supporting jobs and growth strategies by record levels of funding in education. We are putting downward pressure on household electricity prices by an announcement that the Turnbull government made more recently and in and around the

        scheme too. We are saving lives by putting medicines through to the

        </a>
        , and we are defending 60,000 volunteer firefighters in Victoria from hostile union takeovers.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are supporting the principle of jobs and growth by stronger economic management. There has been no less than $22 billion in sensible budget repair since the election because we are getting on with the job. We are providing income tax cuts to middle Australia for more than 500,000 people, and we are making multinationals pay their share of tax, leading dividends back to this nation of around $2 billion, which those on the other side of this House opposed, and I remind Australians of that. The diverted profits tax, which those on the other side did support, has landed us $100 million to date. We are getting on with the job of creating jobs and growth, restoring trust in government, cutting red tape and getting rid of some of the skeletons that were left behind. And we are providing stronger borders. It has been over 900 days since the last successful boat arrival in this country. We are supporting jobs and growth.
