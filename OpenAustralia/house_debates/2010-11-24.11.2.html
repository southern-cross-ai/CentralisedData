        The Australian Taxation Office,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        , proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of new leased premises at the corner of Smollett Street, Amp and Volt Lanes, Albury,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . The new premises will replace the existing ATO office located in the Albury CBD. The lease for the existing property will expire in December 2012. It is expected that the relocation into a new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies and provide long-term viability through improvements in the siteâ€™s infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $19.17 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in September 2011 and be completed by October 2012. The developer will commence base-building works on site in March 2011 with demolition and excavation for the basement areas being the first tasks. The ATO is expected to take up occupancy of the building in October 2012. I commend the motion to the House.

        The current military transport and logistics wheeled vehicle fleet has reached the end of its useful life. To support the future capability needs of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        , a new fleet of 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles will be acquired between the years 2011 and 2020. The new fleet will include self-contained loading systems allowing a single vehicle to perform several functions by interchangeable loading modules. This fleet will replace the current Land Rover 110, Unimog, Mac and S-Line vehicles with a mix of unprotected and protected vehicles. The protected vehicles will provide increased personnel protection to reduce vulnerability to improvised explosive devices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The introduction of a new vehicle fleet will have three distinct facilities requirements including the receipt, inspection, fit-out and dispatch of vehicles; the conversion training of military drivers to operate the new vehicles; and maintenance training to support the sustainability of the new fleet. This project will include the construction of training and administrative facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        and the construction of administration, parking and inspection facilities at the gatehouse and entry at Damascus Barracks, Meeandah, Queensland. Training and administration facilities will also be constructed at Gaza Ridge Barracks, Bandiana, Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost of the proposal is $50.291 million plus GST. This includes all delivery costs of management and design fees; construction; furniture, fittings and equipment; contingencies; and allowances for escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in early 2011 and is expected to be completed by early 2012. I commend the motion to the House.
