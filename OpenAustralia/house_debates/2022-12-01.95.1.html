         Thanks very much to the member for Robertson for the question. I'm very happy to report that the last six months can be summed up in one word, and that is 'delivery'. Since May, I've been to every single corner of this country, from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait
         </a>
         to Tasmania, from the south-east coast to Perth, and just about everywhere in between. In the member's own electorate I've stood with him as we've talked about our commitment to deliver Avoca Drive, an important project for communities across his region. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , I've stood with the member for Hunter as we've delivered the funding needed for Coulsons Creek Road and the Muswellbrook bypass. I've stood with Senator Nita Green in the Torres Strait as we've delivered funding needed for maritime infrastructure and jetties, and in Cairns, as we've delivered city-shaping projects, along with Exit 49 in South-East Queensland, and launched the new electric refueller at Brisbane airport. I've stood in Yuendumu with the member for Lingiari as we upgrade the Tanami. And I've flown over

         . I've been to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
          Bridgewater Bridge
         </a>
         , to the Burnie shiploader, and to

          UTAS

         in Launceston. I've joined our members in the west in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Wycombe" rel="nofollow">
          High Wycombe
         </a>
         community hub, METRONET and Flynn Drive in Wanneroo. In Victoria, we're getting started on delivering, with the Victorian government, the Suburban Rail Loop, a project overwhelmingly backed by Victorian voters—not once, not twice, but three times at the polls now. And of course I've been here in Canberra, not only for parliament but also to inspect the light rail we'll deliver in partnership with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         government.
        </p>
        <p>
         But not only are we delivering on our promises to build a better future; we've delivered on our promises to clean up the mess left by nine long years of a wasted coalition government. We've ended the worst of the rorts, closing down the Commuter Car Park Fund, replacing the Building Better Regions Fund with two new funds totalling a billion dollars, that regional communities can actually rely on across all regions, not just some. We're supporting cities by delivering a National Urban Policy framework and establishing the Cities and Suburbs Unit, renewing the Urban Policy Forum and bringing back the state of the cities report. We're reforming
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         —that important economic advisory body, so trashed by those opposite. We've ended the political fights with states and territories, partnering with them to deliver the projects that matter to communities, right across this country. We're creating a strategic fleet to regrow Australian shipping. We're working on an aviation white paper to create and grow jobs in that sector. And we've started the work to get Inland Rail back on track and high-speed rail here in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been a busy but productive six months. The Australian people voted for a better future. It's one we're determined to keep on delivering.
