       <p>
        I wish to place on record my thanks to the many people who have signed my petition to have Herceptin placed on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        . These constituents from Banks number among tens of thousands of Australians—well over 30,000 to date—who have already signed similar petitions. It is an outrageous state of affairs where a family with a member who suffers from breast cancer may have to contemplate mortgaging their home to fund the treatment. These families face finding $60,000 a year. In a country like ours, this is a disgrace. The government makes much of its budget surplus, which is estimated at $10.8 billion in the coming year. On this side of the House, we believe in having a vigorous public health system so that, no matter what your financial circumstances, you have the right to access appropriate health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year, approximately 13,000 women in Australia are diagnosed with breast cancer. Of these 13,000 women, it is estimated that 20 per cent have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER" rel="nofollow">
         HER
        </a>
        2 positive breast cancer.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2" rel="nofollow">
         HER2
        </a>
        is a protein that is found on the surface of cells and, when functioning normally, it has been found to be a key factor in regulating cell growth. When the HER2 protein is altered, extra HER2 protein receptors may be produced, resulting in increased cell growth and reproduction. This often results in more aggressive breast cancer cells.
       </p>
       <p>
        Herceptin is a drug that attaches itself to the cells that overexpress HER2 protein and, by binding itself to these cells, it can slow the growth and spread of tumours. Herceptin is currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for women who experience and suffer advanced HER2 positive breast cancer, but it is not listed on the PBS for women with early-stage HER2 breast cancer, and its costs are prohibitive.

        Roche submitted their application to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
         Therapeutic Goods Administration
        </a>
        on 17 February 2006. The TGA approved it on 21 April 2006. The Pharmaceuticals Benefits Advisory Committee is currently reviewing the Roche application for PBS funding of this new application for Herceptin. The

        Network Australia reported on its website, which I accessed on 21 June 2006:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We expect PBAC to make their recommendation in August. In normal circumstances we would expect this recommendation to be processed through cabinet then formally listed on the PBS in December. However—we see no reason why it should take this long and are urging the government to process it as soon as the PBAC recommendation is finalised.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the women of Banks and across Australia, I endorse this appeal.
