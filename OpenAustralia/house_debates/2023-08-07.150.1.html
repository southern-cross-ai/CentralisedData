        On 28 July, Australia and the Illawarra lost a magnificent human being. Professor Justin Yerbury AM was tragically taken from us, his loving family and community at the age of 49—far too young. Professor Yerbury, Justin, spent his life researching motor neurone disease, the very disease which ultimately went on to take his life. It's a terrible and relentless disease that eventually affected Justin's ability to walk, talk and even breathe. But it didn't stop him living life to the full, and having passion and purpose every day. He was driven by determination and willpower. He told the

        and he went on to become a world renowned molecular biologist.
       </p>
       <p>
        His life was shaped by terrible circumstances:

        first caught Justin's attention after it struck his distant uncle and then a cousin. It took the life of Yerbury's mother, grandmother and aunt, all in the space of just a few weeks. He himself was then diagnosed with the disease in 2016. He promised his mother that he would do everything he could to find a cure, and he kept that promise.

        , a team I have been a passionate supporter of all my life. He had already at that stage completed a commerce degree but he switched to science at the University Of Wollongong, fuelled by the death of his family and loved ones. Nearing the end of his PhD at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UOW" rel="nofollow">
         UOW
        </a>
        , tragedy struck again: Justin's younger sister Sarah herself died from MND. She was only in her late 20s. I can't imagine how difficult that would have been for Justin and his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        This news did not slow his efforts. He drew inspiration from the great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Hawking
        </a>
        —they met and discussed the disease in their studies at Cambridge. He was in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , delivering a lecture on his groundbreaking research, when he felt that his thumb had gone numb—the workings of MND. A genetic test years ago had confirmed that Justin, too, carried the rare genetic form of the disease. And within 18 months, Justin required the use of a wheelchair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite grappling with the disease himself for many years, he continued to lead significant scientific research to understand more about it. He became the professor of molecular biology at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wollongong" rel="nofollow">
         University of Wollongong
        </a>
        and is recognised as one of the world-leading experts on MND. His research group was established and was dedicated to examining the disease and exploring strategies to observe motor neurone health. He received many rewards and recognitions, including the Order of Australia and the prestigious University of New South Wales Eureka Prize for

        Vale, Justin Yerbury. You've passed, but your research will go on to help many others.
