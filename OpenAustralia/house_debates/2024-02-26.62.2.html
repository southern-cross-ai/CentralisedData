        My question is to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . Over 500,000 visas have been granted under the Albanese Labor government in the past year, with more than 1.6 million projected to be granted over the next five years. Does the minister agree that this is putting immense pressure on housing, transport and basic services on top of the cost-of-living crisis already being faced by Australian families?

          The introduction refers to the minister's portfolio, and then the question is about a series of other portfolios. It is not a question to the minister for immigration. It doesn't in any way ask about his actions in the question.

           The question goes squarely to the actions and the responsibilities of the minister for immigration in granting visas. This is entirely within his portfolio, and it's an entirely appropriate question to be asked.

             Could the manager just resume his seat for a moment. I'm sure there's a way we can get past this, but the question is so broad that it is asking for an opinion. The question was regarding visas granted. Because of the nature of the question and the impact being so broad, the minister can answer the question, but it will be a very broad answer. It would be very unlikely anyone could take a point of order on relevance because of the way the question has been framed.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm going to allow the question. The member is entitled to ask the question, but moving forward I want to make sure that members simply can't be asked an opinion under the standing orders. That is going to be ruled out. Could the minister refer to his answer regarding the visas being granted. On the point of order?

                 The Albanese government is getting on with fixing Australia's broken immigration systemâ€”a system broken by those opposite and no more so than when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible. I'm proud to be working with my friend the Minister for
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
                  Home Affairs
                 </a>
                 to build a system that Australians can trust, helping us get the skills we need while bringing migration levels down to normal levels. We understand that competent and sensible administration of our visa system is something that is fundamentally important, ensuring that we remain an attractive destination whilst bringing migration levels down. We're doing that because of five actions the government has taken: closing COVID loopholes opened up by those opposite; strengthening integrity, unlike the former minister, who halved immigration compliance; ending settings that drive long-term temporary stays; tackling exploitation, which was another matter on which he sat on his hands; and targeting skilled migration so that we are addressing genuine shortages.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Martin Parkinson, the former Treasury secretary, described the 'absolutely and utterly broken migration system' as a reflection of 'almost a decade of wilful neglect', symbolised, as members opposite should recognise, by the one million visas in the in-tray when we came into government. Businesses couldn't get the workers they needed. Migrants and other workers were being exploited.

                     Resume your seat. This is exactly the point I tried to raise before: with a broad question asking about opinions, the minister is going to be completely relevant because he was asked about such a broad range of topics. He is talking about his decisions as a minister and the actions he's taking. He couldn't be more relevant. The minister has the call.

                      It seems that the Leader of the Opposition doesn't like being reminded of his record as a minister. Perhaps he should also remember what he said as Leader of the Opposition very recently. He said this: 'We do need an increase in the migration numbers.' He will say and do absolutely anything, this bloke. It isn't just about dividing Australians. We are focused on rebuilding the migration system that he broke.
