        In the heart of the Ryan electorate sits Witton Barracks, a unique military facility that was utilised in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        as an interrogation prison by the allied forces. The three prisoner-of-war interrogation cells inside the Witton Barracks site at Indooroopilly are the only surviving examples of purpose-built wartime prison cells after the commencement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific War
        </a>
        . For too long, this historical landmark has been underutilised and locked away from the local community, despite its prime location in Indooroopilly, on the banks of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_River" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane River
        </a>
        . I'm proud to inform the chamber that that is due to change. The Whitton Barracks will be underutilised no longer, thanks to the advocacy and the work of the Morrison government and the

        Council together. During my tenure as a Brisbane City councillor for the Walter Taylor Ward, I successfully lobbied the federal government to release the Witton Barracks to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        and place the land back into the hands of local residents. Following the successful acquisition of the site, I, along with Brisbane City Council, developed plans to transform the site into a green space for community use while preserving the historical heritage of the site, but also opening it up as a park, playground and community space, and as a landing point for the bikeway. As part of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, Phase 2, the Morrison government has committed $850,000 to facilitate the transformation of the Whitton Barracks, and I'm pleased to see that this project is now well underway.
       </p>

        Like me, the local councillor James Mackay is committed to ensuring that our longstanding plans for the Whitton Barracks site become reality for our local community. Both Councillor Mackay and I know that the Brisbane City Council and Morrison government are right behind the local community to ensure this project is successfully completed. Brisbane City Council are currently funding the bikeway, with its landing at the park, and we look forward to opening that very soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it comes to preserving our proud military history and opening up some of these sites to the local community, as a park and green space, the Morrison government and I are committed to ensuring that this happens. To see this unique riverside precinct, in the heart of Indooroopilly, which is a growing suburb in a growing area, opened up for community use rather than locked away is a significant success for both the Morrison government and the Brisbane City Council, for myself and Councillor Mackay, and for our local community. I am passionate about preserving our local history in our area and giving our families more opportunities to enjoy these riverside locations. I'm so proud that, thanks to the funding of the Morrison government, this project is finally becoming a reality.

         I understand that it is the wish of the Federation Chamber that constituency statements continue for an additional 30 minutes. Are there any objections? There being no objections, I call the honourable member for Moreton.
