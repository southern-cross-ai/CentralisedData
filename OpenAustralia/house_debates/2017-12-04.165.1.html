        The festive season is well and truly upon us. In my electorate of Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , we kick-started this on Sunday with the wonderful Christmas fair at Kariong, at Mount Penang. This was the 10th year of the fair, and this year it was even bigger than ever, with thousands of Central Coast residents heading out to Kariong for the day. With more than 150 stalls, ranging from handmade jewellery and candles to artwork, handcrafted teas and some beautiful food, the fair has quickly become one of the Central Coast's most popular markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was honoured to be part of the day, with our stall featuring some incredible entries from the 2017 Robertson Christmas Card Competition. Every year, primary school students from across my electorate send in their amazing designs, with the winning entries being featured on my Christmas card. My congratulations go to Eden from Chertsey Primary School on her winning design. Hundreds of people at the fair stopped to look at the students' entries. It was fantastic to see that these beautiful designs brought as much joy to all who were at the Christmas fair as they did to me and my office.
       </p>

        May I pay tribute to the organisations that helped make this year's event possible: Hoyts, Gosford Golf Club, Belle Property, Six String Brewing Company, Neon Garage, Central Coast iMag, Star 104.5, Fairplay Entertainment, the
