        I recently had the privilege of attending a series of Anzac Day services in my electorate. These are important events in the community, and I know how much people have missed them during COVID-19 restrictions. I started by attending the Altona
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        's regular commemoration and march through Altona the weekend before Anzac Day. On Anzac Day the dawn service in Williamston, a much-loved event, saw the involvement of many local community groups and military branches. This was followed by a lively community focused commemorative service in Newport, which drew a very large turnout.

        While it's great to again be able to go in person to events like this, organising them in a COVID-safe way takes a lot more work than usual. So I want to thank everyone for the work that made that happen. As usual, it's thanks to a small handful of volunteers giving up their time. Newport Sub-Branch nominee Mary Nicholls and president Bob Gladysz gave upwards of 100 hours each in the last week of the Anzac Day appeal. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at the Newport RSL Sub-Branch who went the extra mile to make these important Anzac Day commemorations a reality and raise a record amount for the Anzac Day appeal. So, thank you to Bob Gladysz, the president; Ian Nicholls; Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Dowling; Captain Phil Barber; Major Mark Bainbridge;

        ; William Malcolmson; Retired Major Gabrielle Prideaux; Scott Petrie; Mary Nicholls; the Newport RSL Sub-Branch members; the service men and women who volunteered their time for the Anzac Day appeal; and the local businesses and schools who contributed to it.

        The Newport RSL may be small, but it has a big heart. I know they will keep striving to provide assistance to our veterans, and they are very much valued by our community.
