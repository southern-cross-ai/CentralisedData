        I follow the great member for Macarthur in recognising that 22 October is Saffron Day, which focuses our attention on the special role that organ donation plays in saving lives. The inspiration behind the day was the incredible seven-year-old Deyaan Udani, who, while he was on a family holiday in India, suffered a brain haemorrhage and, sadly, passed away in 2016. His dad, Rupesh, who is a Chifley constituent, spoke with me about his boy and how they'd made the incredible decision to donate his organs. And that amazing gesture helped save the lives of four people. Deyaan and his sister Naisha had learned about organ donation at Quakers Hill Public School and they told their parents they wanted to help save lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saffron Day, which is now in its third year, encourages Australians to 'do it for Deyaan', and to wear orange to school or work—which is why I'm wearing this orange tie—and to register as an organ donor. As the Udani family say, a pinch of saffron goes a long way, as does the powerfully generous gift of organ donation. As I speak, 1,700 Australians are waiting for a lifesaving transplant, and a further 12,000 people are on dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant. So I'd urge everyone to have that conversation with their loved ones and to become organ donors. Registering is quick and easy; it takes less than a minute. Go to donatelife.org.au and register. You could help save a life. Well done, Rupesh, and everyone supporting Saffron Day.
