        My question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Will the minister please update the House on the action the Morrison government is taking to secure Australian jobs while ensuring that we have access to the affordable, reliable energy we rely on as a nation? And can the minister update us on any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Goldstein for his question and for his longstanding advocacy for Australia as a strong trading nation seeking open markets for our all-important export industries, particularly our energy-intensive export industries. He knows that central to the success of those industries is a strong, reliable, affordable energy sector. He also knows that this is absolutely central to our recovery from the pandemic, to job creation and to investment in this great country. And I can confirm to the House that our plan on affordable, reliable energy is working. We've seen 18 months of consecutive wholesale price reductions, with prices at their lowest levels for many, many years. We're backing Australian workers, we're backing Australian industry in these energy-intensive industries, often export-oriented industries. The strength of our commitment was demonstrated just last week, when the Prime Minister secured the future of the Portland aluminium smelter and the 500 direct local jobs that will create, as well as the ongoing indirect jobs. This is great news for the workers, for the community and for the local businesses as well in that region.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of the smelter has been championed by the shadow minister for trade over there, the local member, and of course someone who is also passionate about Australia as a strong trading nation and strong in export industries. The Portland smelter is Victoria's biggest energy consumer and this deal will ensure not only that the future of the smelter is secured but the future of the Victorian grid is too, with the flexibility that this deal will provide.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about alternative approaches. Well, we know that if it isn't to be the lower prices we all want to see it will higher prices. We know how much those opposite love a tax on energy, especially the member for McMahon, who replaced the member for Hindmarsh when he was sacked. How could we forget the member for McMahon's love for taxes, whether it's his retiree tax, his housing tax or his car tax? And he has gloated about his role in Labor's carbon taxes. But while those opposite continue to fight their internal wars, we're getting on with the job by providing jobs and opportunities for Australian workers. Those opposite would happily tax our aluminium smelters out of existence.
