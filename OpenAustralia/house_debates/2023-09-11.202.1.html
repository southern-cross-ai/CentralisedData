        The Albanese Labor government knows that a good education is a ticket to a good life, and we are unlocking investment. At the 2022 election, Labor promised to invest in schools, and we have indeed delivered on that promise through the Schools Upgrade Fund. A total of $218,000 has been awarded to nine schools in the electorate of Swan. This round of the Schools Upgrade Fund provides $32 million to schools nationwide, and we are seeing these benefits in the heart of Swan.

        High Wycombe Primary School, which is in my electorate, will soon commence work to upgrade its school. I recently had the opportunity to visit this fabulous primary school. It is a school that is high in community spirit. High Wycombe Primary School is a 60-year-old primary school, and it shows. Investment in schools was neglected under the previous government, but the money under the Schools Upgrade Fund will be used for much-needed and overdue upgrades. I see firsthand the work being done under this grant.

        The acting school principal, Stacey, told me how delighted she was to receive the grant. She explained that it's easy to learn in a clean and fresh environment. Freshening up tired areas of the school will encourage student learning, and High Wycombe Primary School students are so excited to do this. I had the opportunity to play chess with them recently, and they are very intelligent students.
