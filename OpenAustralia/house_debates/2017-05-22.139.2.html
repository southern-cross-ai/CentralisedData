        I rise in this place to stand up for Townsville and to stand up against the Turnbull government's complete inaction in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        . The Turnbull government seems to be hell-bent on doing absolutely nothing for Townsville's critical water and energy issues. What an absolute disappointment the federal budget was for Townsville and North Queensland! There was nothing in this budget for Townsville and North Queensland, and, to further rub salt into the wound, there was no mention of anything north of Brisbane. The Turnbull government's answer for regional infrastructure is a rail line from Melbourne to Brisbane. What an absolute slap in the face for North Queensland! This complete disregard shows me and the Townsville community that the Turnbull government does not see water security and energy in Townsville to be as important as building a rail line in the south.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, allow me to provide you with a state of Townsville address. Our unemployment is at 11.3 per cent. Our youth unemployment is almost at 20 per cent. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_River_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Ross River Dam
        </a>
        is now at 22 per cent after the city was left praying for water and, thankfully, our prayers were heard. Reports in today's
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_Bulletin" rel="nofollow">
          Townsville Bulletin
         </a>
        </i>
        show our businesses are struggling with skyrocketing energy prices. Harbourside Coldstores' energy bill will increase by more than 31.5 per cent. Sun Metals, a large employer in Townsville, has seen its energy bill increase by more than 44 per cent over the last 12 months. Apparently, to the Turnbull government, these issues are not important, because I can think of absolutely no other reason why the budget completely ignored Townsville and North Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Townsville will not be ignored. We will not be silent. We will demand action from this government. I have stood in this place time and time again giving strong warnings to the Turnbull government, stating that ignoring Townsville's and North Queensland's water and energy issues would be at its own peril. Now the federal budget has been delivered, and I see absolutely nothing for Townsville's water security and energy issues. The government has just added fuel to the fire.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, once again, Labor leads where the Turnbull government has failed Townsville and North Queensland. I was proud to stand with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , who committed $200 million to a hydro power station on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdekin_Falls_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Burdekin Falls Dam
        </a>
        and $100 million to water security infrastructure. Bill Shorten met with local Townsville leaders to discuss these issues, the impact they are having on the north's economy and their negative social impact on our community. Less than one month later, our region saw true commitment and some real money from Labor.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is just so clear to me that the coalition do not give a Burdekin Falls Dam! I would have welcomed a Turnbull government announcement if they had matched Labor's commitment. I am doing my job and what is right for our community. So, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and all of the coalition senators for Queensland: if you thought I was angry before, you have not seen anything yet. I will speak louder than before, until your ears hurt and until you actually deliver a hydro power station and water security for Townsville.
