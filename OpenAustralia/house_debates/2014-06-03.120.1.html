        Quality investment in telecommunication infrastructure is essential in developing a digital economy to support and generate job growth, particularly in electorates such as Dobell. The government are addressing the legacy of mismanagement we inherited from the former Labor government. We are committed to rolling out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        as quickly as possible, at least cost to the taxpayer and more affordably for consumers. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        is an integral part in promoting a new digital age, one where Dobell businesses and industry will be able to boost productivity and develop more efficient ways to conduct business.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Dobell, there is tremendous potential for growth through the application of high-speed broadband technology in industries such as teleworking, education and health. While local business and industry are eager to reap the benefits, the original NBN rollout ignored the businesses of Dobell. Key employment centres, including the Tuggerah Business Park, North Wyong Industrial Park,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         The Entrance
        </a>
        and Wyong were never considered in Labor's NBN rollout plans. For some bizarre reason, no consideration was given to the engine room of the Dobell economy. The small businesses of Dobell are collectively our largest employer. The Tuggerah Business Park would no doubt be the most significant exclusion from the previous government's chaotic NBN rollout. Home to some 200 businesses, NBN Co failed to include the business park in the rollout, despite identifying surrounding residential areas for access to the NBN. Rendering this even more confusing is the fact that the NBN infrastructure runs adjacent to the business park, yet no provisions were made to supply the NBN into the park.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the Labor government's chaotic mismanagement and failure to provide high-speed broadband to our local businesses, we have seen situations where local businesses have contemplated relocating from Dobell to areas with high-speed broadband. Thankfully these businesses have been in a financial position to finance their own broadband infrastructure, but this is not fair. Businesses in one region should not experience the disadvantage of having to self-finance infrastructure when businesses in other regions have these services provided by government, yet this is the legacy of the Labor government. Labor's chaotic mess and mismanagement have now resulted in businesses in other regions with NBN access having a distinct advantage over Dobell based businesses. I firmly believe that a key priority for the NBN rollout in Dobell is our business community. The NBN should serve as an incentive for businesses to relocate or start up in Dobell, in turn boosting local employment opportunities. With this as our focus, we would see a greater return on investment, more local jobs, increased productivity and innovative new business start-ups.

        , a staunch advocate for the NBN, has endorsed this approach by stating: 'We now know that more and more local people are engaged in work in technology industries, working from home or out of small premises, employing a small number of people. We call them start-ups, and even more are using the internet to work from home. With a large unemployed young workforce that is tech-savvy, the Central Coast has a resource that can be made productive, but to do that it is absolutely essential for the government to continue the rollout of the NBN across the Wyong region. The NBN got the rollout map wrong in Wyong to start with; they now need to look at where the major employment areas are and get them connected.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Another significant barrier confronting the Dobell business community is poor mobile coverage. I recently had the opportunity to introduce

        , Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, to key Dobell business stakeholders to discuss challenges encountered in regards to local mobile coverage and telecommunications. In the same way in which the lack of high-speed broadband acts as a barrier to business growth, poor mobile coverage is contributing to a lack of business confidence. Of particular concern are the Wyong valleys, home to our agricultural sector and growing tourism businesses, where there is a distinct lack of mobile coverage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dobell deserves better broadband services and mobile coverage than those provided by the former government. This government is addressing this issue by delivering on its commitment to invest $100 million to improve mobile phone coverage across Australia, and I am determined to see Dobell receive its fair share. This government is committed to addressing the issue of mobile black spots in Dobell and many other communities facing similar challenges.
