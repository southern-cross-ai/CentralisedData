       <p>
        This is the third time this month I have chosen to speak about the Abbott and Baird governments' historic infrastructure investment in Western and South-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        . Unfortunately for those opposite, for as long as I am fortunate enough to represent the good people of Macarthur I will continue to highlight the great work that the Commonwealth and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state governments are undertaking.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say 'unfortunately for those opposite' because coalition's unprecedented infrastructure investment in South-West Sydney and Western Sydney highlights the years and years of Labor neglect in the community, at both the state and federal levels. Having been a member of parliament during the final desperate term of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, I have had the misfortune of witnessing firsthand the destructiveness of a Labor government in power, but equally I have had the good fortune of seeing that very same government booted out by the Australian public at the last election.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we should not feel sorry for those opposite, not at all, because, as the saying goes, 'If you don't invest very much, then defeat doesn't hurt very much.' And Labor did not invest a penny in South-Western Sydney, so their resounding defeat in the 2013 election should not have hurt at all. Labor should have seen it coming, and I have no doubt that they did but chose to do nothing about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012, I distributed Macarthur's biggest survey to every household in my electorate and received a great response from many families, seniors and small businesses in the electorate. From the many responses to this survey it was overwhelmingly clear that my community was deeply concerned about two major issues: No. 1 is the carbon tax and No. 2 is the need for better infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        My community knew that Labor were not only responsible for their concerns, but that they were also an impediment to any change and that the only solution was to boot them out and put in a government that is willing to listen to and adhere to their wishes.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         The Abbott
        </a>
        government understands that the problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines. We have proved this firstly by removing the carbon tax, saving households in my community and across the country $515 last year alone, and, in partnership with the New South Wales government, we announced a 10-year road investment program of over $3 billion for Western Sydney, providing the vital infrastructure that my community has been calling out for for years under Labor. Work has already begun on the $500 million Bringelly Road upgrade, which will be one of the principal road links within the South West Grove centre, improving access to the new Leppington railway station and the M5 and M7 motorways.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to announce to the House that I met this morning with the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Briggs" rel="nofollow">
         Jamie Briggs
        </a>
        , who confirmed that work would begin later this year, as planned, on the $1.6 billion upgrade of the Northern Road, taking it from two lanes to a four-lane divided road along its 31-kilometre length.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Abbott and Baird governments are also funding the construction of a $1.25 billion new four-lane motorway, that will form the main east-west connection between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M7_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
         M7 Motorway
        </a>
        and the Northern Road. The $3.5 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan also includes a $200 million package for upgrades to local roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are investing $140 million in upgrading Narellan Road and $280 million on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Valley_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Camden Valley Way
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the $3.5 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, Macarthur will benefit from the construction of the $3 billion WestConnex, which will include the widening of the M4 and the duplication of the M5 East, significantly improving commuting times for those travelling from Macarthur into the city for work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Collectively, WestConnex and the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan will create over 14,000 jobs, offering perhaps the most significant economic opportunity ever seen in Western and South-Western Sydney. I am extremely proud of that fact. As a government, we are creating more jobs and opportunities for young people and we are clearly on the right path.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to this historic infrastructure investment, communities across the region have a bright future. On that subject, I would like to turn to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Foley" rel="nofollow">
         Luke Foley
        </a>
        's campaign against the Baird government's plans to lease poles and wires in New South Wales. Not only has Labor's campaign got an ugly xenophobic undertone to it, they are essentially campaigning to restrict the New South Wales government from the funding it needs to work with the Commonwealth in delivering on our plan to build the infrastructure of the 21st century to grow the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This morning, Luke Foley had the gall to visit Campbelltown Hospital to promise $100 million for a paediatric surgery centre.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Baird" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Baird
        </a>
        has already invested over $300 million in the Campbelltown Hospital. Labor promised that for 16 years and never delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have heard it all before. When they were in government, for 16 years, they promised countless times to provide the necessary funding and they failed to deliver. The Labor government will never change: a leopard never changes its spots.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to agree with the New South Wales Minister for Health,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jillian_Skinner" rel="nofollow">
         Jillian Skinner
        </a>
        , who this morning stated that Labor's last-minute laundry list of hospital re-announcements shows that nothing has changed in its 16 years of health neglect. It is groundhog day. Sadly we have seen it and heard it all before from Labor's conga line of health ministers and spokespeople. Campbelltown, Blacktown,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        , Tamworth, Dubbo, Lismore—all these hospital upgrades were promised for decades under Labor, and what happened? Zilch. Nothing—exactly right. You cannot trust Labor. The one thing you can say is that they will say and do anything to get into office.
