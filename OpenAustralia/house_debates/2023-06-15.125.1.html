        The one issue that Australians raise with me more than anything is the cost of living, and families are genuinely hurting at the moment. This Albanese government is doing nothing to ease that pressure. Between out-of-control inflation, interest rate rises, mortgages that are skyrocketing, soaring electricity bills and housing uncertainty, Australians feel simply forgotten by this government. In my electorate of Moncrieff, we're very fortunate to have an army of community organisations who dig in their heels and support those doing it tough, cleaning up the train wreck that this government is creating. Thanks to the Albanese government, many families and individuals who used to donate to charities are now unable to.

        I'd like to highlight a few of those outstanding organisations and express my deepest admiration and gratitude for the important work that they do in our community.

         Surfers Paradise
        </a>
        is headed up by Di Eadeh and Di Kozik, offering those doing it tough a hand up with food, clothing and wraparound services. Thanks to the team at St John's, and those who support them in our community, for always going above and beyond.

        Show the Way, who I recently visited in Southport, strive to make a difference for those experiencing homelessness and food insecurity and those escaping from domestic violence. They provide large and nutritious food boxes for $25 for people who can no longer afford groceries. Thank you to the passionate

        There are many organisations doing amazing work on the Gold Coast. Sadly I can't name all of them, but
