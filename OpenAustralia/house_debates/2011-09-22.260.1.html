        Last Friday night I attended the Northern

        Football presentations, which recognise the achievements of those who have been involved in the competition in that area.

        comprises 244 affiliated member clubs, 8,200 grassroots volunteers, 3,830 teams, 53,000 registered players, approximately 40,000 males and 10,000 females, and approximately 40,000 juniors and 1,000 adults. The

        4-3 on penalties after the score was two-all at the end of normal time and four-all after extra time. The

        first division premiers and grand final winners were Charlestown City Blues. The Herald Women's League saw Broadmeadow Magic finish as premiers, but the grand finals winners were Valentine Phoenix, who were runners-up in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012, the NBN competition will be expanded to include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Jets" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle Jets
        </a>
        ' youth league team as well as the newly promoted Charlestown City Blues. The northern New South Wales federation has formed an alliance with the Newcastle Jets. They will work together on school visits to recognise small-side football teams, volunteers and volunteer days. The relationship with the Newcastle Jets is aimed at promoting football in northern New South Wales. The Jets will administer the youth league and the women's league. That will provide further opportunities for football in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Northern New South Wales Football is Australia's third largest football federation, with over 53,000 registered players. It is a full member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Football_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Football Federation
        </a>
        and recognised by local, state and federal government agencies. It was formed in 1884. Northern New South Wales has a proud history of representation at national level. Since its inception, football across northern New South Wales has grown in strength. In 2009, New South Wales Football celebrated 125 years of football. To date it has produced 98 Socceroos and 27 Matildas. In the northern New South Wales jurisdiction there are 40 local government areas and it comprises seven zones. I congratulate Northern New South Wales Football League on its enormous contribution. I thank the chairman of the New South Wales northern federation for providing me with information on the services that the federation gives to the local community.
