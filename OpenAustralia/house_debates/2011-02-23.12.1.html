       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>

         bill
        </a>
        will allow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_and_Border_Protection" rel="nofollow">
         Customs and Border Protection
        </a>
        to conduct a 12-month trial of X-ray scan technology. The equipment will be licensed for the internal search of a person suspected on reasonable grounds to be internally concealing a suspicious substance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, an internal X-ray scan of a person can only be carried out by a medical practitioner at a place specified in regulations, for example, a hospital or surgery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will allow, with the consent of the detainee, an initial nonmedical internal X-ray scan of a person to be carried out by Customs and Border Protection officers using new body scan technology that produces a computer image of a person’s internal cavities within a skeletal structure. Where the body scan image supports a suspicion of internal concealment, the existing regime governing an internal search by a medical practitioner will then apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        The use, by consent, of body scan technology as an initial nonmedical internal scan will reduce the number of people referred to hospital for an internal search thereby reducing the impact on the resources of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        , hospital emergency units and Customs and Border Protection. In the 2009-10 financial year there were 205 detainees referred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        to be taken to hospital for an internal search, of which 48 were confirmed to be internally concealing an illicit substance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will extend the existing safety and training safeguards applying to the conduct of an external search of a detainee using prescribed equipment to the use of body scan equipment to carry out a nonmedical internal scan.
