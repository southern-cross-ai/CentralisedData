        The government amendments would establish an administrative scheme requiring a police officer to apply for an assessment officer for a post-entry warrant as soon as practicable following the exercise, or purported exercise, of powers under section 3UEA(1) of the Crimes Act. This section establishes an emergency entry to premises without a warrant. By offering a considered and informed review of this section's police powers by an appropriately skilled assessment authority, post-entry warrants are critical safeguards against the inappropriate use, or purported use, of the emergency powers under section 3UEA and, in turn, provide confidence to both police officers and the public that these powers are appropriately used. While the scheme does not affect the validity of the exercise of the powers under that section of the Crimes Act, the scheme would provide affected individuals with notice that the police may have used the powers in accordance with the legislation. It may also better inform law enforcement agencies about the appropriate use of those powers in exceptional circumstances.

        earlier today again supported the establishment of a post-entry warrant, recommending that the government introduce amendments to that effect. These amendments are quite important. As I pointed out earlier, they come about as a result of a recommendation from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Security and Intelligence. That committee looked at this regime and consulted quite widely with the Australian people and with the states before making this recommendation. These amendments thankfully have the support of the opposition, and I commend them to the House.
