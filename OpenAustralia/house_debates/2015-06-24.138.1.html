       <p>
        Tonight I wish to speak about the biggest sporting body in the electorate of Cowan and an organisation which I have had a long association with. It is a positive and constructive organisation that fosters the health and fitness of more than 5,000 netballers and volunteers each Saturday and during training throughout the week. I speak of the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association based in Madeley at the Kingsway Sporting Complex and just some 500 metres from my home in Darch.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDNA" rel="nofollow">
         WDNA
        </a>
        celebrated the 40th anniversary of their establishment in 2014, and I was very happy to attend with my wife Lara. There were just six courts in 1974, and now around 450 teams play each Saturday on 57 hardcourts. Wanneroo netball is a massive undertaking. Each Saturday the games start at 8.30 am and go all day. To support this huge sporting event, the northern suburbs netballers are well served by an outstanding committee of volunteers. Wonderfully led by President Judy McInerney, the committee includes Vice President Sallie-Anne Hoypoy; competitions, Helen Hitchcock; facilities and risk management, Malcolm Wright; finance and admin, Keti Vrdoljak; umpiring and development, Yvette Thomson. Other committee members are Sharee Hitchcock and Jenny Hodson. The open convenor is Trish Fox and junior convenor is Teresa Newton, and the sub-junior convenor is Kerry Menaglio. The Net Set Go! convenor is Ruth Raspa and the Spring Competitions is the responsibility of Helen Hitchcock. I would also mention the hardworking office staff, whose manager is Lorraine Ward, the admin assistant is Nola Stansfield and the development manager and Net Set Go! coordinator is Leanne Bruce. The umpire development officer is

        and the canteen manager is Joanne Higgins.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association is a huge logistical event every Saturday and a challenge each evening as teams come to train on the courts. The committee and President Judy McInerney will attend each Saturday well before the first games and will normally be there until after the final games in the late afternoon. When I think of the scale of the operation they run and how many players and officials have been involved over the 41 years, it really does say something about the number of people within the northern suburbs who will have memories of having played there. Many schools in Cowan have teams that play there as well, as part of the competitions of the winter or spring seasons. Apart from the regular competitions, the courts are often used at other times for the lightening carnivals of local primary schools or the bigger secondary school competitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an amazing facility and it serves very well thousands of girls and women, and that includes the many state players who started their careers at Kingsway. It is due entirely to the dedicated volunteers on the committee and the staff of the office and the canteen facilities that this can be achieved. I thank them and those who have gone before them for their very positive influence on so many people over two generations. Each of the many clubs that play at Kingsway depend upon the volunteer club officials, coaches and managers so that their teams can take the court each game. It really is an example of the very best of human nature that there is such a spirit of dedicated volunteerism in netball and amongst those involved at the WDNA as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts at Kingsway are of course outdoor courts. The grounds are essentially in two sections. The original set of courts is in front of the clubhouse and those courts have lighting. This is, of course, very important during winter so that training can take place. Obviously, with so many teams playing each afternoon or evening during the week when training takes place and with the days being so short, by the time the older age group teams can attend the light of the day is fading or gone and the courts require floodlights. This means that only about 25 courts can be used and training times will always see two teams per court and sometimes even three. Clearly, the expansion of lighting for the courts is required so that more teams can train and the games on Saturdays during winter and on Wednesdays during spring can, if needed, take place even when the natural light fades. I think that an expansion of the lighting at the courts is required. I acknowledge that the officials at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        have done good work in terms of better car parking but this facility does generate good revenue for the city and more needs to be done. More concrete around the outer courts to reduce the tracking of dirt, sand and other debris onto the courts would reduce the risk of injury to players.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that the Wanneroo District Netball Association is an excellent organisation, adding great value to the lives of those involved with the sport. I have no hesitation in continuing my support for their good work in the form of donations and advocacy. That will always be the case. I am once again pleased to speak of the great contribution of the Wanneroo District Netball Association.
