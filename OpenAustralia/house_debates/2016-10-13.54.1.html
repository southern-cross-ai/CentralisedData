       <p>
        I opened the technology wing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairo_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">
         Chairo Christian School
        </a>
        recently, and took the opportunity to commend the executive principal, Rob Bray, for his tireless work on behalf of that particular school and in education generally. I commend the Australian government's ReachOut program, designed to help students and parents. The pressures of year 12 were expressed to me whilst I was attending this school.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 1,400 students in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
         McMillan
        </a>
        have undertaken year 12 this year. I have to mention their supportive parents and teachers, and all that they go through in that year 12 process. The beginning of the exam period is 26 October. The stress has become greater and greater, but there are always opportunities to ease these burdens. It is normal to fear a whole range of pressures and expectations before this time. I just want to say to every student out there that has just done year 12: this is not the defining moment in your life. It will not brand you for the rest of your days. I say to the students that are doing their year 12 exams shortly: these exams are important, but they are not the be-all and end-all; you are. You will progress. You will go on and you will do great things. Keep that in mind. Do the best you can, but we want you there for the long run.
