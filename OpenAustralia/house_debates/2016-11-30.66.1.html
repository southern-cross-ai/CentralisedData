        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, thank you for your time last week and for allowing me to brief you on the proposal for a Tasmanian A-League football team. Obviously, a Tasmanian football team would be a wonderful rallying point for the community, would inject millions of dollars into the economy, would establish soccer as the only true national football code, and would boost
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        audiences. Prime Minister, do you share Tasmania's enthusiasm for this project and what commitment can you make to support the venture, and in particular the modest improvements to

        that would underpin this very exciting endeavour?

         I can see in the honourable member's mind's eye that the 'Wilkie Wanderers' are about to take off. I acknowledge his keen interest in attracting a Tasmanian A-League football team, and also the interest of the Premier. So perhaps there will be a competition between the 'Wilkie Wanderers' and 'Hodgman Harriers', being the names for such teams. There is no doubt that soccer is a large and growing force in Australia. The honourable member knows well the question of which football teams will form part of the A-League expansion is a matter for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Federation_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Football Federation Australia
         </a>
         . I am advised that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFA" rel="nofollow">
          FFA
         </a>
         will be providing all interested parties with more details of the framework for this expansion in the first quarter of next year. I encourage the honourable member to continue his advocacy for an A-League team in Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like the honourable member, and all honourable members, I believe, we understand that sport and the local infrastructure that supports sport and communities provides a wonderful rallying point. That is why we are supporting local infrastructure in Tasmania. Just last week, the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash, announced the new Building Better Regions Fund, providing $297 million for local infrastructure and community initiatives. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hobart_Oval" rel="nofollow">
          North Hobart Oval
         </a>
         improvement, which the honourable member has referred to, is eligible for the Building Better Regions Fund and, indeed, is the type of project the fund aims to support. Applications for the fund open in January next year.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are investing heavily in the infrastructure Tasmania needs to boost productivity and deliver the jobs growth that the state requires. We are investing over $2.1 billion to enhance Tasmania's status as the global hub for Antarctic research and Hobart as our strategic gateway to east Antarctica. That includes $38 million for extending the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_International_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Hobart International Airport
         </a>
         runway to support the Air Force's heavy lift capability and our new icebreaker, a custom-built ship, is due to arrive in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also made a number of other vital investments: $400 million towards the upgrade of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Midland Highway
         </a>
         , generating more than 250 jobs; another $60 million for tranche 2 irrigation projects managed by Tasmanian Irrigation; $60 million in freight rail revitalisation; and $26 million to upgrade the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooker_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Brooker Highway
         </a>
         . As the honourable member knows, we are also contributing $150 million to relocate and expand the University of Tasmania's campuses in Burnie and Launceston. So, we are supporting a strong and exciting economic future for all Tasmanians.
