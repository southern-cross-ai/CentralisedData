        I rise to add to my comments in private member’s business in support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of Peace, which will be occurring on 21 September. The Australian government recognises the overwhelming desire for global peace among all humanity. We as a country are involved in peacekeeping efforts in several places, including Iraq, Afghanistan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        , Sinai, Sudan, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Solomon Islands
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . Overall, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        contributes to the security and stability of these places and the broader global community. Closer to home, Australia is participating in the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. In spite of recent difficulties, the mission continues working to ensure that Solomon Islanders are able to go about their lives free from violence and intimidation.

       <p>
        As chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have been privileged to visit the Australian troops that are deployed in the Arabian gulf, Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor. What I witnessed from these men and women was nothing short of outstanding service. They love their job and are honoured to be assisting a country to strengthen its political, economic and humanitarian wellbeing. However, it is crucial for all Australians to understand that personnel deployed in these countries are there at the request of the host nation with the support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government is not only supporting global peace and conflict resolution by way of deploying these troops on peacekeeping missions; Australia also supports global nonproliferation, arms control and disarmament treaties, including the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the chemical weapons convention, the biological weapons convention and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
         Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
        </a>
        . We have also embraced new approaches, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proliferation_Security_Initiative" rel="nofollow">
         Proliferation Security Initiative
        </a>
        developed to disrupt and deter illicit weapons of mass destruction related shipments.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my belief that religious leaders around the world have a role to play in assisting and supporting the efforts of like-minded countries to bring about world peace. We must all work towards a common goal where all countries are tolerant and respectful of different points of view. While global peace is of paramount importance to everyone around the world—including individuals, governments and organisations—the issues surrounding conflict are complicated, deep-rooted and, in many cases, sensitive. The challenge of global peace will require a united effort from countries, religious leaders, the United Nations and other organisations in the areas of peacekeeping and conflict resolution, and it will require understanding and empathy for the core issues that fire up the unrest. On 21 September there will be a recognition that we need to work cooperatively for world peace.
