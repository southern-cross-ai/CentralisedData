        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister reverse his decision to slash postal deliveries to Australians?

         I will ask the minister for communications to add to the answer as he sees fit. The Leader of the Opposition is once again seeking to portray an issue in a way which does not accord with the facts of the situation.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Post
         </a>
         is responding and managing their business to meet the needs of customers during the COVID-19 crisis. That is what they're doing. In adjusting how they deliver services, Australia Post are no different to any other business around the country that is having to do just that. What the head of Australia Post has said is that they are keeping all the jobs. They're protecting all the jobs, but, like in so many businesses across the country today, some employees are being asked to do different tasks as they deal with the different types of demand that that organisation is faced with.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've never understood why the Leader of the Opposition seems to think there's one rule for some and a different rule for others. This is an organisation working to meet the needs of Australians during the COVID-19 crisis. That's what they're doing. The Leader of the Opposition seeks to make cheap political points in this place on a daily basis about the COVID-19 crisis. That's disappointing. What Australia Post are doing is delivering on their service charter, they're delivering to customers, they're keeping people in work, and they're adjusting their business model to deal with the increase in parcels, as opposed to letters. They're doing their job. I wish the Leader of the Opposition would do his, because those about him are certainly noticing that he's not up to that job, let alone any others.
