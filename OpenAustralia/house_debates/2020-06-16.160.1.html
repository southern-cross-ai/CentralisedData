        Deputy Speaker Gillespie, I want to acknowledge how well you look in the chair and what a marvellous Deputy Speaker you're going to be. Today I would also like to acknowledge also Bede Burke and his wife, Narelle. Bede received an AM. This is a gentleman who's done so much for his community. whether it's in the Farmer's Federation, egg production, or his involvement in the National Party, this person has always got a reason to find time to help other people. He's known for that precise thing. It's not only Bede Burke that we should acknowledge. There are so many in my electorate who received these awards. Whether it's Clare Doherty

        for her work in services to paediatric physiotherapy; Caroline Downer OAM for services to the visual and performing arts including her exceptional work for NERAM, which is our gallery in Armidale and something we're very proud of; Doug Hewitt, who is 90 years of age. I remember sending him a card for his 65th wedding anniversary. He's done so much work for the Armidale and

Bob Bensley OAM from Inverell for services to the community. One of the famous things he did, which was very apt, is he lobbied for

        —I gave her a call the other day—for her work especially in the Guyra district. She has been a continual workhorse, whether it's local government, environmentalism or just community services around Guyra. Bob Kneipp of Inverell for his services, especially as an alderman of Ashford Shire. He has been Lions president, Ashford bushfire brigade, just to name a few. Melinda Commens,

        I also note that the former member, Mr Windsor, received an award. I was always disappointed, to be quite frank, by some of the sordid innuendos in some of the tweets he used to put out, but nonetheless he received a reward, and that should be noted as well.
