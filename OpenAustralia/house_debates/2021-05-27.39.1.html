       <p>
        A few weeks ago I went on a birdwatching expedition with the Cumberland Bird Observers' Club, which has been incredibly active in my community for 40 years through the passion of local ornithologists. Every year its 370 members take 40 birdwatching trips across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Sydney
        </a>
        . Their knowledge of not only Sydney's birdlife but habitats and conservation is a great asset to our community. The club holds weekly outings as well as nesting outings for families and young children which is great because these outings give people of all ages the opportunity to grow in the love of birds. They also host monthly meetings with international speakers. Speaking to the newer members of the group, they describe how much they've learned through participating in the Cumberland Bird Observers' Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I took my colleague the Assistant Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Reduction" rel="nofollow">
         Waste Reduction
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Environmental Management
        </a>
        , who is an avid birdwatcher, to meet the group. We were taken to see the birdlife at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_State_Forest" rel="nofollow">
         Cumberland State Forest
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pennant_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         West Pennant Hills
        </a>
        . This little corner of our community exists today, having been regenerated through the efforts of the community. Originally, the forest was regenerated back in 1908 after its clearing. I'd heard about the group through my friend Les Nicholls and I'd like to recognise the efforts of Cathy Goswell, the secretary, as well as Pattie McGee, Lyn Eggins, Jeff and Julie Byron, Heather Cavanaugh, Pat Thorn and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Noble" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and to thank all the group members who've contributed to this great community organisation which gives people a love of the bush, which gives people a love of their birds and which gives people a really good education in the preservation of our natural environment.
