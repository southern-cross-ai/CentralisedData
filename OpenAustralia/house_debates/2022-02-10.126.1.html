         Lunar New Year
        </a>
        celebrations are continuing around the nation and, indeed, around the world. My wonderful electorate of Adelaide is no exception. I am very blessed to have huge Chinese and Vietnamese communities in the electorate. Adelaide has always been the stage for the biggest most colourful Lunar New Year celebrations and, after two years of restrictions and many of the events being cancelled this year, it was wonderful to attend some of them that ran a COVID-safe event. Traditionally, Lunar New Year celebrations start on the first new moon of the lunar calendar and end during the first full moon 15 days later. In Adelaide this important cultural event is recognised annually with celebrations showcasing time-honoured rituals, music, art, food, lion dances, lanterns and street parties. These were common sights in the city and around the electorate. It was wonderful to see so many getting into the spirit.

        I was very fortunate to be invited to join the Vietnamese community in the festivities at the Vietnam Restaurant in my electorate. This amazing establishment is one of Australia's oldest and most awarded Vietnamese restaurants. It is run by Mr and Mrs Phan, who opened the restaurant in the very early eighties. Those of us who know the restaurant well know that consistency is key. That's why Mrs Phan still cooks in the kitchen and the restaurant has maintained its original charm. Why mess with perfection? And it is perfection. Today Mr and Mrs Phan's children Linda and Ben run the restaurant and continue this wonderful tradition. I've known the family for many years. In fact, I coached Ben football when he was a young lad, when he played with my boys.

       <p>
        The Vietnam Restaurant celebrated with music, dragon dances and firecrackers, to the joy of the many, many patrons who were there. I particularly enjoyed feeding the dragons the lucky envelopes; that's always a great event. My thanks and congratulations go to all the amazing talented performers—and of course the food, as always, was amazing.
       </p>

        The electorate of Adelaide is truly spoilt for choice when it comes to culture, diversity and amazing places to eat. A lot of these restaurants have done it tough this year and last year, with COVID. This year is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Tiger" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Tiger
        </a>
        . The tiger is known as the king of all beasts, symbolising strength and courage—and we can certainly use some of that spirit as we enter our third year of this pandemic. I wish all the families who are celebrating Lunar New Year the best of luck—and kung hei fat choi!
