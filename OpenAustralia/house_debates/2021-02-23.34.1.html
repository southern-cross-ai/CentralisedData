        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House how the Morrison government's actions to secure an Australian way out of the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting our health and our economy, and how these responses are leading the world?

         I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. Australia's health and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic is well known, and it is world leading. Australians know they live in a country today that, unlike so many around the world, is able to point to a response from the Australian people first and foremost, supported by governments across the country, particularly the Commonwealth government, to ensure that Australia is able to progress through one of the most challenging time in our nation's history since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . It means that today Australia's COVID-19 case rates are amongst the lowest in the world—the second lowest in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         , in fact, I'm advised—and our fatality rate is the third lowest in the OECD.
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been $22 billion in specific COVID-19 health support from this government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes the $6.5 billion in support for the COVID-19 vaccine program and treatments. That health response also includes the significant support provided in partnership with state governments to assist the mental health of Australians. I met with Professor Pat McGorry earlier today, as I know a number of members have. Australia's response to the mental health challenges through this COVID-19 pandemic has also been world leading. It is something that other nations have noticed. I think it says a lot about Australians that it is not just the physical health issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic that we as a government and as a people responded to; we understood the strain, we understood the anxiety, and we provided those mental health supports as well as ensured that the economic supports were in place to assist people through.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vaccination program has begun. It is rolling out, and tens of thousands of Australians in priority areas are receiving those vaccinations. Another 166,000 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines have touched down, further supporting the vaccination effort. That means we move into a new phase with the vaccination program; we move from those short-term emergency supports into long-term supports. That is what we have done today in making the long-term decision to lift the JobSeeker base rate by $50 a fortnight.
        </p>
        <p>
         We come into a new phase in this vaccination program where we seek to normalise the economic supports as well as the many other arrangements that are in place. That means we are transferring to a new base rate for JobSeeker, which will provide long-term support for people who find themselves in need of that support should they lose their job. But the best form of welfare is a job, and that's why we are backing it up with the mutual obligation requirements. We're doing everything we can to get Australians into work.
