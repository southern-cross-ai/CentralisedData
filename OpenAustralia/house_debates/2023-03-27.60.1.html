       <p>
        Last week, I had the great pleasure of presenting Fred Denny from Thirlmere with a certificate to mark his upcoming 100th birthday. Fred's achieved so many remarkable things in the course of his hundred years. Firstly, I congratulate him on receiving the Order of Australia medal last year for his service in the

        with the 55th/53rd Battalion, the Mice of Moresby. A lance corporal, Fred served in the Army from 1940 to 1945 and was a frontline gunner on the battlefields. Fred, a butcher by trade, enlisted in the Army at the age of 18 against the advice of his best mate Brandon Chiddy, who later became a

        in Borneo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, Fred continues to serve and volunteer with the Picton-Thirlmere-Bargo

        sub-branch. He was a regular attendee at the Thirlmere Anzac Day service and often travels to the city to join his battalion mates to commemorate. Fred left school at the age of 10 to deliver meat for a butcher shop with his father. Aged 11 and 12, he used to drive cattle the family bought in Camden to
