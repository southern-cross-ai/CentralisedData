        I am pleased to advise the House that on 29 July a by-election was held for the position of mayor in

        -Hastings Council. It was great to see a strong field of five candidates putting their name forward for what is an important role in the future of the City of Port Macquarie and an important role in the shire. The Port Macquarie-Hastings shire is a strong, growing area that is seeing new businesses thriving and strong business growth. Port Macquarie is a vibrant coastal city. I'm delighted to congratulate Peta Pinson as the new mayor. She put her name forward and took the big step from being a business owner directly to the position of mayor. I'm sure it's a very challenging position. I know that she will do a great job as the incoming mayor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate outgoing mayor

        , who served since 2012 until May this year. I wish him well in his future endeavours. I have certainly had a constructive relationship with Peter since the City of Port Macquarie came within the boundaries of Cowper at the last election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peta Pinson brings a wealth of business experience to the role, and I think that that business perspective will be welcome. It will ensure that local government in the City of Port Macquarie has a strong business focus. It is absolutely vital that we have a local government sector that is proactive in creating jobs and opportunities, and I think there is a great opportunity for all levels of government to work together. I'm certainly pleased that, with the member for Oxley,

        , I met with Mayor Pinson so early in her term to discuss ways in which the federal and state governments can work together with the new mayor. I also know she has a very good relationship with the member for Port Macquarie,

        , and I certainly look forward to our working together constructively.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mayor Pinson has a strong focus on road safety, which gels well with the federal government's commitment of $5.64 billion for upgrading the

        , our Roads to Recovery program and our Bridges Renewal program. Mayor Pinson is also very keen to ensure that council's tendering processes provide for the allocation of tenders to local suppliers, which is so important in creating jobs. The federal government is focused on creating jobs along the
