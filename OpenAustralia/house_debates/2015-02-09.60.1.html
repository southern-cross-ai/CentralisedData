       <p>
        In the lead-up to the Chinese new year, last weekend I was proud to host another successful community event to welcome in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Sheep" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Sheep
        </a>
        . Building on last year's event, my electorate's celebration of this year's 2015 lunar new year was held at Holsworthy High School. It was pleasing to see our local Chinese community embrace the event, along with many hundreds of locals from the surrounding areas. The event kicked off with the traditional lion dance, which caught everyone's attention. And, not surprisingly, many lined up to take a photo with a lucky lion.

        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many volunteers who helped make the event such a success. Particular thanks go to iron chef Bob Wu, who again was a crowd favourite with his cooking demonstration. This year Iron Chef Wu taught a willing audience how to make Chinese dumplings, and there was no shortage of people ready to taste the finished product, including myself. Thanks also go to the team from Complete Self Defence at Moorebank, who performed an outstanding exhibition of the martial art Hapkido. It was lovely to see the young children and adults demonstrate their skills and discipline under the careful guidance of their instructors, Jimmy Trinh and Adrian Low. Finally, I would like to thank Cindy Ren and her army of volunteers. I would also like to thank the businesses that supported the event, including Diamond Spring Water, Hello Holidays, Kangaroo Collection,
