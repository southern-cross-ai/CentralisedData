        Ipswich has a proud sporting history. Our region has produced stars like

        In Blair, sport and recreation have always made up an important part of community life. Participating in sport gives participants a sense of achievement and improves self-esteem. Sport teaches teamwork, cooperation and respect. It builds character; it teaches people to win with humility and to lose with grace. Active participation in recreational sports is linked to improved mental health and concentration, and it's a great way for kids and adults to relieve stress and anxiety.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I've created the Blair Sports Links directory to help parents, carers and adults in our community to connect with clubs that will help adults and children in Blair live healthier, fuller and more enjoyable lives. We're about to enter our 10th year of the Blair Disability Links and Blair Seniors Links booklets. We've handed out over 100,000 of these to community groups, individuals and carers in Blair over that time. These are valuable resources, and I'm proud to extend that service to our sporting community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank clubs and organisations around Ipswich, the Somerset region and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karana_Downs" rel="nofollow">

       </p>

        I held a sporting-related event just recently when I hosted some of the region's youngest sporting stars at an event at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI" rel="nofollow">

        in Ipswich. The Australian Sports Commission's Local Sporting Champions program gives young athletes in Blair grants of between $500 and $700 to participate in travel to sporting competitions. At the ceremony, I told local athletes that selection and participation in a wide range of sports is tremendous for our local community. Brittany Else attended the school golf state championships in Kingaroy. Poppy Wilson attended the School Sport Australia national Swimming Championships in Hobart. Kate Galbraith and Natasha Heit represented Queensland in the National Artistic Roller Skating Championships in

       <p>
        My hope in starting the Blair Sports Links directory is that it will connect these young people and give young people like these access to teams and organisationsâ€”that it will help them achieve their potential and foster their ambition. I have every confidence that the Blair Sports Links directory will assist young people and their families across our region, and I encourage all clubs to get involved in the next edition.
