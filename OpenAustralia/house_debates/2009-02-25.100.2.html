        Imparja is allegedly a free-to-air satellite television service, one of a number of providers that make up the remote area broadcast service, better known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RABS" rel="nofollow">
         RABS
        </a>
        . Imparja is predominantly beamed over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        and part of its service is in support of the domestic tourism industry. It is also relied upon by travellers who do not have access to the usual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF" rel="nofollow">
         UHF
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF" rel="nofollow">
         VHF
        </a>
        signals.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the current global economic downturn our domestic tourism industry is being seen as a vital economic component that can help to keep the wolves at bay. The domestic tourism industry in Northern Australia is comprised of road tourists. They are often referred to as the grey nomads, but more and more young people and their families are opting to take touring holidays in Australia. Families are the future for the industry. They are also the biggest camping group. This is only good news for an economy under threat.

         In September
        </a>
        last year Imparja decided to no longer provide access to satellite service to those viewers located outside the normal UHF and VHF reception areas. This decision means that the road tourists who relied on bulletins and information through Imparja do not have a viable alternative. During a fact-finding tour last year as the shadow spokesperson on road tourism, the importance of real-time information for road travellers especially in remote areas was made apparent to me. In early December of last year Imparja television announced that it would once again continue to offer its service to those viewers who are in an out-of-area reception area and travellers, albeit with a $55 fee. For those in an out-of-area reception area a one-off fee of $55 is payable and for those travelling around Australia a yearly fee of $55 is payable. To receive the service only new viewers in out-of-area reception areas are liable for this fee. However, all viewers who are travellers are liable for the yearly fee of $55.

        Imparja television is supposed to be a free-to-air television channel and so by definition should actually be free of charge. I have two concerns at this state of affairs. Firstly, why is there a charge on a supposed free-to-air service? Secondly, given the governmentâ€™s interest at stimulating our local economy to the tune of a possible $200 billion debt, why has this antistimulatory measure been allowed to go unchecked? The government must intervene to absorb this contradictory and counterproductive fee for those travelling Australians who I know from my own experiences rely so heavily on Imparja television and other satellite service stations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Imparja threatens to open the door to charges for free services across the board. The minister cannot wash his hands by throwing the blame to commercial considerations. I am naturally worried that once the dust settles this practice may be adopted by other free-to-air television stations around Australia. The government must ensure that free-to-air television is actually free and absorb this unacceptable fee for a number of very good reasons.
