        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Customs Legislation Amendment (Controlled Trials and Other Measures) Bill 2022 will amend the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) to establish a new regulatory framework (known as regulatory sandboxes) to undertake time-limited trials of trade and customs practices and technologies, with approved entities, in a controlled regulatory environment, before committing to legislative change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulatory sandboxes ensure regulation keeps pace with industry developments, remains fit for purpose and does not become a barrier to innovation and productivity. This is among the first regulatory sandbox mechanisms identified within a customs framework, worldwide.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will enable the modification or waiver of existing licensing, importing and exporting obligations under the Customs Act, for trial periods of 12 to 18 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill seeks to encourage innovation through testing new customs practices and technologies, as well as regulatory approaches and business models, with appropriate safeguards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Results from the trials will build the evidence base to inform longer term regulatory reform and simplification of Australia's trade system, while maintaining and achieving Australia's border security objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will enable Australia's whole-of-government simplified trade system agenda, which seeks to simplify and digitise the trade system to deliver tangible benefits for Australian businesses, enable trade growth and better protect the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        More streamlined and innovative customs practices and technologies will lead to reduced costs and delays for businesses operating at the border, having flow-on effects and benefits to consumers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also make a number of technical amendments to the Customs Act, including to provisions relating to notices of intention to propose customs tariff alterations to clarify the legislative arrangements for these instruments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
