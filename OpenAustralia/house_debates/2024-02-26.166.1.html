       <p>
        I'm very proud to represent the second-largest Indigenous population in Australia. The disparities between Indigenous and non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        are particularly stark in regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , which is why I am particularly concerned about the government's approach to Indigenous affairs. The Albanese government promised everything with the Voice, yet it's now been more than four months since the referendum and we are still waiting for the government to announce or, indeed, deliver its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_B" rel="nofollow">
         Plan B
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The referendum didn't just cost Australians $450 million; sadly, it also left many Indigenous Australians feeling rejected by the rest of the country. You can't blame people for feeling that way. After all, the Voice was presented as the only way forward. Who can forget the Voice ad which told young people that without the Voice they simply weren't going to make it or that they had no control over their own life or that there is no hope? What a disgraceful thing to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is apparent to everyone that things need to change. We saw from this year's
        <i>
         Closing the gap
        </i>
        report that we're not meeting our targets. In fact, only four are on track and some are heading in the wrong direction. But this is not due to a lack of resources. A lot of money is effectively being wasted on Indigenous affairs, and I believe we need an audit into spending. This would be an important step towards understanding where government resources can be better used. We need to look at where efforts are producing positive outcomes and stop funnelling money into places where it is not working. Quite simply, the status quo cannot continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next we must support the next generation to reach its full potential. As was often noted during the Voice campaign, an Indigenous young man is more likely to go to jail than to go to university. We need to ensure that Indigenous youth stay engaged with their education and that kids stop having children. Investment in diversionary programs should be a central component of this strategy. Importantly, we must ensure that Indigenous children are growing up in a safe environment. Unfortunately, we know that far too many Indigenous children are the victims of abuse. A royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities would provide direction for the Australian government and allow a targeted approach to combating this very serious issue. It's common sense that preventing trauma should be the No. 1 priority for this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another important factor is tackling drug and alcohol abuse. The cashless debit card was a game changer for vulnerable communities that were experiencing high levels of substance abuse. I saw firsthand the difference it made in the East Kimberley. Income management meant that there was money for school lunches and food on the table rather than for buying alcohol and drugs for parents. The government's decision to remove the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
         CDC
        </a>
        resulted in an uptick in substance abuse and crime across the trial sites. I believe we need to reimplement the CDC. We have seen the recent events in Broome, with the introduction of further liquor restrictions by the state government demonstrating that we should take very seriously the expansion of the CDC. This will assist the fight against family and domestic violence that is often fuelled by alcohol and drug abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        crime statistics show that family assaults are on the rise. In December the rate of family assaults in metropolitan Perth was 70 per 100,000, while in the regions more broadly it was 247. Shockingly, in the Kimberley there were 1,163 assaults per 100,000 people. This is unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 14 October, Australians overwhelmingly rejected the Prime Minister's untested Voice model. This was not a rejection of Aboriginal people—and I want to underline that. This was not a rejection of Aboriginal people. All Australians want to see our Indigenous children have all the opportunities that non-Indigenous children have.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge that Indigenous affairs are not easy. But to make a change—a real and lasting change—we need leadership and we need courage. I'm calling on the government to get the courage. Tip everything upside down on the table and start again, because clearly what we're doing is not helping the people that I represent in Durack.

           I thank the member for Durack for shining a light on the continuing challenges facing Australian governments in closing the gap of disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
            Torres Strait Islander
           </a>
           people. Like my electorate of Hasluck, the member's electorate of Durack has a strong representation of diverse Aboriginal communities. When you strip away the political rhetoric in this motion it shows that the member for Durack cares, as I do, about improving outcomes. We share that common goal.
          </p>
          <p>
           These are complex problems precisely because of their genesis. We must remain cognisant of the impact that the wholesale displacement of people from land, language and culture has had and the ways in which governments therefore need to respond. As the Uluru Statement from the Heart so graciously invited us to do, we need to continue to listen and be led by these communities. That statement closes with these words:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We invite you to walk with us—
          </p>
          <p>
           walk with us—
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.
          </p>
          <p>
           I thank the member for the opportunity to speak on the government's commitment to a considered, deliberate and methodical approach to closing the gap. The Albanese government, with the leadership of Minister Burney, has engaged deeply with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to better prepare and implement policies that are community centred and that have an opportunity to provide sustainable, ongoing, positive impacts and success.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have, among other things, created the new remote jobs program, funded 500
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations

           health workers, improved access to safe and reliable drinking water in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           , committed $100 million for housing and essential infrastructure on Northern Territory homelands, provided housing for remote Northern Territory communities and created a landmark justice and reinvestment package to improve the community's safety and reduce incarceration rates. We've had over 14,000 First Nations students enrol in fee-free
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
            TAFE

           , improved access to renal services in remote communities, started on our plan to double Indigenous rangers by 2030 and supported the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation to employ 260 new workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The motion uses the words 'completely absent', and 'completely absent' describes what really has been a lack of a meaningful or coherent plan to properly listen over the last nine years of the coalition government. No clear attempt to build capacity in the community is evidenced—to be able to understand and to empower them to contribute to the conversations about solutions. It was more of the same paternalistic government-knows-best policies and packages, an approach which successive
           <i>
            Closing the gap
           </i>
           reports have shown to have been largely ineffective. This is what the Uluru statement speaks directly to. This is why our government has committed to providing an opportunity for voters to have their say on a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament. The Australian public did not accept that proposal, even where it had overwhelming support from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We accept the outcome of the referendum. We continue now with renewed vigour to work at the challenge of closing the gap.
          </p>
          <p>
           Following the referendum, Minister Burney has continued to engage in conversations with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           nationwide, gaining further insights into how best to have that voice heard in the absence of the structure proposed in the referendum. The government's commitment to collaborating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities remains steadfast, recognising the importance of their perspectives and their involvement. The priorities reiterated consistently by community and representative bodies are health, jobs, education, housing and justice. I attended the 16th anniversary celebration of the national apology during the last sitting. At that event, we were challenged by the speakers to do better. On the same day, Minister Burney and the Prime Minister recommitted the government to the task with a fresh approach entailing a focus on self-determination and the building of capacity at the community level.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government's tenets are formal partnerships and shared decision-making, building the community controlled sector, transforming government organisations so that they work for everyone and shared access to data and information to better support that work. I think we can all agree that the status quo is unacceptable. The government's approach will be informed by First Nations voices. The attitude of government-knows-best without that input has demonstrably failed over the past decade. At its base, closing the gap is about addressing entrenched inequality. We can do better, and this government is committed to doing better. I look forward to the constructive contributions of the member for Durack and this House.

            The cashless debit card was removed in Ceduna in November 2022. Minister Rishworth has accused the coalition of playing politics over its latest allegations about lawlessness in Ceduna. She says, 'There is no evidence or data the cashless debit card has worked, and Mr Ramsey's comments are misleading.' I've had more than 30 letters, mostly from Ceduna businesses, and the following are excerpts from them.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I witnessed eight women fighting in front of the duty, pulling hair and carrying on like animals. I saw a tourist pull up, and he had his head under the tarp of his boat, and an Aboriginal man came up and started urinating on the side of his car. One of the worst incidents was a child being flogged for wanting money. This was heartbreaking. There was an Indigenous male repeatedly kicking and punching an Indigenous female in the head and body at 5.30 in the afternoon, with many tourists and locals, including children, witnessing this horrific event.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every morning, when I arrive at work, the first job is to walk around and assess the damage to the premises and customers' vehicles stored on the premises. I feel, as does everyone, an expectation and rights to feel safe to walk in our community streets, especially in daylight hours. At the moment, this is not the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            My children witnessed an attack on a group of people with an axe in front of my residence, with multiple police and ambulance officers turning up after the incident. It felt like a scene from a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max" rel="nofollow">

            movie. People are too scared to come shopping due to the numerous violent fights occurring in the vicinity daily; they're scared of becoming victims themselves. We had our windows smashed while I was standing inside the shop, even knowing the person who committed the crime but not even sure that they were charged.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alcohol and drug misuse are a major concern; defecating, urinating, vomiting, yelling, swearing, arguing, verbal abuse, threats, fighting, alcohol induced sleeping, drinking alcohol, intimidation and threatening people walking by. I have to lock myself in our office when working alone due to concerns about my safety, and being unable to get in my car in the evening at times. A riot: more than 50 people involved, with people being assaulted, verbally abused and knocked out in the street. Only three police in attendance, completely outnumbered and not safe. Our gate kicked in, bike stolen, scooter stolen. I've had an Indigenous lady knocking on our door at midnight having been burnt and saying someone was trying to rape her. Two break-ins in the last three months, significant verbal abuse from people that are drunk and on drugs. Most days, we are cleaning up rubbish—paper cups from where the Red Cross give out free tea and coffee to their clients in abundance and food tins, clothing, empty drink containers. It feels wrong, having to lock ourselves in every day. Please do not ignore this email or put it in the too-hard basket. This is a very real problem and it needs urgent attention.

            On shoplifting: shoplifters being asked to hand over attempted stolen products, then spiking and biting them before handing them over so the products then need to be destroyed. People walking in grab products off the shelf and walk out laughing. The staff no longer attempts to stop it as their vehicles are badly damaged in retaliation. They just write down the items for the insurance purposes.'

            These comments are on the card. 'Since the Indue card was discontinued, things have got a lot worse. I'm sure if it was reinstated there would be a huge difference. Since the loss of the card, I've observed a noticeable increase in such bad behaviour. Customers that would have qualified for the Indue card are now unable to access enough funds to have their vehicles repaired. While the Indue card was active, a massive improvement in our central business district; antisocial behaviour was reduced significantly and customers on the card were able to pay their accounts promptly. The loss of the card affects my business. The kids are not wearing clean, suitable clothing; they don't have shoes on, they don't get Christmas presents and our theft rate has gone up. People with no money have no option other than to steal.

            The removal of the Indue card had a massive impact on Ceduna township, it was like flicking a switch and the antisocial behaviour escalated immediately. Since the Indue card ceased, we have seen a rapid decline in our business due to escalating violence and verbal abuse.'

            And on loss of faith: 'We've had a number of businesses thinking about shutting down, with one hairdresser already calling it quits and shutting down due to the issues. There will be a number of others if things don't improve soon.'

            I've asked the minister, in writing, to come to Ceduna unannounced. I'm willing to accompany her when we go and discuss these issues with the more than 30 businesses and people that have contacted me from Ceduna.

             I acknowledge that it has been interesting to sit here and listen to the member for Durack, who, like me, probably has one of the largest seats in this federal parliament. My seat of Lingiari is 1.1 million square kilometres. It covers 76 remote communities and 500 homelands in the

             and Ceduna to have a look at how we get better solutions and outcomes for people. A lot of these issues have been long-term and communities have struggled for a long time with coming up with solutions. But when you do have communities that have solutions to a lot of these problems, often it needs government to listen to what those solutions are. For too long we have seen complete deafness or ignorance on the side of governments in terms of looking at what the solutions are.
