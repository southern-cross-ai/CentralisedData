        On Tuesday, 7 June I attended a service at the Salisbury War Memorial to recognise military working dogs. On the day, a belgian shepherd named Ankcon and his handler, Paul Keily, laid a wreath at the memorial, as they had done at the Anzac service earlier this year. Military dogs and their handlers from the

        , Army, Navy and police were also at the service. I understand a similar service was held at the

        . The work of our military dogs has been, and continues to be, just as important and equally dangerous. The date 7 June was chosen to recognise the work of our military dogs and their handlers because it marks the anniversary of the deaths of explosives detection dog handler Sapper Darren Smith and his dog, Herbie. Both were killed after having detected a remotely controlled explosive device.

        Five military dogs have now been killed in Afghanistan since they were first deployed in 2005. Military dogs provide invaluable service to our defence forces. The discipline and precision of the dogs on parade at the Salisbury service was a credit to their handlers. The service was a fitting recognition of them.
