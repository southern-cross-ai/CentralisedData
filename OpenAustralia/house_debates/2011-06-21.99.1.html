        Irrespective of the tactics tonight, this government will not drown out the voice of the silent majority of my electorate. The increase in the luxury car tax has put a burden on my growers and graziers, whose only accessible way to town is by four-wheel drive. The impost of the flood levy announced on 27 January is expected to raise $1.8 billion, and all of that is coming out of the pockets of my mums and dads. The tax increase on company cars announced on Tuesday, 10 May is expected to raise over $970 million on the forward estimates. That will come out of Australia's pockets. The abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset announced on Tuesday, 10 May is expected to raise $365 million over the forward estimates.

          Order! The member for Chifley will resume his seat. Before I proceed on the adjournment debate, I would ask those who are responsible for the tactics within this chamber on both sides to reflect on today's activities. When I have people who are whips for their political parties coming in to indicate to me that the tactic of calling quorums by either side would continue for weeks of parliamentary sittings, I think things have gone a bit too far. I am told that people have forgotten where they are when quorums are being called and all sorts of things that have been said across the chamber that people should regret. At a time when we have in the gallery, as I understand, representatives of local government, a sphere of government that seeks full recognition, I would hope and expect that they think that our behaviour, as the national parliament, should be better. I am at a loss to understand why events of over 24 hours ago can be used for irritating, disorderly tactics of quorum calling, but that does not justify the events that have happened also during the adjournment.
         </p>
         <p>
          The question is that the House do now adjourn. The member for Chifley has the call and he will be heard in silence.
