       <p>
        Earlier today,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        returned to her home port of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Garden Island
        </a>
        for the last time. For 34 years, HMAS
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        and her crew have served our country with the distinction. I should particularly note that back in 1999
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        was deployed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        and subsequently made 11 trips to East Timor in support of our operations there and in support of the freedom of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
         East Timorese
        </a>
        people. Most recently the
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        supported the relief mission to Vanuatu following the devastation of Cyclone Pam.
       </p>
       <p>
        Back in 1941, when Australian soldiers were besieged in Tobruk, it was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Navy
        </a>
        that were the garrison's link to the outside world. The efforts of our Navy and the Royal Navy provided what was then known as the Tobruk ferry. HMAS
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        has lived up to its namesake. The
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        and her company have more than lived up to the ship's motto, 'Faithful and Strong'. As her commander made clear today, while the Navy is losing the
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        , the Navy is certainly not losing that capacity, with the HMAS
        <i>
         Canberra
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Adelaide
        </i>
        either in service or shortly coming into service. Madam Speaker, HMAS
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        , as you would well know, has fulfilled her mission, and a grateful nation says thank you.

         I join the Prime Minister in saluting the service of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Tobruk
         </i>
         and all who sailed in her. Named for the siege of
         <i>
          Tobruk
         </i>
         , a famous example of Australian courage and resourcefulness in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         , over 34 years the HMAS
         <i>
          Tobruk
         </i>
         gave fine military and humanitarian service to Australia and our region. A great leader of our country,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chifley" rel="nofollow">
          Ben Chifley
         </a>
         , famously said our duty was to work for 'the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand'. The
         <i>
          Tobruk
         </i>
         helped Australia do just that. She was there to support Australia's leadership in Timor. She offered assistance to the people of Vanuatu rebuilding after a devastating cyclone. She was proudly an Australian-made warship, from the Carrington Slipways. She has done her duty faithfully and well, and we thank her.

          I would like to add my own remarks on
          <i>
           Tobruk
          </i>
          's service. It was scheduled to be retired nearly 20 years ago, and then-Minister McLachlan and I, with some good Naval persuasion, decided we could not do without her, and so it is with a sense of sadness that I see her being paid off now.
