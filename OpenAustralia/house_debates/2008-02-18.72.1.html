        , the University of Tasmania and Horticulture Australia Ltd. This model, which has been dubbed ‘the Russell model’, was delivered by the National Primary Industry Centre for Science Education or PICSE for short. This will provide a pathway to attract young people into science through university and then into science careers in primary industry. This will create future leaders and innovators, will add real value and will provide an essential science skills and knowledge base to rural and regional Australia, as well as maintain Australia’s international competitiveness. This model, the Russell model, was initiated in the electorate of Braddon in 1998, when I had the great privilege of first being elected to this House. Tomorrow I will be meeting with its innovative initiator, Dr Russell, and some of his fellow collaborators to try and advance this very exciting project, which will assist in developing our primary industries.

        As you would be well aware, Mr Speaker, with your great interest in science and the environment, student enrolments in science at both secondary and tertiary level are declining, unfortunately, at the same time that industry demand for science professionals is increasing. These facts are responsible for a growing shortfall in science professionals to meet industry, research and postgraduate demand. Given the time lag of at least five years between year 12 and students exiting university, it is imperative that the PICSE program commence in 2008 in order to have an impact on the serious skills shortages in 2012, when DEST anticipates a 35 per cent shortfall of science graduates.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very pleased today by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        mentioning his Skills in Australia legislation, which Labor proffered in the election and will bring forward soon in legislation. I think this fits absolutely magnificently into that and also into our education revolution legislation and policies, so well advanced by the Deputy Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        PICSE will provide a successful and proven strategy for universities, primary industries, research and development corporations, state government departments,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
         DAFF
        </a>
        , DOTARS and DEST to work collaboratively to support a national solution through the delivery of a tested model that integrates science class activities, teachers’ professional development, production of teaching resources, student camps and a student industry placement program with local science based industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        An investment of $2.48 million is required to establish PICSE in 2008. It is proposed that this will be shared by six activity centres, with local universities and local industries providing $100,000 to $150,000 each to a total of $0.92 million, with an investment from national industry partners of $0.30 million and federal government assistance of $1.25 million. By 2012 this level of investment will lift to $1.84 million from 14 activity centres, with $1.26 million from national industry partners and $1.26 million from the federal government, totalling $4.35 million annually to develop science in our primary industries which are so badly needed both now and into the future. I heartily commend this program, begun in Braddon in 1998, both to this government and to all members in this House because I know that it will certainly aid their regional communities and primary industry in particular.
