        May I take this opportunity to advocate, on behalf of the local community, for a number of funding priorities within my electorate of Moore—in particular, in the areas of Financial Assistance Grants to local government, building community facilities, aged care and health. As part of the process, submissions will be carefully assessed for inclusion in the upcoming federal budget. Both capital funding and recurrent funding is required to deliver improved services and facilities for my local residents. The upcoming federal budget will be framed in the context of challenging economic conditions, with natural disasters, such as the recent bushfires and floods, and international crises, such as the coronavirus, negatively affecting Australia's economy. These events are having a detrimental effect on our domestic economy, which necessitates spending restraint and responsible economic management for the long-term benefit of our nation. It is in this austere context that the budget will be framed.

        totalled $5,595,749, which greatly assisted the city to provide essential services to ratepayers, without significant increases in rates. It is essential that this level of funding is maintained and increased to offset the effects of inflation and rising municipal costs. By partnering with the City of Joondalup the Commonwealth is able to deliver community facilities through federal funding contributions for capital works. The local priorities include new premises for the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club, the redevelopment of Heathridge Park to accommodate the

In addition, a strong case can be made for a federal contribution towards the master plan upgrades at Percy Doyle Reserve for Sorrento Bowling Club, and facility upgrades at

        Access to age care services continues to be a key priority within my electorate, with, currently, a high level of unmet demand and long waiting times for elderly residents. An increase in aged care funding for additional places is one of the most important considerations for the upcoming budget. As at 30 June 2019, there were 444 residential aged care places funded in my electorate, with a further 16 short-term restorative care places and 121 transition care places, bringing the total number to 581 places. However, this is still insufficient to meet demand. Local families require improved access to aged care services and facilities to meet their individual care needs and financial circumstances. Forward planning is required in order to have sufficient resources available to meet future aged care requirements in our community. I call upon the government to increase the available funding in the budget for residential aged and home care services for our senior services.

        In terms of medical services, the federal government has delivered on its funding commitment of $158 million towards the Joondalup hospital expansion, due to commence later this year. Demand for medical services in Joondalup continues to grow, as our regional city services the wider northern coastal corridor, with long waiting times. Recurrent funding of Medicare services continues to be a growing area of expenditure in the budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of constituents have contacted me in relation to expanding federal subsidies to cover reimbursement for a greater range of out-of-pocket medical expenses. I forwarded these proposals to the Minister for Health for evaluation and consideration as part of the budget process. Under the Morrison Liberal government the budget continues to subsidise access to a wider range of imaging and diagnostic services, pharmaceutical benefits and professional consultations. This year subsidised access to medical devices, such as continuous glucose monitors for diabetics, has been expanded to cover a wider range of eligible patients, and a wider range of medications has been added to the

        . As a strong advocate for expanding the provision of medical services within the City of Joondalup, I support an increase in medical funding within the budget. I look forward to participating—
