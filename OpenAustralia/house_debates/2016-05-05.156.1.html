       <p>
        In the Hindmarsh electorate, I am pleased to be able to work with local community groups regularly, whether it be attending their events or providing support through federal government programs and sponsorships. For Hindmarsh, the Stronger Communities Program has been extremely helpful in providing assistance to clubs and organisations looking to improve facilities and amenities for the benefit of their members and the wider community. I am always visiting the local groups in the electorate to meet the members, present Australian volunteer recognition certificates and witness firsthand the federal funding that is helping to grow clubs and organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to speak about a few of these major initiatives. The Edwardstown Bowling Club is one group that I have been pleased to see benefit from the Stronger Communities Program in round one, receiving over $9,000 to support the upgrade of the current lights on the green, allowing members to play well into the evening, especially in winter. I have also supported the bowling club with a ramp so that some of their members with movement challenges can reach the green and play to the best of their ability. That disabled access ramp is proving a great win for the local club. On a broader scale, the redevelopment of the Edwardstown sport complex is something that I have worked hard on with local councillors and others to try to get a good outcome for the local community and have better facilities in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Adelaide Sailing Club has received nearly $10,000 to upgrade its outdoor amenities. Having attended the sailing club opening days for a number of years, I can see that it is a great place for the club members and others in the community to get involved, whether it be sailing or just enjoying a fine meal down there by the water.

         West Beach
        </a>
        Surf Life Saving Club is a club I have a lot of familiarity with. It is just down the road and is where my children go to engage in the Nippers program. It is receiving some federal funding which will help the club patrol the beach for many years to come, ensuring that its emergency service products remain safe and in good order. The West Beach Surf Life Saving Club does a great job on many fronts. The Pink Swim for the Breast Cancer Foundation is just one of those.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other clubs that have been supported include the Glenelg Lacrosse Club—and I congratulate

        and his team on the lighting upgrade at Barratt Reserve at West Beach—and the Glenelg Brass Band, who I saw on the weekend. Bob Owen does a great job of ensuring that they have the necessary upgrades to their musical instruments—which is great—and they had many members of the public there supporting them on a Sunday afternoon.

       </p>
       <p>
        Others to receive funding include the Glenelg Bowling Club, for a kitchen upgrade; the Coptic orthodox church, for the insulation of its community hall; and the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lakes" rel="nofollow">

         South Australian Amateur Football League
        </a>
        ; Fulham United Football Club, for another lighting upgrade for their facilities; and the soccer clubs around the districts, which are expanding in great numbers with more young girls, in particular, and young boys playing. They need support to upgrade their facilities. As we know, sporting clubs and registrations are becoming more expensive, so it is great that the federal government can get behind those clubs and help support them to improve their facilities. The Messinian Association of South Australia Inc. and the soccer club that plays at King's Reserve at Thebarton are also receiving an upgrade to their kitchen.
       </p>
       <p>
        So it is a great program, and there are so many great local organisations that are receiving benefits. They have worked hard. They have worked well with me and my independent panel to determine who receives support. I congratulate them all for the fine work they do on behalf of the community and wish them all the best for their work in the future.
