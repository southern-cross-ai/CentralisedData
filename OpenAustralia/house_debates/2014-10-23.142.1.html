       <p>
        I rise today to speak in support of an application for federal funding made by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Shire
        </a>
        Council in my electorate of Richmond. At the Tweed council's October meeting, held last week, they resolved to nominate the Kingscliff Foreshore Master Plan as their application for financial assistance to the government's National Stronger Regions Fund. I strongly request that the government look favourably at this application and fund this. Make no mistake about it: this is an outstanding project and it will significantly add to the economic growth of Kingscliff, the Tweed Coast and, indeed, the entire Tweed Shire. I also strongly commend the council for their decision to submit this application for a very worthy project. In particular, I would like to recognise the vision and enthusiasm of Mayor Gary Bagnall and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his recent election as mayor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kingscliff is a thriving coastal village on the New South Wales North Coast and this prime tourist location will be greatly enhanced with the completion of this fantastic project. The master plan includes a three-stage, $20.4 million upgrade to the Kingscliff foreshore to, firstly, construct a sea wall to protect the beach and nearby facilities and replenish sand supplies on the beach; secondly, complete a major upgrade of the Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park; and, thirdly, create the Kingscliff central park, including the refurbishment of the Kingscliff amenities hall. All of these massive improvements will create a boost to the local tourism industry, which is of course the centre of our economy on the New South Wales North Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project has a wide variety of benefits. It guarantees security for the Kingscliff foreshore; it provides new open space; it enhances and sustains the profitability of the holiday park; it protects the main commercial precinct and the many shops fronting the foreshore; and it will assist in maintaining the beach and foreshore, which are a major economic driver and tourism attraction of the area. It also creates a more functional community centre in the middle of town and creates additional parking capacity to support local businesses and the foreshore park.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the government announced earlier this month that applications were open for the first round of grants through their National Stronger Regions Fund, and I understand that the fund will provide dollar-for-dollar assistance for the construction of new infrastructure or the upgrade of existing infrastructure which brings sustainable economic benefits. I am advised that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Shire Council
        </a>
        's application meets all the criteria required, and it is shovel ready. For this project the council are seeking federal funding of nearly $10 million to match their contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a project that the government must fund. Its completion is vitally important for our growing economy. The project provides such an array of benefits to really improve this area. As I said, the master plan will boost economic activity and employment during its construction, and there is widespread community support for this project. I note that the Kingscliff &amp; District Chamber of Commerce president, Jayne Henry, has said the application and master plan were 'a supreme priority' for her business group. Jayne went on to say:
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Jayne for her advocacy on this program, on this particular project, and for others relating to the Kingscliff area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, the general manager of the Kingscliff Beach Bowls Club, Phill Kelley, has said:
       </p>
       <p>
        As a federal MP I am very proud to have worked with my community and represented their concerns here in the federal parliament. This has resulted in more than $1.5 billion in federal funding for my electorate. I will list some of those great achievements that we have got together through working with the community: $7 million for the South Tweed

       </p>
       <p>
        Our community has a very proud record of working together to secure federal funding, working together with all levels of government, all community groups and all business chambers to get great results. I have outlined some of those fantastic results to you today, and I call on the government now to commit funds to this great project that I have spoken about: the Kingscliff Foreshore Master Plan. It is vitally important for the future growth of our area around Kingscliff and the Tweed Shire on the New South Wales North Coast.
