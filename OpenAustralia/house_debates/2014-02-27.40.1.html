       <p>
        I rise today to highlight concerns raised by my constituents about the government’s plan to introduce a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        tax—a new tax that will hit those who can least afford it the hardest: families with children, older people and those most vulnerable in our community. On the back of this government’s already shocking record of cuts to jobs and services, this new GP tax will blow the household budgets of thousands of Newcastle families. Likewise, age pensioners, who are already worried about the Abbott government’s refusal to rule out future cuts to their pension, are telling me they cannot afford the $6 tax to visit their GP. Imposing an up-front tax of $6 for every visit to the GP will cost Novocastrians an extra $3.9 million per year for their medical care.
       </p>

        The people of Newcastle support Medicare and the principle that all Australians should have equal access to health care. They are worried about this government's move to create a two-tiered health system: one for the haves and one for the have nots. This government made an election commitment to not cut spending to health. Yet the health minister this week flagged that cuts are on the way. As Karen Howard, Chair of the Hunter Medicare Local, wrote this week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … any considered examination of the health system will confirm what has been consistently demonstrated in international studies for more than a decade: the sustainability of any health system is improved by strengthening primary healthcare.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to strengthen our primary health care, and that starts with GPs. Do not make it harder for people by introducing this new tax.
