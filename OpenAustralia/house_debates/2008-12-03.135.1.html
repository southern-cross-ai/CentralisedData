        and his wife, Rivkah, both of whom were murdered there. Terrible reports in various international papers today indicate that some of the victims were tortured before they were killed. These are very hard things to face up to, but they have to be faced because they are well known in the international press. This religious young couple were very peaceful and had dedicated themselves to serving the tiny Jewish community in Mumbai and helping people who were suffering from drug addiction and poverty. They took in Israeli backpackers and Jewish visitors and treated them with uplifting spiritual experiences. Their Chabad house, their synagogue, served as an island of yiddishkeit for Jewish people travelling through Mumbai and through India. Any visitor could stay and attend free, kosher food was offered and visitors could participate in a service over Shabbat. Rabbi Gavriel and Rebbetzin Rivkah represented the ultimate in human kindness. Their presence in Mumbai and on earth will be sadly missed.

        Also killed in the Chabad house were Yocheved Orpaz, Rabbi Aryeh Leibish Teitelbaum and Rabbi Bentzion Chroman. Rabbi Teitelbaum was murdered as he was studying a book of Jewish learning in the synagogue. He was found slumped over an open Talmud. Norma Shvarzblat-Rabinovich was also killed in those terrible events. It is important to remember the names of all of these individuals. As
