        I would like to do something odd and join with the member for Canberra—and I think today we have also had the member for Perth, the member for Makin and the member for Bendigo—and invite the health minister to come and visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        superclinics. So I am going to join with the members opposite and invite the Minister for Health to come and visit the GP superclinic in my electorate, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might want to come and visit, too. But of course we would just be visiting an empty field, because the clinic has been promised in two elections, but never delivered. Land has not really been allocated, and it cannot receive a patient. So as it seems our Labor members are standing up and talking up the GP superclinic program, I would invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the health minister to come and visit and see how many patients are actually being seen in this empty field.

        I notice the member for Herbert is

        . I think that in Herbert there is actually a GP superclinic that cost $6 million. It has been built, it has a very fancy sign outside, but it has not actually seen a patient.

        I think the member for Capricornia has also had a superclinic promised at one point, but it has not been delivered.

        And we have another one over here—the member for Durack—have you got patients being seen in yours?

          No—no patients yet; just promise. I love the Labor Party's hypocrisy—they are happy to stand up and make announcements and have photo opportunities, but when it comes to actually putting taxpayers' money into service delivery and improving healthcare outcomes for patients, they are not so good on that side. So I am proud to be part of a team that is delivering better healthcare outcomes.
