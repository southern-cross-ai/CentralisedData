       Live Animal Exports

      <p class="italic">
       Dear Mr Murphy
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 10 June 2011 about a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding live animal exports from Australia to the Middle East. I regret the delay in responding.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Middle East region is a vital group of live export markets for Australia. High standards of animal welfare throughout the entire live export chain including post arrival are essential for long term trade sustainability.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government shares the Australian community's concerns about the abuse of animals and is taking action to ensure exporters can assure the Government that cattle, sheep and goats will be managed through the supply chain in accordance with international animal welfare standards.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and. Forestry, has asked Mr Bill Farmer AO to undertake an investigation examining the whole live animal export supply chain, from paddock, to export and up to and including the point of slaughter, for all markets that receive Australian livestock. The review will support greater transparency across our export markets, provide recommendations on reforming the trade, and will contribute to the design and application of new safeguards for animal welfare.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Industry-Government Working Group on Live Sheep and Goat Exports has been established in addition to the Industry-Government Working Group on Live Cattle. The working groups will focus on traceability and supply chain assurances for all live cattle, sheep and goat exports.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Both Industry-Government Working Groups will be reporting to the Government at around the same time as the independent review into Australia's livestock export trade (the Farmer Review) at the end of August 2011. This will provide the Government with comprehensive information for considering the future policy direction for live animal exports.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention.
      </p>
