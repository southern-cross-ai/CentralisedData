       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to some outstanding members of the community in my electorate of Makin, the first of these five people being Mr Tom Javor. Tom has lived in the local area since 1966. Mr Javor dedicated 20 years of his life to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Army Reserve
        </a>
        , matching the rank of warrant officer. Tom studied economics at university and has worked in a diverse range of industries over many years. Tom also dedicates a lot of his time to his local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        as a secretary and newsletter editor. Tom Javor is standing as the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Playford. The issues he is standing for are: reinforcing the importance of law and order in the community, encouraging community based and other crime prevention programs, improving local roads and traffic infrastructure, paying special attention to the needs of children, families and the elderly, and he will fight for cheaper electricity for our community. I commend and thank Tom Javor for his work and what he is standing for.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Pat Trainor. Mr Pat Trainor has lived in the local area for most of his life, completing his high schooling at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_East" rel="nofollow">
         Salisbury East
        </a>
        High School. Pat has dedicated a lot of his life to the local community. He is involved in local sporting clubs and various other community organisations, including being a current member of our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        . Pat is very passionate about the youth in our community. He is currently a member of the board of the In 2 Life program, a charity that runs mentoring programs to reduce suicide amongst young people. He is also a trustee of Viva South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pat is currently working as a civil engineer, consulting industry and the corporate sector. Pat was also the local pastor in the north-eastern area, and prior to that worked as a construction engineer and project manager. Pat has studied at university and currently holds a degree in civil engineering and a masters degree in conflict management. Pat also served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army Reserve
        </a>
        for eight years. As Pat Trainor is standing as the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Florey, the issues that he is standing for and fighting for include: a reduction in stamp duty on land tax, a reduction in the price of essential services like electricity, raising the literacy level of primary school students and reducing third generation unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Stephen Ernst. Stephen is also heavily involved with our local community, having lived here for 12 years and living currently in Salisbury East with his wife and three children. As a training coordinator and a former long-serving police officer, Stephen has a strong commitment to his local community, which is evident through his involvement with local sporting clubs, resident and service clubs such as chairing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Tree_Gully" rel="nofollow">
         Tea Tree Gully
        </a>
        Carols. Stephen is a founding member of the Golden Grove Community Association, which is committed to providing community help for local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Stephen Ernst is standing as the Liberal candidate in the seat of Wright, the issues that he is standing for are: fighting for family and community values, creating opportunities for our children, continuing to pressure the government for an effective police station, supporting older people in our community and working with small businesses to help them grow. I commend and thank Stephen Ernst for his work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another person I would like to pay tribute to is Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Watts" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Watts
        </a>
        . Ron has both lived and worked in the northern suburbs since moving from Sydney in 1973. He is heavily involved in our local community, currently employed as the manager of the Northern Business Enterprise Centre. Ron also has qualifications in textile technology. He is an associate fellow of the Australian Marketing Institute, sales and marketing and business management. Ron was awarded national business enterprise manager of 2005. Ron was Elizabeth Citizen of the Year in 1989 for his work in youth employment and training. His community involvement also includes former president of the Elizabeth Chamber of Commerce; he was the founding chairman of the Elizabeth and Munna Para SkillShare; he has 20 years service with local Rotary clubs including Munna Para, Elizabeth and Playford; he is a former local councillor; and he is a member of the Playford-Salisbury Sustainable Region Advisory Committee just to name a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend and thank Ron for his work and what he is standing for in our community. As Ron Watts is standing as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Little Para, these are some of the things he stands for: child care, supportive aged care available locally, engagement of young people in self-determining activities, promoting community values, greater assistance with self-funded retirees and a better mental health system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Mark Osterstock. Mark is another outstanding member of our local community. He has been in the north-east for more than 15 years. Mark served as a non-commissioned officer in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        for eight years and received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Service Medal
        </a>
        for service in South-East Asia. He has been a police officer for 15 years and a police prosecutor for three years at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Hill" rel="nofollow">
