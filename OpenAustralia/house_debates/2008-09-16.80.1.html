        I rise today to talk about someone whom it has been my great privilege to know and work alongside in resolving a longstanding issue. The person I would like to talk about is Mr William Akell—Bill or, more colloquially, ‘Yank’—who was one of the 108-strong
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Company" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        which defeated a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">
         North Vietnamese
        </a>
        force of between 1,500 and 2,500 troops at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        . When I stop to think about that—a battle between 108 men and up to 2,500 men, fought on foreign soil in a foreign climate—it is a miracle that anyone in Delta Company actually survived. To say that it was an act of courage and determination would be an understatement.
       </p>
       <p>
        A longstanding concern for the men who fought that battle has been the issue of military medals and the recognition that they are entitled to be awarded and wear the Vietnamese citation. I am very proud to be part of a government that has actually rectified this issue.

        </a>
        —and Platoon Commanders Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall have been offered the Medal for Gallantry. This restores the original award recommendations by the commanding officers and accepts that the intention was to award Sabben and Kendall higher honours. The strength of D Company 6RAR in Vietnam on 18 August has also received approval to wear the former Republic of Vietnam’s

        with Palm Unit Citation Emblem. Other measures have included the referral of other unresolved concerns regarding individual awards for Long Tan to the independent Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very proud to be part of a government that understands the significance of the Vietnamese citations and the issue of military medals for those men who have now been offered them. I am very proud to be part of a government that considers the historical context of a decision and is not afraid to overturn the decisions that were made within that context.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first spoke on this matter in the House in 2002 and knew then that it was an issue that needed to be resolved. It had to take a change of government, but finally this matter can be laid to rest and we can take one more step towards helping to heal the emotional wounds of Vietnam veterans who were treated so badly on their return from service. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge my colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Edwards" rel="nofollow">

        , a Vietnam veteran and the former member for Cowan, who worked tirelessly for the proper recognition of these men. He is sorely missed in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final word needs to go to Bill Akell. I feel so honoured to have assisted in a small way toward something that is so meaningful. I hold the deepest respect for you and your family, for the energy and commitment you have shown—not just for yourself but for all the men from Delta Company. I have learned a great deal from you—not just about battles and wars and medals but also about personal strength and character—and I will always be grateful for the opportunity to have been some help.
