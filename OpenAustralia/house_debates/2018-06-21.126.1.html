       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian honours system is a vital part of our social fabric. Honours help define, encourage and reinforce our national aspirations, ideals and standards by identifying those among us who make an outstanding contribution to our society. The recipients of Australian honours and awards are very special men and women whose actions have set them apart and enriched our communityâ€”
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the following residents from my community for their outstanding service.

His service to community groups has spanned almost 40 years. I would also like to recognise Dene's wife, Dianne, who was always by his side until she passed away 12 months ago. She would have been so proud of him. I know that Dene's brother, Neville, who is also a good friend of mine, would be proud as well. Congratulations to all the 2018 Queen's Birthday honours recipients from my electorate of Boothby.
