        My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of reports of anticompetitive behaviour by some petrol stations in recent days? What is the government doing to ensure consumers are not being ripped off at the petrol pump over this Easter long weekend?

         I thank the member for his question. This Easter will be the first time that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         has had formal power to monitor petrol prices—the very first time the ACCC has had these formal powers. It is very important, because there has been some alleged activity by some petrol stations over the last few days. There are serious allegations that consumers are driving into petrol stations that are advertising cheaper unleaded prices only to find that the pumps are out of order and that they are forced to buy more expensive petrol. I can report to the House that over recent days almost 50 inspectors from the ACCC and state governments have been out there to ensure that activity such as that is not occurring and there will be inspectors on the beat over the Easter period. We now have a watchdog with teeth, and they will be out there. Today I urge Australians who feel they are being ripped off by any of the practices that were mentioned before to call the ACCC on 1300302502.
        </p>

         Those opposite might think that financial pressure on Australian families is a laughing matter. Could you have a better example of a group of people who are more out of touch than those over there? This is the crew who have a spokesman for Treasury who said when he was questioned about the highest inflation in 16 years, ‘Mission accomplished.’ He was proud of it. What did he say when productivity hit zero? He said: ‘Don’t worry. Mission accomplished.’ What did he say when there were eight interest rate rises in three years? He said: ‘Don’t worry. Mission accomplished.’

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: we really want to hear what the Treasurer is saying. I ask that you ask him to speak into the microphone, because we actually cannot hear half of what he is saying over here.

            North Sydney

           raises one aspect of his ability to hear the Treasurer. Another aspect would be that he could only hear his own voice and those of his colleagues who are

            interjecting

           . So I am quite happy to ask the Treasurer to speak into the microphone if in fact those on my left are going to listen to him in silence.

            Competition in petrol retailing is a very serious issue. It goes to the core of the financial pressures on Australian families. I am sorry that the rabble over there does not appear to understand. This Easter, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            have said they will not hesitate to prosecute and fine those involved in misleading conduct, and that can happen now because this government has given the ACCC some teeth.
