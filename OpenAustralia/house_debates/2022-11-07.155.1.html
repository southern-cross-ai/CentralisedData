        There are over 40 million scouts worldwide. In my electorate of Longman there are six scout groups: Caboolture, Morayfield, Burpengary, Narangba, Woodford and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I'm a proud supporter of Scouts because their values are part of bringing up good, outstanding citizens, which benefits all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the attributes that scouts focus on are the importance of community involvement, self-confidence, accepting challenges, environmental issues, initiative and problem solving, honouring reward for effort by achieving badges and awards, leadership, planning and being prepared, independence, keeping things fun, taking risks and teamwork.

        For the venturer who's up for an extra challenge, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout
        </a>
        Award is the highest award in the venturer scout section and carries an outstanding reputation within scouting and the community. I think it will be called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Scout_Award" rel="nofollow">
         King's Scout Award
        </a>
        , moving forward. To gain the Queen's Scout award, the venturer must first achieve a venturer award standard in all 13 venturer award activities. They must then reach the Queen's Scout award standard in an activity area from each of leadership development, which includes outdoor activities, personal growth and community involvement. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Scout" rel="nofollow">
         Queen Scout
        </a>
        award aims to widen the interests and knowledge of venturer scouts, and encourage them to look wide. The award is designed to be challenging and encouraging for venturing scouts over a wide range of activities. To achieve this prodigious award, a venturer scout must be able to set a goal, plan progress towards that goal, organise themselves and others, and maintain a determination to overcome difficulties and complete a task. Completion of the Queen Scout award is a major milestone in a venturer scout's journey and carries an outstanding reputation. The award is approved by a venturer scout's peer at unit council level. This peer review aims to maintain good standards for the award and allow the venturer scout's efforts to be judged by those who understand their abilities and goals the best.

        Recently, I was pleased to attend the ceremony of Longman's latest recipient of the Queen Scout award, Alexander Bromley. I have known Alexander Bromley for a few years now and have watched him develop into a fine young man. I congratulate him and his proud parents, who were in attendance on this special day, David and Helen. I encourage anyone out there who has children who may have lost their way or who are looking for direction to join a Scout group, because the values and principles they will learn will hold them in good stead for the rest of their life.
