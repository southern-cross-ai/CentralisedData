        As the Australian and

        </a>
        economy transition, it is vital the government supports companies, where possible, to help jobs and economic growth. In recent months a number of local businesses in Hindmarsh have been the recipients of a federal government Industry Skills Fund grant to assist with the costs of training staff to take advantage of new growth opportunities. The government is committed to helping businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to grow and diversify their markets and create more local jobs. Under the Industry Skills Fund, eligible businesses can receive support to identify growth opportunities and advice on the skills and training their workforce needs to take advantage of these opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sorts of training projects that have been funded to date include helping employees to acquire new skills or upgrade their existing qualifications in areas as diverse as product design, inventory control, manufacturing techniques, management and marketing. I have enjoyed visiting a number of these businesses and learning more about their operations and plans to expand their workforce or help their employees with future training opportunities. The Industry Skills Fund is extremely important because the grants will help businesses grow.

        Some companies such as MIMP Computer Cables in Richmond, Torque Control Specialists in Edwardstown and Triple Point Calibrations in Welland have been fortunate to receive a number of grantsâ€”showing their dedication to continue to improve their workforce. In relation to MIMP, I congratulate Allan Aitchison, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , on the success his company has experienced. I have visited that company and been very impressed with the way it has grown and expanded into new markets across Australia, including groundbreaking projects like Adelaide's first internet-enabled buses, building a multicast mesh wireless network to make Darwin's streets safer and deploying a 480-kilometre wireless network in regional Queensland. MIMP has also worked to link up remote

        communities such as Arkaroola.

       <p>
        Established in 1985, they have provided and installed hundreds of communication systems throughout Australia. Major clients include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Zoo" rel="nofollow">

        , SA Heart, state and local government, Education, Health, Defence and large corporations. They have doubled their headcount to nearly 30 since 2013, driven by strong demand for their expertise. Like many other companies in Hindmarsh, they are also a good supporter of the local community by sponsoring organisations such as Anglicare and the Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        More recently I visited General Practice SA, which has received $40,000 towards a project called 'a healthy change' which is designed to expand services to clients in the primary healthcare service. The support provides training for 120 members across administration, management and leadership, sales and customer service. I also met

        , a footwear manufacturer, who received support for training for their employees. I encourage companies in Hindmarsh to look at the Industry Skills Fund because it offers some valuable support.
