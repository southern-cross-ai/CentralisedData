        </a>
        as the opposition advised the government that it would be referring other measures in that bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for inquiry. The amendments are necessary to ensure that these measures, which are of benefit to taxpayers, are passed before the end of the income year in order to remove doubt for taxpayers. Schedule 12 exempts from income tax the rent assistance paid to Austudy recipients, and schedule 13 exempts carer adjustment payments. Unless these amendments receive royal assent before 1 July 2008, payments made in the current income year will be included in the assessable income of recipients. Full details of the amendments are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

         The opposition supports the Senate’s approach to the

         </a>
         . They are essentially measures that we consider to be non-controversial and they were brought back to this House to be passed by the end of the financial year, as is appropriate. There have been some measures contained in tax bills that we believe should go through a fuller legislative process, and that is what we have moved to do in the Senate—although, as I said, the opposition support the approach that the Senate has taken on these particular amendments. We support them going through so that they can be enacted by the end of the financial year.
