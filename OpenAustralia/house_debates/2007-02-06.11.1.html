        My question again is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall his industry minister saying just six months ago: ‘I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate change’? Does the Prime Minister support this statement?

         It is not only remarks made by people in this parliament. There is a farmer I know who is sceptical about that connection as well! But we can debate. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the jury is still out on the degree of connection. What matters is what you do about it. It is not an academic debate; it is what you do about it. This government has done more to tackle both of these problems. The Leader of the Opposition is rejoicing in the fact that he has called a summit on climate change.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         remind you that the former minister for the environment, Senator Campbell, called about three summits on climate change. The most recent one was held back in 2003 and was attended by representatives of state governments and about 100 representatives of the business community from around Australia. So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to debate the connection between the two, let us by all means do so. There is obviously some connection. The degree of that is a matter of debate. What really matters is what you do about it. And the biggest response to the problem of drought in the Australian community at this time is what this government is proposing to do about the Murray-Darling Basin.

            —he is gradually becoming more supportive, and I welcome that, because I have always found him a man you can do business with if you get onto the right subject. I look forward to Thursday’s meeting in Canberra as being a great day for water security in this country.
