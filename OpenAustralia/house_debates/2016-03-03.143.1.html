        Housing is central to the Australian economy for a whole range of historical reasons, so today's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIS" rel="nofollow">
         BIS
        </a>
        Shrapnel report on Labor's negative gearing policy and economic data released today bring this to a point. Australia is now one of the fastest-growing economies in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        —almost as fast as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        , and almost twice as fast as Canada, the other great resource economy of comparable size. This shows that Australia, post
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
         GFC
        </a>
        , is keeping unemployment down, the way very few other economies are managing to do, and driving consumption, public spending and home-building in particular, keeping our economy moving, particularly in the southern states where we have seen 4.6 per cent growth year-on-year. Of course, what is most impressive is that, in the first quarter of the Turnbull government, we have had 0.6 per cent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        growth, taking our economy now to over $1.6 trillion. That really does show that Australia is right on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously we have low interest rates. The low Australian dollar is starting to yield dividends. Plus there is a wealth effect as Australians become a little more confident to loosen the purse strings and reduce some of their savings rates as they start to have a little more confidence to spend—and that is despite low wage growth, which is obviously a problem right across the developed world.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that does bring me to this point: what are the potential threats to that trajectory? And, hey, it is always easier when you are sitting in opposition and not releasing policies—and I have said a number of times: 'Congratulations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        for releasing a policy.' But right now he must feel very much like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" rel="nofollow">
         Donald Trump
        </a>
        without any cash, because here we have a situation where he has finally come out with a policy that everyone is listening to, but increasingly we are seeing that there are a lot of rough edges and barnacles on that policy. That is because there are really no easy answers in tax reform. I do really sense that it was rushed by Bill Shorten when he saw, two weeks ago, a political opportunity to come out with a big, bold policy. But there are so few in tax, and it is very wise to be very cautious.

        As BIS Shrapnel has emphasised overnight, renters, low-income households and young people are most at risk from changes to negative gearing.

         I know this does evoke some emotion from the other side, but look: you cannot simply rule out 90 per cent of sales from the negative gearing option and force 40 per cent of your investors into the remaining 10 per cent: new properties. It will cause extraordinary distortions, whether a bubble in the apartment market, or a drying up of rental opportunities; it is very hard to model the first-round and second-round effects. The first-round effects are that investors go and chase where they can get a reasonable deduction—that is, new properties. But do councils release land for new properties? Potentially, no faster than they currently do. Then you have the second-round effect that people know that it is just like the car that you drive out of the car yard: the minute the keys go in the ignition the value falls. Here the value falls because you know the next person will not get the negative gearing benefit from it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I urge the Labor Party one more time: you are in a world of pain; this will hang around your neck at the next election; please reconsider your policy for negative gearing, because right now, around this nation, you are walking around with a massive target on your back.
