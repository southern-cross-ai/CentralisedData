       <p>
        Two weeks ago, I was lucky enough to have the Assistant Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Reduction" rel="nofollow">
         Waste Reduction
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Environmental Management
        </a>
        , who is also the member for Brisbane, visit my electorate of Sturt. At the moment, happily, travel between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and Queensland is not restricted, so he was able to come to my electorate and visit some of the really important community environment projects which we have funded in my electorate of Sturt, as in all the electorates across the nation. We went to four very important projects. We started at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hill_Conservation_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Black Hill Conservation Park
        </a>
        , where we have provided funding for revegetation of ground coverings on what was old farmland and is part of the Hills Face in metropolitan Adelaide. We then went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreto_College" rel="nofollow">
         Loreto College
        </a>
        in Marryatville, where we're funding an excellent project with the year 11 biology class to create a seed bank of native seeds. They collect the seeds from along First Creek, which the school campus abuts, in the south of my electorate. We then went to Thorndon Park, which was the original reservoir for early European settlement in Adelaide. It's no longer a reservoir, but it is an important environmental asset in my electorate, and we've been funding a project there which is supporting a bird sanctuary. And then, finally, we went to Kensington Gardens Reserve, where we are creating a wetland to help filter stormwater that comes out of the suburban streets of Adelaide, to create great environmental outcomes in my electorate of Sturt.
