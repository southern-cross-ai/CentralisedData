        I had the privilege of visiting Ngaruki Gulgul Central School in Kariong recently to meet with a passionate principal, Andrea, and the teachers, and to introduce myself to some of the students who attend this school.

        Central School isn't like conventional schoolingâ€”it focuses on the interests of the student and uses this as its foundation for its educational programs. Students come from all over the

        , and it was clear from my visit, and from speaking with several students, that they prefer this method and are thriving in this format. I saw the outstanding metal and woodwork workshops that use to gain insight and skills of the carpentry and welding industries. Currently, they are working on a mobile sick-bay unit that will be able to provide medical assistance to students who are unwell. It's close to completion, and I can say the students have done a phenomenal job.

        I saw the school's brilliant hidden salon and its exceptional kitchen facilities. I was told that the students understandably love cooking classes and enjoy the opportunity of cooking with ingredients fresh from the school garden. It was impressive to see the beautiful edible bush foods growing in the garden and quite the delight to see a fig tree. Education is key to unlocking the doors in life, and I am confident that the NG Central School affording students opportunities that will enable them to reach their full potential.
