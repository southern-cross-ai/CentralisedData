        The establishment of this Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network with very wide terms of reference and a balanced membership demonstrates the government’s commitment to openness and transparency for the NBN. Unlike those opposite, who are determined to destroy the NBN under the guise of subjecting it to continuous political process and delay, the government supports genuine transparency. The establishment of this joint committee honours an undertaking given by the Prime Minister to Senator Xenophon during the passage of the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4479" rel="nofollow">
         Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010
        </a>
        late last year. It is a bill that delivers historic reforms to the telecommunications sector and improved consumer protections, one that the opposition obstructed for almost a year. The committee will compose seven government members and seven coalition members, drawn from each house, with a non-aligned member from each house. Any member or senator will be able to participate upon a resolution of either chamber. The government has agreed to support the Independent member for Lyne, Mr Oakeshott, should he nominate as the chair of the committee. This is an important part of transparency for the National Broadband Network. I commend this motion to the House.

             I have a question for the minister which he may be able to respond to. I know it not question time but it is a matter that could be addressed. It is not at all clear what resources this committee has available to it. We are dealing with a highly technical area of investment. We all accept that the members of the committee will give it their full diligence, and due care and attention will be paid to it—and it will apparently have an extraordinarily and recently clean-shaven chairman—nonetheless it would benefit greatly from some expert advice. A question the minister may care to address in the course of this debate is: what resources will the committee have? Subject to that and the start date of the committee—which we believe should be immediate and not put off to the middle of the year, which we understand is the government’s plan—we will support the committee.
