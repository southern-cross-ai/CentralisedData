        My question is to the Prime Minister. Sales of Australian-made prosecco now exceed 200 million annually, the result of the sector investing millions of dollars in the wine variety.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Union" rel="nofollow">
         The European Union
        </a>
        is now pushing for prosecco to be added to the list of food and drinks covered by geographical indication protection under the existing warrant agreement. What is the government doing to protect prosecco growers, including in my electorate of Mayo?

         I thank the member for Mayo her question and for her interest—shared by me and many others—in prosecco. It is indeed a fantastic product, much of which is grown, of course, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         .
        </p>

         We are currently negotiating with the European Union about a free trade agreement. As part of that, I met with the new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Italian Prime Minister
         </a>
         when we were together at the G20 meeting. It was the first meeting between an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Prime Minister
         </a>
         and the Italian Prime Minister for some period of time, and, at that bilateral meeting, I put forward Australia's interest in advancing the free trade agreement. We know, in terms of the agricultural sector in particular, that nations such as France and Italy have been very protective of particular labels of products. But the truth is that prosecco is a product which is produced not just in Italy, just like how roses are grown in lots of places around the world and they're still roses. We will advance Australia's national interest and negotiate in good faith with the European Union, and I'm hopeful that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          European Commission
         </a>
         will send their leaders—Ursula and Charles—out here next year. I've invited them to come out and meet with business, including in the agricultural sector, next year.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is much to be gained by a free trade agreement with Europe. When we think about the issues that have been raised with free trade agreements, they often relate to labour laws and relative cost. When you're talking about Europe, you don't have those issues. You can have a win-win agreement. That is why the entry fee for negotiating with Europe was a decent climate change policy, and that was indicated very clearly by the European Commission—not just the Italian Prime Minister but also the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">

         and the

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is now in a position whereby we're able to promote our national interest. We'll do so in good faith. We understand that these are challenges and that the starting position of our friends in Europe is different from ours, but we'll negotiate in good faith, and we'll consult with industries, including with the agricultural sector, as we do it.
