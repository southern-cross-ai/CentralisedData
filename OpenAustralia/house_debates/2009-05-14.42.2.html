        </a>
        has signed a heads of agreement formally indicating its intention to lease Anzac Park West from the Department of Finance and Deregulation following a fit-out of the building. Anzac Park West is a vacant heritage listed office building located within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Triangle" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Triangle
        </a>
        . It was built in 1966 and, along with Anzac Park East, is a portal building framing the vista between

        The base building refurbishment was completed in December 2006 within budget, at a cost of $48 million, prior to a planned fit-out by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        advised that Anzac Park West would no longer suit their accommodation needs due to unprecedented growth and they requested to be released from their lease commitment to the building. The fit-out works were not undertaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed fit-out for the Department of Defence will house approximately 900 staff and comprises base building modification works; office accommodation of approximately 15,000 square metres including a reception area, meeting rooms, offices and work points for the remaining staff; landscaping and external works including passive security measures, new pathways, car park rectification and planting of trees and plants; and base building works to the pavilion adjacent to Anzac Park West. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $45.5 million inclusive of
