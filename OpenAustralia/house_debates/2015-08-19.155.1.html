        Last Sunday I participated in the Cold Plunge for Those in Need, which was organised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Glenelg. I joined over 130 people who braved the cold, icy waters of Glenelg—luckily it was a beautiful winter's day. The event is for a great cause: raising money for Vinnies
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        and Uniting Care Glenelg, to support those experiencing homelessness in our community and those in need in Adelaide. As I have said in this place on previous occasions, almost 6,000 people are experiencing homelessness in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , and funds raised and blankets donated will go a long way to supporting these people in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and acknowledge the Rotary Club of Glenelg for organizing this terrific event. To event organiser, Jesse Cumming, presidents Peter Sage and Wayne Dyson, and to the many volunteers and members, well done on a fantastic event and initiative. I would also like to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Adelaide_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         West Adelaide Football Club
        </a>
        and

        . Both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        clubs were well represented, with players using this event as a great opportunity for a postmatch rehab to sooth those sore spots and support this great cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of community organisations also need to be thanked for their involvement on the day: Mary's Kitchen,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         St Andrews
        </a>
        by the Sea Uniting Church of Glenelg and, importantly, the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club that went out into the cold icy waters and made sure that we were safe and protected from any marine life out there that we would not want to come across.

        Another surf lifesaving club in my electorate that has had great success in the last year has been
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         West Beach
        </a>
        Surf Life Saving Club, winning the Overall Champion Club and Club of the Year at this year's Surf Life Saving SA Awards of Excellence. West Beach president Peter Zuill's leadership and contribution to surf lifesaving in South Australia was well recognised with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Volunteer of the Year
        </a>
        award. It was a great effort by the West Beach Club, which my children are involved in, so it gives me great pride to speak about my family's club like this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased to attend the annual awards of excellence on Saturday, 1 August at Surf Central in my electorate, where I joined lifesavers and volunteers from the clubs throughout SA to honour surf lifesaving members and their efforts in the last season. The evening was a wonderful celebration, and I would like to acknowledge the award winners from my electorate. They are: Thomas Hession, from Grange Surf Life Saving Club, winner of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Dale" rel="nofollow">

        , from West Beach Surf Life Saving Club, winner of the President's Award for service to Surf Life Saving SA Emergency Rescue Crew; the athlete of the year, Lewis Abdul, from Grange Surf Life Saving Club; the Female Nipper of the Year, Catriona MacLaren, from Grange Surf Life Saving Club; the Assessor of the Year,

        , from West Beach Surf Life Saving Club—and I know that Dennis works with a number of migrants, helping them learn surf skills and the challenges of the waters, so it is a great effort by Dennis; and the Somerton SEALS, from Somerton Surf Life Saving Club, winners of the Community Program of the Year. Congratulations to all on their outstanding work for the community.
