        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. Will the minister inform the House how the government is assisting agriculture and farmers in Australia to prosper, both in my electorate of Dawson and elsewhere?

         I thank the honourable member for Dawson for his question, and might I say the member for Dawson has a strong involvement, especially in the cane industry, being from a third generation cane farm family and also a person who was a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackay_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Mackay City Council
         </a>
         —so he has a strong involvement in the great sugar city of Mackay. He is also a person who I have known has been involved with the National Party since he was 15 years old. If there is one thing that I can say about the member for Dawson, it is that he is no wallflower. He is certainly a person who has an opinion, and for all my knowledge of him he has always let people know what it is. I commend him for the work that he is still doing today, especially in the sugar industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the issues that we have brought about, especially with the Japan
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
          FTA
         </a>
         , was the allowance of high-polarity sugar. We did not sell any high-polarity sugar into Japan at all. We have now sold in excess of 100,000 tonnes, just since March. This is what happens when you have a government that is focused on outcomes, focused on getting a better return back through the farm gate. To the north of the member's electorate is Townsville, which is quickly heading toward becoming the biggest live export venue for cattle. Since we have been in government we have had a 77 per cent increase in the number of cattle that have been exported annually, and a 78 per cent increase in the value. What this is doing is putting real upward pressure on prices.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to refer you to an article today from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Rural" rel="nofollow">
          ABC Rural
         </a>
         , which said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A grazier from the drought-stricken Winton district has achieved a record price for lightweight weaner steers at the Roma saleyards in Queensland. It bolsters industry sentiment that is already riding high on the record-breaking Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, which is currently sitting at 507 cents per kilogram. But it was in Roma where the Angus cross steers hit 306 cents per kilogram and while it is a record specifically for those saleyards, the price is still behind those in the south.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the south, the price has gone up to 319 cents a kilogram.
        </p>
        <p>
         We could talk all the time about cattle, but we could also talk about blueberries. Since September 2013 there has been a 78 per cent increase in the price of blueberries. We could talk about cherries: a 25 per cent increase in the price of cherries.
