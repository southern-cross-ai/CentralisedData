        provides a learning and living environment for officers and cadets of the Australia Defence Force undertaking military training and university studies. The scope and delivery of military training and education has changed since the academy opened in 1986. These changes have resulted in a gap between the current facilities provision and those required.

The total out-turn cost of the proposal is estimated at $410 million, inclusive of GST and land acquisition, with the net costs reduced through the sales of surplus lots.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the Committee. DHA accepts and will imple­ment those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, DHA will deliver 279 dwellings for defence personnel posted in Darwin. The project will be delivered over an eight-year period, with the first house due for completion in December 2013. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the
        <i>
         Public Works Committee Act 1969

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Robertson Barracks
        </a>
        electrical reticulation system upgrade, Darwin, NT.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robertson Barracks is a key Defence base in the Northern Territory and is located approx­imately 20km east of Darwin. It is the home of 1st Brigade, 1st
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Aviation Regiment
        </a>
        and a number of lodger units. The base supports a working population of approximately 3,500 personnel. It was constructed in the 1990s under an initiative called the Army Presence in the North.
       </p>
       <p>
        The original high-voltage system at Robertson Barracks has undergone ad hoc extensions over the past 13 years as the demand for power has grown. The existing high-voltage system is nearing its capacity and has insufficient redundancy to cope with disruptions to the power supply such as outages during tropical storms. The emerg­ency power station has inadequate capacity and cannot fully support capability during power outages. It also lacks the controls necessary for effective power switching and load shedding, which is necessary to ensure that power supply is maintained to critical areas of the base. These shortcomings have a direct impact on the operation of the base and constrain future growth and develop­ment.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a pressing need to upgrade the high-voltage power supply and distribution network to provide a reliable and flexible system which has sufficient capacity to meet future demands. To this end, Defence proposed the following work:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Without a comprehensive upgrade, the high-voltage infrastructure will continue to be affected by power failures and will be further compromised by the need to undertake ad hoc and costly upgrades each time there is an increase in the demand for power. The proposed upgrade will provide a purpose designed power distribution system that will resolve existing inadequacies and will provide for growth and development at the base for approximately 15 years. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $43.4 million, plus GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construc­tion is scheduled to commence in late 2011 and is expected to be completed by mid-2013. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.
