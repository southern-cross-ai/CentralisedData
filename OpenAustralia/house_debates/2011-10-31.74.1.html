       <p>
        On Monday, 3 October, I attended the official naming ceremony of the Bruce Jolly Grandstand at the Salisbury Oval. Bruce Jolly passed away on 6 June 2009 and, in a very fitting recognition of his lifelong association with cricket, the grandstand was named in his memory. I knew Bruce for a long time and, having often been caught up in his ideas and projects, I can attest to his commitment and influence on cricket in

        </a>
        and sport more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bruce played cricket as a youngster and in his adult life devoted much of his time to the Salisbury Cricket Club, which later became the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Districts_Cricket_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Districts Cricket Club
        </a>
        , otherwise known as the Northern Jets, to the Para Districts Cricket Association and to the South Australia Cricket Association, never missing an opportunity to promote the game and broaden community participation in it. Bruce had the good of cricket at heart and he used his extraordinary knowledge and connections in cricket to mentor and guide young cricketers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not surprisingly, there was a large turnout for the grandstand dedication ceremony. It was an emotional occasion for Bruce's family, many of whom were present on the day, particularly for his wife Judy, his son Harvey and his brother Jim. I was able to speak to all of them on the day. I know they were most appreciative that Bruce's tireless work for cricket had been recognised and memorialised with the naming of the Bruce Jolly Grandstand and that his spirit will live on at Salisbury Oval where he had spent so much of his life.
