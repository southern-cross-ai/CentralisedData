       <p>
        I rise in the House tonight to express the concerns of quite a few of my constituents about an issue that has been debated a lot of late—that is, the question of climate change. Many of my constituents have brought their concerns to me. They are concerns that I largely share. The scientific evidence clearly is that there is a significant threat to the world from greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide emissions and global warming and, therefore, the impact of climate—a drier climate in many parts of the world, perhaps more extreme weather events and more extremes of climate—and the potential impact on rising sea levels. In electorates such as mine, there may be impacts on dryness and the threat of bushfires and impacts on some species in endangered ecosystems. There is no doubt in my mind that these are issues that do have to be addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have said to a number of my constituents that many of the criticisms raised about the government’s response to this very real concern are unfounded and unfair—the criticism, for instance, that the government has somehow been sitting on its hands for years and doing nothing. The point that needs to be remembered is that some 10 years ago this government established the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greenhouse Office
        </a>
        to deal with this very issue. We were concerned enough 10 years ago to establish an office to look at the whole issue of greenhouse gas emissions and ways to reduce those emissions in Australia. It has been because of this proactive approach, this initiative and the associated policies that we are one of only four countries in the world on track to reach our Kyoto targets.
       </p>
       <p>
        So this criticism that we have somehow been sitting on our hands and doing nothing is completely unfounded. The $2 billion worth of programs—a range of programs that we have in the pipeline—includes research on alternative energy types and, critically, research into clean coal technology and ways to ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions of the fossil fuel industry. It includes research into renewables and an open-minded debate about the issue of nuclear energy. The fact is that this government has been putting its money were its mouth is to address these issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other criticism that I have had from a number of people in my electorate is that we have not ratified Kyoto and therefore we cannot be serious. The point that needs to be remembered, and the evidence shows it clearly, is this: Kyoto really is a feel-good excuse for doing nothing. So many countries in the world that have signed Kyoto have thought: ‘Well, we’ve done our bit. We’ve signed a bit of paper. We’re okay on the whole issue of climate change; our conscience is clear.’ It is not what you say or write; it is what you do that matters. Many of those countries who have signed the document and ratified Kyoto and who pat themselves on the back and say, ‘What good boys we are: we’ve ratified Kyoto,’ are failing to meet their targets. They are 10 per cent, 20 per cent and, in some cases, 30 per cent above their Kyoto targets, whereas Australia is delivering—ours is one of only four countries to be on track with meeting our Kyoto targets, because it is what we do and not what we say that matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other point that needs to be made is this: if Australia were to sign Kyoto and the major emitters of the world—China, India and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        —do not ratify Kyoto, it would make no difference. Australia only contributes 1.4 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases. We need a program and a commitment from the major emitters: China,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        and India. This is why it is so important that Australia is leading the charge on clean coal technology and exporting that technology to countries like China to help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. It is this that matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Energy Agency estimates that in 30 years time 70 per cent of the world’s power will still be generated by fossil fuels; therefore, it is absolutely imperative that Australia continues to take the lead with research into clean coal technology to reduce the impact of the emissions of those larger emitters like China, India and, to a lesser extent, in this regard at least, the US. Australia is doing its part and will continue to do its part.
