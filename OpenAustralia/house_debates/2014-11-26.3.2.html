             </p>
             <p>
              These are most important matters which do need to be debated by the House. We have seen chronic underperformance in the Defence portfolio since this government was elected. We have seen this government systemically undermine security by trashing confidence in our platforms and capacity; undermine the reputation of Australian industry and the economy more widely; and destroy the morale of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
               Royal Australian Navy
              </a>
              and their confidence in their ships and submarines.
             </p>
             <p>
              The comments by the Minister for Defence will affect recruitment and retention in the Navy. It is—not that the government would care about it—a shocking insult to the thousands of Australian men and women working at the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Submarine_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Submarine Corporation
              </a>
              . Indeed, this is part of the consistent record of incompetence and intemperance that we see from this minister. Does the defence minister still have the Prime Minister's confidence?
             </p>
             <p>
              This motion should be debated. After the defence minister's bombshell yesterday, where he trashed the reputation of our submarine builder, we saw the Prime Minister last night issue a startling repudiation of the Minister for Defence's comments. But does this hapless defence minister realise the hot water he is in? Not at all. That reflects his general lack of awareness of his portfolio. But this morning the opposition are saying: if the government want to draw a line under this Defence confusion, this melee, then the Prime Minister should come in and simply say those magic words which every minister on the ropes, every minister cut adrift, has desperately wanted to hear from their leader: 'I have full confidence in the minister.' There is deafening silence. The Minister for Defence has been abandoned by his government—but there are good reasons why the Minister for Defence should be abandoned by his government.

              Let us have a look at the last 15 months of chronic failure. This is a government who has let Australia's defence capacity down. There has been no progress on the Land 400 project to replace our armoured vehicles. The

                Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Before the question is put, given that the minister just moved that the Speaker be no longer heard, I suggest he might have wanted to move that the member be no longer heard. The consequences of that resolution even I would say would be bad for proceedings.

                  <p>
                   I second the motion. Rather than defend the Defence minister the government have decided they would rather shut down debate. We have given them the opportunity today for the Prime Minister to come into this chamber and decide whether or not they have a Defence minister worth defending. One by one, they have all lined up and said, 'No'. They would rather not have the debate. They would rather not have the discussion or be forced into a situation where someone on that side has to claim, 'We have a fit and proper person in the Defence portfolio.' Last night, the Prime Minister of Australia hung his own defence minister out to dry. We had the member for Mayo going out as a member of the executive, completely disowning the comments of the Minister for Defence. We have Senator Birmingham completely disowning the comments of the Minister for Defence. We have the Prime Minister, in a statement, distancing himself from it. This is now a test of leadership for the Prime Minister of Australia. Either he backs his defence minister or he backs his federal Liberal MPs. The Prime Minister, if he has no confidence in the defence minister, should accept the challenge to get rid of his defence minister.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Just think: we have a defence minister showing no confidence at all in Australia's capacity to build our own submarines, with everything that means—and the defence that he put up on radio this morning! I never thought I would hear a defence minister for our nation use this line:

                  <p>
                   The Minister for Defence on radio said to Australia and to the world, 'Please do not take me seriously.' He has also apologised to the

                      The Prime Minister of Australia refuses to back him in and yet no-one has the courage to say to the defence minister, 'It is time to move on. 'This is a government that has gone for something in the order of 250 days since we have had an Assistant Treasurer. Now we discover we have a defence minister who they do not want either. The Prime Minister should be called into the chamber now. The Prime Minister should come into the chamber and make clear whether or not this defence minister is going to stay or whether Australia is going to have the humiliation of a defence minister no-one will defend.

                        <p>
                         If there was ever a shiny example of a whitewashed tomb and hypocrisy, it is this. Not content with handing over to our government a situation where $16 billion was ripped out of Defence, the Labor Party had a revolving door of three Defence ministers. The first one Labor took into power was described as an electrician in a suit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Not content with taking levels of Defence funding as a proportion of

                          GDP
                         </a>
                         to levels not seen since 1938, not content with reducing project-spending capability—the Labor Party impacted 46 per cent of all projects through their cuts—and not content with having 14 ministerial reshuffles over their six moribund years in parliament, the Labor Party comes in this morning to cry foul. Seriously, are you kidding the nation?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The legacy that Labor left when it comes to defence should have their heads hanging in shame. A 2009 white paper went completely and utterly unfunded. Capability was thrown to the winds. At the height of what the Labor Party was doing in Defence, capability spending as a proportion of the total budget was a mere 18 per cent. That is absolutely and utterly appalling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This is the party that decided to cut counter-

                          IED

                         phase 2 funding whilst we were doing combat operations in Afghanistan. And this party has the hide, the temerity and the audacity to come in and lecture this government about how defence is done. This is the first year in seven years when Defence funding has been stable—$3.9 billion more in Defence funding has been provided, in macro terms, this year than the previous year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Defence funding as a proportion of GDP is 1.8 per cent this year. What was it under the Labor Party? It was 1.56 per cent—the lowest level since 1938. I do not think that any of those opposite were born prior to 1938, which means that there is no-one on the other side that has seen Defence funding drop to such a low level under their watch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         With that as a background—as a history; as a stinking, rotten carcase sitting over the shoulders of the Labor Party—they walk in here and have the temerity to lecture this government on exactly how defence should be managed. Let's look through the history of exactly what the Labor Party did in government. The then Prime Minister—the ultimate minister when it comes to national security—Prime Minister Gillard, could not be bothered attending the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">

                         </a>
                         of cabinet. Who did she send? She sent her bodyguard. That is how the Labor Party treats defence. Their Prime Minister sent her bodyguard along to the National Security Committee of cabinet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         What did Prime Minister Rudd do? Let's look at the consistency of the Labor Party. Prime Minister Rudd sent an adviser to the National Security Committee of cabinet. That is the extent to which the Labor Party treats the National Security Committee. It is simply extraordinary.

                               We all know that the submarine process has at least six months to go. Why does it still have six months to go? Because for six, long, horrid, wintry years, the Labor Party made zero decisions on submarines. Zero decisions were made on our submarine capability—to the point where we are facing a very real capability gap. The Labor Party refused to make a call on the next generation submarine and now demand that we as a government clean up all of their mistakes. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. It is no wonder we were forced to shut down the Leader of the Opposition. Not even his own side could sit quietly and believe what he had to say. It is extraordinary.
