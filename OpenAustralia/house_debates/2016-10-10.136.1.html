       <p>
        Today we celebrate stories of human achievement. Recently, 17-year-old Goldstein resident and Brighton Grammarian Dan Canter joined an exclusive club. Dan is one of only 142 people who have ever completed the triple crown of marathon open water swims: 33.7 kilometres across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel" rel="nofollow">
         English Channel
        </a>
        , 33.7 kilometres across the Catalina channel and 45.8 kilometres around Manhattan island. He is also the youngest male and youngest Australian to have achieved such feats.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such an incredible achievement could not have occurred without hard work and sacrifice, not just by Dan but also by his important support crew, particularly his dedicated and hardworking mother, Doina Canta, and his trainer, and world-renowned elite marathon swimmer, John van Wisse. In November, Dan's unique story will be told in a documentary screening called
        <i>
         The Swim Kid
        </i>
        . The documentary is a story of strength—a battle of mind, body and soul—and a will to succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, Dan was originally inspired, at the age of only 14, to be the youngest Australian male to swim the English Channel by the legacy of fellow Brighton Grammarian Robert Connor Dawes. Known by his second name, Connor was academically gifted and showed sporting prowess. He tragically passed away in 2013, after a 16-month battle with an ependymoma brain tumour. As his mother said, Connor fought his good fight—the best fight—with dignity, courage and humour that belied his years. Dan learned from Connor's legacy the true meaning of courage and strength. After his passing, Connor's amazing parents, Liz and Scott Dawes, established the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD" rel="nofollow">
         RCD
        </a>
        Foundation as a tribute to him and other brain tumour fighters. Each year, the RCD Foundation raises money for pediatric brain cancer. This year, the annual Connor's Run mobilised 3,600 people to raise more than $630,000. Dan's swims also help raise awareness for the RCD foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Goldstein is full of individuals, families and community groups that support each other and help build a great community from the individual upwards, and that is why we are so proud of them. I am sure I can speak for all members in congratulating Liz Dawes, Scott Dawes, Doina Canta, John van Wisse and, particularly, Dan Canta on their amazing achievements and their inspiration, especially in recognition of their effort to help honour the memory and the legacy of Robert Connor Dawes by helping others with brain tumours.
