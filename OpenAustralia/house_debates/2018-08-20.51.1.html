       <p>
        I would like to associate myself with the member for Menzies's acknowledgement of our Vietnam veterans. I turn my focus to Palmerston in my electorate of Solomon, where the wait is almost over for the territory's first new hospital in some 40 years. Yes, the Palmerston Regional Hospital is days away from opening. In anticipation of this, the new hospital held a community open day, and we had about 1,500 people come along to the open day. I'd like to acknowledge all those who contributed to the Palmerston Regional Hospital open day. It was led by their general manager, Catherine O'Connell, and the staff and volunteers from the

        </a>
        that joined in to help the public see how great this new hospital is. For my part, I will put on record that I was successful in getting an extra $40 million out of then-Prime Minister Rudd for this hospital, which has enabled it to become the first-class hospital that it is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's taken 40 years for the Territory to get a new hospital. This one services the Palmerston region. So it is slightly disappointing, I must say, that this federal government has cut $16 million from Territory hospitals. It's not helpful. It is a disgrace and a slap in the face for the Territory's health system. It's great that the Palmerston Regional Hospital is opening; now give us the funds to run our hospitals.
