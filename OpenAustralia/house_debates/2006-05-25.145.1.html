       <p>
        On Anzac Day, I had the great pleasure to join with veterans from the north side of my electorate at the Norlane
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        for their annual commemoration and celebration of this very important day to all Australians. I congratulate the Norlane RSL veterans from all conflicts, emergency service personnel, community support organisations, youth and scouting groups and members of the north side community for their participation, once again, on a commemorative day that means so much to us all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working men and women from Norlane and Corio and other northern suburbs served with great distinction in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        and World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and in other conflicts. We as a community are eternally grateful for the sacrifices they and their families have made in defence of the nation. I was particularly pleased to see the involvement of many young people in the events of the day and commend them for their interest and participation in what has become a significant day in honouring the service and spirit of our Australian service men and women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each Anzac Day the Norlane RSL makes an award to a local citizen who has a consistent record of commitment and service to communities on the north side of my electorate. This year the deserving recipient of this Anzac award was Mr Terry Crooke, who is a member of the Norlane RSL and has worked tirelessly in a range of other organisations for his community. I first met Terry several years ago and admired his contribution to the Corio Football Club in keeping it afloat in the face of severe financial difficulties. The improved financial and public standing of the club enabled it to approach the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        for funds for other amenities, including a netball court which is now operational and providing working families with the opportunity for recreation in the one location each Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terry is an important founding member of the northern community consultative group, which has successfully lobbied for more resources from council for projects on the north side. He has single-handedly guided the development of a proposal to create a children’s park in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corio_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Corio Oval
        </a>
        precinct which is about to come to fruition if some remaining obstacles can be overcome. In his spare time he has delivered bread and other material support to veterans, war widows and veterans’ families on the north side. I congratulate Terry on receipt of this award as it is well deserved, and I congratulate the Norlane RSL on their sponsorship of it.
