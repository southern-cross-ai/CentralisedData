        On Saturday, 10 February 2018, my family and I attended the Townsville Choral Society's 'We Will Rock You' performance. It was an amazing, stunning performance that showcased the depth of talent in our city. The lead performers, Judy Higgins-Olsen as Scaramouche and

        as Galileo, were second to none that I have seen in any international or national performance. The support performers and chorus were also sensational. The script was witty, the directors did an amazing job, the band was exceptional, the sets reflected the story beautifully and the back of house, costumes, hair and make-up were brilliant. The choral society was recognised in the Townsville City Council's 2018 Australia Day Awards, and this performance was evidence of a very fitting acknowledgment.

        Underneath this spectacularly entertaining performance was a truly relevant message. Whilst advances in technology are essential and moving rapidly, we must not lose sight of the need to develop lateral and creative thinking skills that will challenge the status quo where necessary because the arts contribute significantly to the development of new and existing innovative industry solutions, especially at a time when the nature of work is facing significant transformation. The depth of talent in Townsville never ceases to amaze me, and that drives me harder to fight for our fair share of opportunities for the community. I say well done to the choral society on another fabulous performance.
