        On 18 November 2009 when representing the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science I commissioned the C17 heavy airlift simulator that was delivered to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        base at Amberley. The C17 simulator commissioning marked the start of aircrew training in Australia from January 2010. The C17 pilots will undertake their training at Amberley instead of having to travel to the United States of America. It is a demonstration of the cooperative relationship between the

        and its contractors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locals are very proud to have the C17 simulator at the RAAF base at Amberley as part of the redevelopment of the base. It will provide training outcomes that will greatly enhance our ADF operations and humanitarian relief efforts provided by the RAAF C17 fleet, and we have seen that in Samoa recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        The simulator is a replica of the C17 cockpit. It is a great game to play. I had the privilege of having a go. It was great fun. Certainly the simulator is a great addition to our ADF training and operational capacity. It will provide realistic training conditions for all C17 missions. Operational conditions can be generated across a variety of airfields in Australia and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Boeing company built the simulator in the United States and installed it purpose-built at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        . It was constructed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holland_Group" rel="nofollow">
         John Holland Group
        </a>
        and transported to Amberley using two C17 aircraft. It is the centrepiece of the training system. There are 20 simulators owned and operated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         US Air Force
        </a>
        in the United States. This is the first simulator in Australia. As I said, it marks a great achievement for the ADF. Since 2006, the C17 has become a common sight in the Ipswich area. As I indicated, it has been used to great operational effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        The simulator enhances our capacity. It will increase the efficiency of crew training and allow the Air Force to reduce C17 rate of effort in terms of aircraft by 200 hours per year. It will result in a decrease in the frequency of short duration training flights in the Ipswich area and have a positive impact on C17 noise emissions accordinglyâ€”and that is good for the local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The C17 training capability also provides high-technological career opportunities for approximately 15 staff employed in the facility and, therefore, it will prove a positive benefit for the Ipswich area and its economy. I congratulate all those involved, including the US Air Force, the
