       <p>
        This is a motion that was foreshadowed with the formation of the Gillard Labor government following the 21 August election. In the days post voting on 21 August there were a number of discussions across the parliament between the government, the opposition and crossbenchers about the functioning of the parliament. One of the determinations was that it would be appropriate to have a parliamentary budget office and indeed that it would be appropriate that there be members and senators appointed to a joint select committee to oversee the issues relating to the functioning of the parliament, and hence that is why we are moving this motion here today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Parliamentary Budget Office is an important reform. Parliamentary budget offices or their equivalent occur in other parliaments around the globe. This reform will ensure that there is a far greater level of accountability and input from elected representatives, be they members or senators, into the proper functioning of the parliament. It will also enable there to be an appropriate forum to deliberate on the requirements in order to ensure that the parliament is able to function in a way in which the Australian people would expect.
       </p>
       <p>
        After question time today I will move another motion appointing members to the committee. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his expediting of the appointment of those members so that the committee is able to have its first meeting next week. The committee of course will, under the terms of reference of the motion that I have moved today, deliberate on the functioning of its own activities. Certainly I commend the motion to the House and thank the opposition and the crossbenchers for their support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
