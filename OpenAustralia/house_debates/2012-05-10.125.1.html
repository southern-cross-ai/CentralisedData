        I would like to say a few things about my experience in parliament and around the federal office in Gilmore. These words are from Quinn Patterson, a 15-year-old student who did work experience in my office just before the sitting break:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My careers adviser said to me the other day, Quinn, the time has come to work! I found myself asking the same question I had been asking for many years now, what will I do?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Work experience is certainly nothing to take lightly, so I thought it over. After thinking for a while I decided that I would apply where I knew the least: Politics.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I've never really know exactly what went on in parliament, but my chance to find out was here! Immediately seizing the opportunity I handed in my forms at my local members office and hoped I would be accepted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To my surprise I was accepted with a smile and offered a better opportunity: To go to parliament itself!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I had to take an extra week off school, but it was well worth it! Having been interested in debating and public speaking since I could talk, the experience was amazing!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was able to see both behind and in front of the scenes as I glided from office to office. I was able to meet and greet some of the people who run this country, and some who work in their shadows.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The idea of being able to work and watch in this place while other people went about their business was amazing!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Everyday at 1:45 pm, I was given permission to make my way up to the senate or House of Representatives to see question time. The events sometimes became a little bit out of control, but most of the time they were composed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I learned of many things while I was there, including the current bills, who everyone was, and the location of the coffee shop. Priorities may vary between people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Of course, my learning didn't stop in parliament! After three days I came back to the local office and was able to meet many nice people who were happy to take me in. The office, I discovered, is where the nitty gritty stuff happens. All the brochures and posters and campaigns and schedules are made by the people behind the scenes. The work of a politician is not something that is done alone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These people who I've had the pleasure to meet have helped me to learn exactly what I need to know in order to become involved in my community, and what it's like to be a politician. The work involved with parliament is beyond comprehension, it takes a lot of effort to organise an electorate and I appreciate it more now.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm amazed at how hospitable and helpful the staff at Miss Gash's office have been, and I thank them for their friendly support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Quinn. He was certainly a valuable worker in my office and a pleasure to have. We wish him well in his future career. Bearing in mind that Quinn was only 15 when he came to

        , he was a great support to me and my staff.
