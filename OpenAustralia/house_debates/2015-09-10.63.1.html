        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Investment.

How is the misinformation campaign being encouraged by some unions sabotaging Australia's economic future?

         Mr Speaker, on a point of order: ministers can only answer with respect to their own responsibility. There are ministers responsible for a free trade agreement, but today we are hearing about this new thing, this export agreement, whether it has come out of a focus group or—

                       I was asked why it was so important for our economy that the China deal enters into force. If Australia plays its cards correctly, the next 30 years can literally be spectacular—setting up for growth and prosperity throughout the century and beyond.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I can say to my colleague who asked the question, northern Australia can also be a big part of that success. And the reason is, according to the

                       , a surging middle class in the region around us will see 600 million people today class grow to three billion people, not in 100 years, not in 50 years, but in the next 35 years. It is hanging there as a major prospect of prosperity and growth for all of us over the next 30 years.

                      <p>
                       The transformation is happening now. Last year 100 million Chinese left China for a holiday, and a million came to Australia. China expects 200 million people by 2020—again, just five years away—to leave China for a holiday. The transformation in the region is well underway, and the coalition has seen, unlike those opposite, that these three free trade export agreements with Korea, Japan and China—and, ultimately, with India—are a major bridge to the extraordinary opportunities that are emerging on our doorstep. They are a crucial part of the government's plan to diversify our economy post the mining boom.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And the plan is working. We have seen—

                       if you listen you'll find out—with Korea and Japan, in the six months since we entered into force those agreements, food and beverage exports to these countries have increased by 22 per cent and eight per cent respectively. At the same time, exports in those two categories out of China stalled to zero. Now, that just shows the great capacity of these agreements to increase the wealth and prosperity of all Australians in a most material way, but you have to put in place the structures. These agreements are the structures to make that …

There is nothing to negotiate, because you have not identified one thing. This has gone through JSCOT. It is going through the Senate inquiry. It has gone through all sorts of intermediaries, all sorts of research groups and others. Every one of them has confirmed that what we did in this deal is identical to what the worker protections were under the Korean deal, the Japanese deal and the Chile deal. All of those things are identical, and you have not laid a glove on this bill. That is why you are carrying on with that nonsensical question.

When you think about the fact that there is $100 billion worth of goods going to China under the agreement that Minister Robb has negotiated, 95 per cent of our exports to China will be tariff-free when this agreement is fully into effect.

                                 This is great news for small business and for farming and family enterprises, and it is worth remembering that 90 per cent of Australia's exporters are

                                 s but by value it is only five per cent of our export earnings. So there is an enormous opportunity, given that high degree of SME engagement in exports into North Asia and particularly into China, to grow that economic activity and to see the jobs and prosperity flow from it.

                                 Here are a couple of examples from the member's electorate. Frutex are currants and raisin exporters—a great business in the local member's electorate already exporting into Asia but wanting to do more, and they will be able to do more and be encouraged by this trade agreement. Fardoulis Chocolates—I tell you they are unrivalled in reputation for crafting superior, distinctive and great-tasting chocolates. They are looking to delight more citizens in North Asia, including many of the 900,000 visitors from China who come to our country, participate in our economy and are delighted by what we do.

                                 These agreements are very important to shift from the mining boom to the dining boom, but let's not forget how spectacular the service opportunities are under these agreements. We know that services are 70 per cent of our domestic economy, though only 17 per cent of our export income—another enormous opportunity for Australian businesses. This is not about exporting things but about exporting knowhow, education and training in the financial services sector, telecommunications sector, and health and ageing. It is a great opportunity for Australian small businesses, and we should get behind it.

This is why this xenophobic campaign needs to be stared down and defeated. It is not the detail of the deal being negotiated; Labor hates the idea of any deal with China. They want to shut the door to these opportunities. It is on the record there from 2004. You need to change your way, Leader of the Opposition.

                                  My question is to the Minister for Trade. This afternoon on Sky News the minister was asked if it was hard to include mandatory labour market testing in enabling legislation for the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. He said, 'It's not difficult to do, but it does create all sorts of complications.' If it is not difficult, why is the government refusing to safeguard Australian jobs?

Regarding the request that Labor is making, there is not a cigarette paper of difference between the worker protections in this China deal and all the other deals that we have done, including those under Labor. There is not a cigarette paper of difference between them. There is no substance to your arguments. You have tried for weeks now, and no-one—forget about us, but no-one outside—has confirmed the arguments and the cases that you are putting, because when they go into the depth of it they find that the regulations and the requirements are identical. Secondly, if we start to put a bill down, you have a list of requirements as long as your arm. That is the other complication. And it will be all be directed to China and no-one else.

Under the FTA, 95 per cent of our exports to China, such as wine, beef, seafood, lamb and of course resources, will be entirely duty-free. An elimination of tariffs on coal, for instance, and other minerals will earn this country and the companies involved some $600 million. That is exactly what the mining industry needs right now—no delay; right now—so that we can ensure that they remain viable and continue to employ Australians.
