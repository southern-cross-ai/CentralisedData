       <p>
        The 14 November 2022 was a day the people of Eugowra and our region will never forget, a day seared into every corner of our collective memory, Eugowra's darkest day. On that day, torrents of water tore through town. The devastation was shocking. Ten months on and residents are still picking up the pieces. Over 90 per cent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, and, sadly, two much loved local residents lost their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        With such devastation you'd think governments and insurance companies alike would be throwing their support behind this communities and its residents. Sadly, in crucial aspects, our residents have been let down. Governments of both political persuasions have dragged their feet. The

        of

         New South Wales
        </a>
        has still not been given the same level of disaster support that other storm- and flood-hit communities have received. This is outrageous, and the response from insurance companies has been nothing short of callous and cold-hearted. The stories of tragedy are, sadly, everywhere, but so too are the stories of hope and triumph.
       </p>
       <p>
        While governments and insurance companies have been a great disappointment to me, community is what has sustained Eugowra and carried it through from the first moments of this tragedy. Tonight, I'd like to acknowledge some of the unsung heroes who have made such a difference. I haven't been able to name everyone I want to in this speech, and it is my intention to acknowledge the work of more outstanding community members in future contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two people who I do wish to acknowledge tonight are Andrew and Jono Barnes. These two legends have given up their weekends to paint the homes of Eugowra residents, and even some businesses, free of charge. With widespread insurance knockbacks, their work has been a godsend. They are not professional painters; although, now, no doubt, they could be. They are two brothers who love Eugowra and its residents and who saw a need and acted. With their spray painting kit, Andrew and Jono have generously painted 26 homes in Eugowra so far and have another 12 on their list. They offer any colour on the spectrum, as long as it's white. Andrew and Jono recognise that the road to recovery is difficult, and they'll keep on showing up for the people of Eugowra for as long as they're needed. It's a huge effort, and I sincerely thank and acknowledge them for it in this parliament tonight.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge

         David Conyers
        </a>
        . I call him the angel of Eugowra. With the help of approximately 30 volunteer tradespeople, Dave coordinated Fridgy's for Eugowra, where they've successfully supplied and installed air conditioners to more than 130 homes. Dave and the team have committed to air conditioning the entire town, with $400,000 in funds, supplies and equipment. What an extraordinary effort! Thanks to the generosity of so many people across the Central West of New South Wales and beyond, Eugowra and the people who call it home are slowly but surely moving forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of the Wright family. Ash and

        truck and then with catering and helping to source and sort donations, such as food and clothing. They then led clean-up efforts around the district, collecting possessions and valuables that had washed downstream for return to their owners. This included items such as irreplaceable family photos and many other items of sentimental value to local residents. They provided all manner of support to Eugowrans in their times of greatest need.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the clean-up of public areas concluded, they moved on to helping residents rebuild and restore their homes and farms. It has been backbreaking and exhausting work, which was carried out throughout the heat of summer. Every week the call for volunteers was made, and every week the call was answered. Ash and Tim were joined by many different community members, including their daughter, Julia Wright;

        ; and the North Bangaroo RFS brigade to name but a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unsurprisingly, this list could be much, much longer, and, as I've said, future speeches will honour more of our community heroes. I extend a heartfelt thanks to all of the individuals and organisations from around our region and around our country who've worked so hard to support Eugowra and the Central West.
