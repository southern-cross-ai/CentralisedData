       <p>
        I acknowledge those in the press gallery. Clearly, they've come in early to hear my contribution about the coalition government's Local Schools Community Fund!
       </p>
       <p>
        They may well be very interested to hear that schools can apply for grants of between $1,000 and $20,000 to contribute to a variety of school projects and associated costs. I'm fairly certain that my local schools, and yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan—and the member for Barker's and others—will be very keen to get some support. Those projects could include small-scale extensions or classroom refurbishments; new computer facilities; mental health and counselling services; playground equipment; library resources; or sports facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important for schools to lodge one application for each of their campuses. The Local Schools Community Fund is open to government, independent and Catholic schools—so that is all schools. Eligibility conditions do apply, and the proposed projects will be assessed by a committee which I will appoint. The federal government has announced $30.2 million for the Local Schools Community Fund in the 2019 budget. Schools can apply through the website—the SchoolsHub. Applications close on 30 September 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, once again—and very briefly—round 5 of the Stronger Communities Program is open. We are calling for expressions of interest from Monday 5 August. This is a fantastic program that has supported our local communities for a long time. Look at the things we've done: buses with wheelchair access, rowing trailers and kitchen upgrades—and it goes on and on. Have your applications into my electorate office before 9 September.
