       <p>
        A couple of weeks ago world leaders gathered to renew financial pledges for the Global Partnership for Education, aiming to ensure that every child has access to quality education as a birthright. The final figure reached at this meeting was $2.3 billion. It is certainly a big number and worth commending, but it falls well short of the target set to allow the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPE" rel="nofollow">
         GPE
        </a>
        to reach 870 million children to change their lives and our world for the better. Australia pledged $90 million to the GPE over three years. It saddens me that Australia is becoming less generous with each replenishment. This latest pledge is a far cry from Australia's four-year pledge of $270 million in 2011, which was cut to $140 million in 2014 by the Abbott government. I was proud to be part of the Gillard Labor government when, in 2011, Australia was one of the top two donors to the GPE. In 2018, we, a very wealthy country, will likely drop out of the top 10. Shame.

        Deep cuts to our aid budget in recent years are having a tangible impact on our support of vital global mechanisms like the GPE. I have said in this parliament before that international aid, especially when it supports education, is the single greatest enabler of our world's next generation. As a former teacher and now as the parent of two school students I see the importance and impact of education firsthand, as well the challenges faced by those who do not have access to quality education. A quality education is not treated as a human right, but it should be. A quality education is not treated as a global investment in preventing entrenched poverty, but it should be. Australia has the capacity to do so much more.
