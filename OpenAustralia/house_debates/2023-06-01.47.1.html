       <p>
        As MPs we are privileged to meet plenty of extraordinary Australians. I include
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neale_Daniher" rel="nofollow">
         Neale Daniher
        </a>
        in my list of courageous, humble, selfless and inspirational people that I have had the honour to spend some time with. The Daniher name is synonymous with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Rules
        </a>
        , and Neale had a celebrated playing and football career. In his memoir, Neale observes, 'When all is said and done, much more is said than done.' No-one could ever accuse Neale Daniher of that. He is a man of incredible passion and action who actually founded Fight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MND" rel="nofollow">
         MND
        </a>
        in 2014 after being diagnosed with the disease himself, a disease that kills two Australians every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fight MND has raised more than $60 million for research, and just buying one of these beanies is one way we can all help. Neale Daniher has been robbed of his ability to talk, but I contacted him and asked for a message I could read to parliament. This is what Neale told me. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank all Australians have joined in the fight against motor neurone disease. You are part of what I call the Fight MND army. Whether you have bought a blue big freeze beanie, donated or volunteered, you give people like me and others living with MND hope for the future. The many millions you have raised has invigorated medical research in Australia and, in time, we are hopeful this will lead to treatments and, ultimately, a cure for this insidious disease. Until there is a cure, the Fight MND army will fight on. Thanks for being part of the fight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, thank you, Neale Daniher. Australia, please back this man as he fights MND.
