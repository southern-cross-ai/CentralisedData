         I thank the member for Banks for his question. The national interest in and response to the discovery of the final resting place of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and her crew of 645 have been overwhelming. This discovery and the tragic loss of life need to be marked in a manner befitting the significance and importance to this nation. The Navy is planning a commemorative ceremony in the near future, possibly in the next two weeks. The ceremony, while low-key, will include the laying of a suitably worded plaque and a wreath over the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         site. We are also planning a national memorial service to be held in Sydney on 24 April, the day before Anzac Day. This will provide an opportunity for families and other members of the public to commemorate the tragic loss of
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and its crew. We will be releasing further details about a venue and timing shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, a national commemoration will be held on 19 November, on the 67th anniversary of the loss of
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         . Options being considered include a memorial service at the HMAS S
         <i>
          ydney
         </i>
         memorial site at Geraldton and a commemorative onboard service on the current HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         over the wreck of the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         . Of course, family members will be invited. Simultaneously on 19 November, we are planning a memorial service at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>

         We are liaising with the German government regarding appropriate recognition of the loss of their sailors at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSK" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         <i>
          Kormoran

         site. As I announced yesterday, Defence is setting up a 1800 number for families to call to make sure that they are being kept informed. The number will be released as soon as the hotline is operational. In addition, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         is developing a website to keep the public up to date about developments. We are also looking at other ways, including fact sheets, to provide appropriate information to family and friends.

         will be returning to Geraldton late this week and is scheduled to arrive on the evening of Thursday, 20 March. The SV
         <i>

         </i>
         is expected to return to
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         â€™s site to carry out video and photographic examination of the wreckage from this Sunday. Similar examination of the
         <i>
          Kormoran
         </i>
         site will also be carried out once protocols to dive over the wreck have been established between the Australian and German governments. Specialist add-on remote operating vehicle camera and video equipment is being airfreighted in from Norway. This will provide enhanced capability for taking high-definition photographs. Specialist lighting equipment that can be attached to the

         .

         Five specialist ROV operators are currently being mobilised from within Australia and will join the
         <i>
          Geosounder
         </i>
         once she has returned to port. The remotely operated vehicles will not interfere with the vessels in any way or retrieve any objects or artefacts from the seabed. Once we have gathered the data, the

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to commend and support the government on the way in which it is handling this matter and ask that the opposition be briefed and have the opportunity to participate in the development of the arrangements. I think the government is handling this particular matter sensitively and appropriately.
