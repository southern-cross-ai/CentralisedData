        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , we are known for our beaches, lakes, valleys and sporting achievements, to name but a few, but, sadly, there is also a dark side for which we are nationally known. Tragically, until recently, the Central Coast had one of the highest numbers of youth suicides. I am fortunate to represent an electorate with a number of organisations that are determined to take practical measures to assist youth who are struggling with mental illness and hence alleviate the tragic loss of young lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        A successful program currently being undertaken in my electorate is SOKS, which is short for Save Our Kids. Conceived and administered by the Gosford North Rotary Club, the SOKS program has been operating on the Central Coast since 2010. The Save Our Kids program was originally founded as a youth suicide prevention program; however, in 2012 it also branched out into a youth enrichment program. North Gosford Rotary raised over $17,000 and formed a partnership with Lifeline to deliver a program called safeTALK, which is designed to train school staff to identify and approach young people who indicate contemplating suicide. In the first year, nine Central Coast schools undertook the training, and 18 young people were subsequently identified as being at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club has raised more funds to continue and expand SOKS in order to maximise their impact on the youth of the Central Coast. In 2014, SOKS donated $26,000 to Lifeline, which allowed them to deliver more programs, resulting in the saving of 39 lives. This year has been another year of growth for SOKS, with a further 12 programs delivered and additional funds raised to deliver a high-level program called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIST" rel="nofollow">
         ASIST
        </a>
        â€”Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training. ASIST is a two-day program targeted at deputy and year heads of schools, school counsellors and welfare staff who support youth in crisis. ASIST provides participants with the skills and understanding to identify at-risk students, make appropriate suicide intervention and provide suitable referrals. Feedback received from participants in the ASIST workshop was resoundingly positive, with many feeling better prepared and equipped to help people who are at risk of contemplating suicide. The youth enrichment arm of SOKS consists of four Rotary youth programs. Since youth enrichment began, SOKS have been able to increase the number of youth attending the program from 13 in 2013 to 24 in 2014. This year, they have facilitated the attendance of 37 young adults. SOKS have received tremendous feedback on the success of their programs and are eager to continue their expansion. SOKS are aiming to increase training to 1,000 school staff and parents, plus 100 young adults, in leadership programs over the next two years, at a cost of approximately $150,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the last two years, I have been proud to be an advocate and sponsor of the SOKS program, as I recognise the vital role they play in tackling youth suicide rates on the Central Coast. The silent nature of suicide is most lethal, and raising awareness to ensure that those who battle inner demons are comfortable to discuss the issues they face has to be a priority if we are to reduce the rate of youth suicide. Evidence demonstrates that medical and community interventions prevent suicide, yet often the coordination and strategies of suicide prevention activities are lacking and ineffectively organised. SOKS have been working hard to bridge the gap in youth suicide prevention strategies and programs. Each year, their programs are proving successful in saving lives. Alarmingly, 2014 data indicated that a total of 6,369 youths aged 11 to 17 years on the Central Coast were at risk of suicide. The most recent data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        indicate that 172 Central Coast families had been directly impacted by suicide in suburbs across my electorate in recent years. In 2010, a Senate committee estimated that the number of people immediately affected by one suicide is six; however, I maintain that there is no possible way to determine how many people are truly affected by something of this nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work of the Gosford North Rotary Club through their Save Our Kids program is hugely beneficial to the community. The volunteers of this Rotary club, particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Pearson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sharpe" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Sharpe
        </a>
        , have undertaken a number of initiatives, some mentioned previously, to reduce youth suicide. I commend Lester, Michael and the Gosford North Rotary Club for taking the initiative to develop and implement SOKS and for their dedication to expanding the program in the coming year. Unfortunately, suicide is a huge problem in my electorate, and we are working very hard with these groups to reduce that number and help those people who have mental health issues. I once again commend Lester and Michael and the Rotary club for all their hard work.
