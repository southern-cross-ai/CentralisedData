        Bill Darragh of Darragh's Butchers in Casino has retired after working as a butcher for 64 years. Bill started out as an apprentice butcher in 1959 at the age of 15. He then went into partnership and opened a butcher shop in 1970. Then Bill and his wife, Lyn, went on to open their own butcher shop—Darragh's Butchers—in 1981. The first shop was in Barker Street, and they later moved to the Casino Plaza Shopping Centre, where the shop has been located for the last 30 years. Bill and Lyn have employed many people from the Casino area, including butchers, apprentices and clean-up kids. Many of their current and previous employees, family, friends and locals attended their retirement celebrations.

        Even though Bill, who turns 80 in October, has retired, he will continue with his work with Rotary where he has been a member for 38 years and will be helping his son at his mechanics workshop. Lyn is looking forward to retirement. Bill and Lyn have two children, Tony and Joanne; five grandchildren, Stephanie, Chloe, Christopher, Simon and Katie; and one great-grandchild, Tomie. Thank you, Bill and Lyn, for the many decades of your wonderful service to our community, and enjoy your retirement.
