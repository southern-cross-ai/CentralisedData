          . We believe it is inappropriate for the use-of-force power in a detention centre facility to be more readily applied than is possible in a police detention environment. I am therefore proposing to amend the bill to include an objective test of reasonableness and necessity for the use of force. In respect of amendment (4), the bill currently includes provisions to prevent the use of reasonable force in specific circumstances; however, similar to the amendments outlined above, Labor believes the legislation should include an objective test of reasonableness and necessity in regard to the limitations of the use of force.
         </p>
         <p>
          In respect of amendment (5), Labor is also concerned that many of the most significant limits on the use of force are referred to in the explanatory memorandum as matters that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will include in administrative policies and procedures and not in the legislation itself. Labor supports the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission that these limits on the use of force, particularly those in regard to excessive force, be included in the legislation. Labor is also seeking to amend the legislation to specifically address the use of reasonable force against children in detention. Specifically, a new provision should be added to provide that an authorised officer must not exercise the power to use force in relation to a minor unless: all alternatives to the use of force, including negotiation and de-escalation techniques, have been attempted and failed; where possible, the proposed use of force has been raised with the minor's parent or guardian and the parent or guardian has been given sufficient opportunity to both speak with the minor and to make submissions to the authorised officer about the use of force; authorisation for the particular use of force has been sought and obtained from the director of the facility; and, where it is not possible to discuss the proposed use of force with the minor's parent or guardian in advance, force is only then used where there is an unacceptable risk of escape or immediate harm to the child or others.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor also has concerns regarding the power to use force to move children and adults in immigration detention facilities. Therefore, I am moving an amendment to introduce a new subsection which clarifies that when an authorised officer intends to use force in order to move a detainee within an immigration detention facility, this must be preceded by: a request to the detainee to move, with the assistance of an interpreter if required; the detainee having been given a reasonable opportunity to move voluntarily; and all reasonable alternatives to the use of force being exhausted, prior to force being used to move a detainee.
         </p>
         <p>
          In respect of amendments (1), (6) and (8), as noted earlier, this bill will put in place a statutory complaints mechanism. As I also noted, a number of stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the fact that the departmental secretary will have the discretion to conduct the investigation in any way that he or she considers appropriate, and to decide not to investigate the complaint at all if certain conditions are met.
         </p>
         <p>
          Furthermore, the bill does not specify what the outcome of these investigations may be, either in terms of practical remedies for complainants or disciplinary consequences for authorised officers and service providers. There is also no proposal for there to be any independent oversight of the use of force in detention facilities or of the complaints process itself. I am therefore proposing amendments which specify that the secretary must notify the Commonwealth Ombudsman in writing of the receipt of the complaint. In addition, the amendments give the Commonwealth Ombudsman the power to review the administration of the secretary's investigation of complaints, and to report to parliament on an annual basis about the comprehensiveness and adequacy of the processes used by the secretary.
         </p>
         <p>
          In respect of amendments (9) and (10), Labor has serious concerns regarding section 197BF of the bill, which will place a partial bar on legal proceedings against the Commonwealth in relation to the use of force. The Human Rights Commission shares these concerns and notes that the existing provision does not make it sufficiently clear that there are two criteria that must be satisfied in order for immunity to be obtained—namely, that the use of force by an authorised officer must not exceed what is authorised by the bill and that the power to use force must be exercised in good faith.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Human Rights Commission also noted there is no real justification for the Commonwealth to have a separate immunity from litigation over and above that provided to the authorised officer. The proposed amendment to subsection 197BF(1) and the deletion of subsection 197BF(4) give effect to these concerns.
         </p>
         <p>
          The final amendment, amendment (11), will amend the Ombudsman Act to reflect the earlier changes which give the Commonwealth Ombudsman powers with respect to the complaints mechanism. With these comments, I commend these amendments to the House.

           The government obviously opposes these amendments in toto, and the reason is quite simple. I think this is a Labor-Greens stunt which is not becoming of the shadow minister. The shadow minister tries to have a sensible approach to these matters but is completely and utterly deviated by the Left within his own party. They are in some sort of arms race with the Greens to try to be further to the left when it comes to these very serious matters.
          </p>
          <p>
           This government made it very clear that we would stop boats and we have done that. During Labor's period in government, 52,000 people came on 821 boats. Labor completely lost control of border security in this country. There is no question about that at all. In 2011, we saw the result of the pressure of those people arriving within the detention centre network when serious riots took place at two centres in particular. People were flowing in across our borders with no control by the then government and it resulted in this sort of action taking place within the detention centre network.
          </p>
          <p>
           This government have stopped the boats, we have closed down 13 detention centres, we have reduced the number of children in detention centres from a peak of 1,992 when Labor was in government down to 100—and we want to reduce that number even more. At the same time, we have made a very clear point to those people within detention centres that we will not tolerate the sort of behaviour that we saw in 2011. I will not tolerate people being assaulted within detention centres.

             I will not tolerate the staff within those detention centres being assaulted, and I will not tolerate Commonwealth property being destroyed within those centres. Out of the 2011 riots, Labor commissioned a review into their own failings within the detention centre network. The review came back with recommendations which we have implemented in this bill. In this bill we codify what is reasonable force to be used by those officers within those facilities—not only for their own protection but also, most importantly, for the protection of the people within those centres. Labor commissioned the report into their own failings. The review came back with recommendations which have been accepted by us—and, I might say, accepted by Labor up until this point.
            </p>
            <p>
             I received no notification of these amendments before coming into this chamber. I have received no notification from the shadow minister that he had any problem with this bill. I had no notification from the shadow minister that he was going to cosy up beside the Greens and the member for Indi in relation to this matter. I had no prior notice whatsoever. Is this a genuine attempt to try to improve the bill? Of course it is not, because the shadow minister and the Labor Party had indicated their support for the bill. What has happened? The Labor Party have been taken over internally by the left wing of their party. We hear a couple of voices within this chamber but there are others out there. I feel for the shadow minister, because he is trying, I think, in a genuine way to implement sensible policy. But he is just on the eve of his greatest test. The Labor Party are going to have a very important discussion about this, and let us see whether or not they are serious when it comes to these border protection management issues. If you start the boats up again, the detention centres will re-open, the kids will go back into detention and we will have the same riots that we saw in 2011 when Labor lost control of the detention centre network. We are not going to go back to those bad days. We will not allow the boats to restart—

               We will not allow the riots to recommence within the detention centres, and we are not going to give ground to the Labor, Greens and member for Indi movement. We are not going to surrender to people smugglers, who are lurking in the shadows right now waiting for the Labor Party to be successful at the next election so that boats can recommence and the riots can recommence within detention centres. We will not allow the Left of the Labor Party to dominate policy in this country. We will stop the boats into the future. If the Labor Party are re-elected, they will allow the boats to recommence.
