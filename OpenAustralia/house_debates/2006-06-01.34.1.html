                   I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and for her interest. I know a number of members of the House are very interested in the issue of Iran, as was witnessed by the debate about the rights of the Baha’i people in Iran. I recall, for example, the speech by the member for Stirling very passionately in support of the Baha’i people.

                   The government has been engaged in efforts in the broader international community to persuade Iran to comply with its international obligations through

                   resolutions concerning its nuclear activities. I noticed yesterday, Washington time but overnight, that the

                   </a>
                   , supported by the President himself, has announced that, as soon as Iran fully and verifiably suspends its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, the United States will join with the three European Union countries—France, Germany and the United Kingdom—in direct talks with Iran. This constitutes a very significant change in American policy in dealing with Iran. It is a change that we think is constructive, and it underscores the United States’s commitment, which is shared by us, to try to find a diplomatic solution to the problem of Iran’s nuclear program.

                   Australia would urge Iran to use the opportunity that is now being presented by the United States to seriously consider a comprehensive package of initiatives and, in exchange for that package of initiatives, to reinstate a full and verifiable suspension on all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to comply fully with resolutions of the

If it does so, Iran will be isolated and there is always the prospect that, either through the United Nations Security Council or on a bilateral basis, a series of sanctions, including financial sanctions, could be imposed on Iran.

                   So we would urge Iran to take very seriously the offer that has been made by the United States administration, to embrace the offer that has been made by the Americans, to ensure that they fall into line with the mainstream of the international community and to suspend their enrichment and reprocessing programs so that negotiations of a constructive nature can take place.
