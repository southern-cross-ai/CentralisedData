        The Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2021 removes the lower age eligibility restriction from the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to allow eligible children under 18 years of age, and newly including eligible children under two years of age, to access the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDBS" rel="nofollow">
         CDBS
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Removing the lower age eligibility restriction of two years is based on the recommendations of the
        <i>
         Report on Fourth Review of the Dental Benefits Act 2008
        </i>
        (the review) and follows consultation with stakeholders. The review found that it was important to establish a positive initial dental experience and instil important oral hygiene practices at an early age to curb the negative stigma around dental practitioners and oral hygiene, which is reinforced if the initial dental experience requires serious treatment. If parents promote and practice good oral health hygiene with their children from a young age this will help prevent more serious dental decay as they grow older. This change will increase access to prevention and treatment services for younger children.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment will expand the number of children who are eligible for the CDBS by around 300,000 per year and cost $5.4 million over four years. The CDBS has been in operation since 2014 and over that time has provided over $2.3 billion in benefits and delivered more than 38 million services to over three million Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CDBS plays an important role in promoting the oral health of Australian children by providing access to basic dental services up to a cap of $1,013 in benefits over two calendar years. The CDBS helps children build good oral health and habits through to adulthood.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CDBS is available in both the private and public sectors to allow the broadest range of service provision, choice and access to services in a range of settings and locations. The government will continue to work with private and public providers to improve the delivery of dental services to Australia's children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
