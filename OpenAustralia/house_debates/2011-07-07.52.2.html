       <p>
        Today is a very special day for one of my constituents, and in fact she is a constituent of my own household who joins us in the gallery today. Abbey Rose Morrison today turns four. It is a very special day for us. Those who were in this place when I made my maiden speech might recall that I talked about my daughter, who was our miracle child. We are blessed to have two children, and Abbey was the product of 14 long years of waiting and various fertility treatments and other things—it was a very difficult period of time for our family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to commend today my wife Jenny, who is in the gallery with us, for her patience and prayers over many years and her faithfulness. I also want to thank Dr Anne Clarke and Professor Alan Lam, who were instrumental in the treatment that we went through over many years and were responsible for the great blessing we have with our two wonderful children. Abbey is a miracle child—she was born on the seventh of the seventh of 2007. That tells me that God has a very good sense of humour in reminding us of his faith in us, and his faith being expressed through these two children is remarkable.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is rare that we meet in this House in July so I doubt that in the future we will have the opportunity to have Abbey's birthday again in this place. It is a great thrill and a privilege to wish my dear, beautiful daughter Abbey a very happy birthday. We love you very, very much.
