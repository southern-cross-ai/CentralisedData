       <p>
        In the budget we saw one figure that really jumped out at all of us: unemployment is increasing. Next year, the year after—in fact, unemployment in this country is the highest rate it has been since the Prime Minister was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations under the Howard government. Youth unemployment in regional areas is also up. In my own area of Bendigo it is up to 19 per cent. One in five young people are unable to find work. It is an absolute disgrace that this government's budget failed to have a comprehensive jobs plan. This government is failing on jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, sure, there is a boost—perhaps in retail jobs. Perhaps there will be a few extra people employed at Harvey Normal to help 'Tony's tradies', but that is not a long-term future jobs plan. That does not help that 19 per cent of young people in Bendigo have a job and a career for life. What we need is a government and a plan that encourages and invests in our young people, that gives them the opportunity, that gives them the education and the chance.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I met with the Bendigo Manufacturing Group, they said that they want to employ young people but there is a severe lack of opportunities for them to train in the fields that they need: maths, science, engineering and technology. It is time this government got on board and invested in long-term investment in jobs and future jobs, not more rhetoric.
