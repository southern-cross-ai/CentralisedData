        Today, one year ago, Beirut was rocked by a terrible explosion. The images of that explosion quickly made their way right around the world and shocked all who saw them. One year on, its effects are still being felt. People are still trying to make sense of their loss and we have yet to see a proper authoritative investigation into what happened and who was responsible. On behalf of the

        , I extend my deepest sympathies to the Lebanese community in Australia and to the people of Lebanon on this anniversary of the tragedy. I know that your community remains deeply affected by this. I know that your sadness is made even greater by the pandemic that keeps you from being able to take even the small degree of solace that is offered by being able to grieve together. Labor stands firmly by your side in your fight for justice. We will continue to call on the Australian government to support a transparent, independent and impartial investigation into this tragedy. To the people of Lebanon and

        right across the country, my message is this: we pray with you and we stand with you. Our thoughts are also with Sarah Copland and Craig Oehlers. Driven by their love for Lebanon and by the precious memory of their son Isaac they have been at the forefront of advocacy for justice for the victims. We ask the government to listen carefully to their message. An impartial independent investigation will help them and other victims heal. May justice comeâ€”
