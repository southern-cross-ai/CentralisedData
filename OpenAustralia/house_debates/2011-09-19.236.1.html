        I rise to speak to the motion on the importance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        Australia. For more than 100 years, Australians and tourists have been drawn to Australia's beaches. With an estimated 100 million beach visitations each year, safety on the beach is vital. As I have stated before, surf lifesaving is an active part of Australia's local communities. Our movement prides itself in offering mateship, education and experience. In doing so, it is giving back to the community. I am proud to be a member of both the Bridport and Launceston Surf Life Saving clubs in Tasmania. I have had a long association with the movement.
       </p>

        have played a valuable role in reducing the number of deaths in our coastal waters. They have provided a safe and educational environment for all ages to enjoy on Australia's popular coastline. Their work is to be commended. Unfortunately there are still some tragedies in our waters. Surf Life Saving Australia released its
        <i>
         2011
        </i>
        <i>
         National Coastal Safety Report
        </i>
        last week. Among the key findings of the report was that there were 61 coastal drowning deaths last year. However, this is below the seven-average of 89. Fifty-two, or 85 per cent, were males; 14, or 23 per cent, were aged between 20 and 29 years, the most common age group; 21, or 34 per cent, were of foreign ethnicity of which five percent were international visitors. Over 40 per cent occurred during summer which is why I want to highlight this topic now as we are coming into the warmer months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nineteen, or 31 per cent, were attributed to swimming or wading; 17, or 28 per cent, were attributed to boating; and six, or 10 per cent, were attributed to rock fishing. Out of all our coastal drownings, 12, or 20 per cent, were attributed to rip currents. Education is important in avoiding these tragic drownings. Forty-eight per cent of drownings occurred at the beach and 22 of the victims lived less than 10 kilometres from their drowning location. Thirty-one drownings occurred less than five kilometres from a lifesaving service.

Peter George also highlighted that men continued to be overrepresented in the coastal drowning data and that this is down to a mixture of bravado and an inflated sense of ability. We are still seeing too many young men's lives cut short. We should be educating our communities about the importance of water safety.

        presented certificates to members and talked about the national coastal safety policy. In October this year at parliament house, Surf Life Saving Australia will be releasing a report on the economic contributions of surf lifesaving in Australia. The Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving are encouraged to attend that preview. Something that you can talk about to those in your electorates who have iPhones or iPads is a free application provided by Surf Life Saving Australia called Beachsafe. Beachsafe displays beach safety information for visitors to Australian beaches and provides the day's beach information such as real-time hazards and beach status information when lifesavers are present.
       </p>
       <p>
        Community education plays a vital role in SLSA's aquatic safety. SLSA provides a number of courses to help people understand the surf, along with community courses in first aid and resuscitation. The important message is that the only way to swim safely at a beach is between the flags. We also recommend that people swim with a mate and to refrain from swimming at night and also if they have consumed alcohol.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surf lifesaving is the largest volunteer movement of its kind in Australia, and I would encourage people to join and support the important work of surf lifesaving. With summer fast approaching and the patrol season commencing, people who want to learn the skills of surf lifesaving can contact their local club. With the skills I have learnt in surf lifesaving, I have carried out seven resuscitations, and one of my daughters, Michelle, has successfully resuscitated two people. You can help save the life of someone close to you one day. I encourage people to stay safe at the beach and to donate and to participate in surf lifesaving. Every Australian should be a swimmer and every swimmer should be a lifesaver. Every Australian can help save a life.

           The member for Bass has just interrupted to say that in that process he lost one person. I think that also shows the true impact of this work and how great and important it is, because it is serious business and people can lose their lives. I think that actually makes what the member for Bass has done all the more commendable, because that could not have been an easy process for him. I once again acknowledge the significant role that he has played as a surf lifesaver.
          </p>
          <p>
           It gives me great privilege, as I said earlier, to stand in support of this motion. Early last year, one of the first things I did as the member for Wannon was to have the Leader of the Opposition come down to my electorate. It was fantastic, because I was able to take the Leader of the Opposition to one of my surf life saving clubs, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Fairy" rel="nofollow">
            Port Fairy
           </a>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
            Surf Life Saving
           </a>
           Club. This club has been in operation since roughly 1924 and it has been doing fantastic work since then.
          </p>
          <p>
           The club welcomed the Leader of the Opposition with open arms. It was very much a bipartisan event. There was a bit of a sausage sizzle, and then the Leader of the Opposition went out on a surf boat—out over the waves. I must say that I do not think he had been in one of those boats for about 10 years, but he sat in it and went over the waves like he had been doing it all of his life. I think the rest of us probably would have found it quite an exhausting process but he managed to do it without really taking a breath. It was a fantastic day, and it really hit home to me the important role that surf lifesavers play. I would like to support the member for Bass in encouraging people in Australia to get involved with their surf lifesaving club, because the Port Fairy club, for one, has a workload that is falling on fewer and fewer people. They need new members and they need younger members because they are getting to the stage where they are beginning to wonder whether they can patrol that each for the whole of the summer. I think this is an excellent motion that the member has brought forward. I would once again encourage every Australian to think about joining the local surf lifesaving club. It is absolutely important that is done. We have to make sure that like every volunteer organisation the workload is not left for a diminishing few. We especially need to encourage the younger generations. I take that as my generation and those below to make sure they continue to get involved with community organisations because it is absolutely vital work that we that they do.
          </p>
          <p>
           In my electorate we also have a lift surf lifesaving club in Warner and ball. I was very privileged to go there and helped open a new room they have just built at the wobble surf lifesaving club. It has been in operation since 1930. They do terrific work there as well. It is a fantastic club. It is a terrific facilities and it is a fantastic beach. As a matter of fact, it is such a terrific beach because not only can people swim at it but they still take the local horses there to train them. It is a terrific multiuse of the beach. It has led to warn will now being one of the best training facilities in Victoria.
          </p>
          <p>
           What Campbell also has a terrific surf lifesaving club and they do terrific work there. Once again, it has got one of the best views, as most surf lifesaving clubs do, after coastal area and the magnificent coastal area that goes along the southern border of my fantastic electorate.
          </p>
          <p>
           In summary, I once again the issue at what the member for Bass has said. Surf lifesaving is a great volunteer activity. We need to encourage more and more people to get involved. As summer approaches, if we could all take a step back and think do we have the time? Should if we can, get involved with surf lifesaving.

           <p>
            I rise in support of this very important motion which goes to acknowledging the great work of a surf lifesavers and highlighting the importance of water safety. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the member for Bass for bringing this important that matter to the attention of the House.
           </p>
           <p>
            This motion rightly acknowledges a surf lifesavers who risk their lives to perform rescues in Australia every year but in particular last year and also recognises the contribution of surf lifesavers in northern Australia as their first season comes to an end. Surf lifesavers have been protecting the lives of beachgoers for over a century. It is one of Australia's largest volunteer organisations with a total membership of around 130,000 and an active team of around 40,000 people who patrol our coastline on a regular basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is estimated that surf lifesavers spend more than 1 million hours patrolling our beaches each year. If you think about it, 1 million hours is such an incredible contribution patrolling our beaches, performing rescue operations and using support services such as helicopters and rescue boats. Together each year
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Lifesavers" rel="nofollow">
             Surf Lifesavers
            </a>
            rescue around 11,000 people, provide emergency care to 35,000 and safety advice to more than 600,000. These dedicated astray and volunteers spend their time creating a safe environment around our beaches through patrols and through education initiatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            When faced with hazardous and potentially life threatening scenarios, surf lifesavers frequently demonstrate exceptional courage and skill in order to protect and save the lives of their fellow Australians. I cannot speak highly enough of the selfless men and women who give up their own time to protect and save and promote life along our coastline. In my electorate we have five great Surf life saving clubs in order to take this opportunity to congratulate all the members and volunteers at Aldinga Surf life saving club, Moana Surf life saving club Southport Surf life saving club,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Noarlunga" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            serve lifesaving club and Christies Beach Surf life saving club, which I have the privilege of also being a member of. This motion recognises the importance of water safety as we head into the warmer months in the southern parts of Australia. Taking the family for a day at the beach is part and parcel of the Australian way of life and I would certainly encourage everyone to come down to my electorate, which has 31 kilometres of beach on pristine coastline. However, while we have some beautiful beaches it is also vital to remember that we must stay vigilant about water safety. Unfortunately, in my electorate we have had a tragic start to the warmer months with a scuba diver drowning at Port Noarlunga only a few days ago. The stark reality is that beaches are dangerous environments and the demand for vigilance is important for every Australian.
           </p>
           <p>
            The national coastal safety report compiled by Surf Lifesaving Australia, released last week, reported a total of 61 coastal drowning deaths between 2010 and 2011. While this figure is below the seven-year average of 89, which I think is really important to note, it remains that every life lost is one too many. The report also reveals that almost 50 per cent of drowning deaths occurred five kilometres or more from the nearest surf lifesaving station. These figures suggest that surf lifesavers are an effective means of preserving the life of swimmers. The motion also urges 'users of aquatic environments', including 'pools, rivers, lakes and the surf, to understand those environments' are dangerous and to exercise caution. Drowning does not just happen at the beach or in swimming pools. It can happen in rivers, in creeks, in streams, in lakes, in dams or in lagoons. One disturbing trend has seen a substantial increase in the proportion of drownings occurring in the over-55 age group and in the under-five age group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Learning to swim is a really important part of the Australian lifestyle. I would certainly encourage people to take advantage of the wide range of educational programs available through Surf Lifesaving Australia. I note that the motion does urge people to think about learning to swim and I would like to say—given my previous life as a swimming teacher, having taught mums and bubs classes as well as adult learn-to-swim classes and everything in between—it is never too late to learn how to swim. I say to anyone out there that improved water confidence could be the thing that saves your life. I would like to conclude by again commending the member for Bass on this motion which provides a valuable opportunity to recognise the wonderful work of our surf lifesavers in protecting lives at the beach. Also, it provides a timely reminder to all Australians to ensure that they are water smart, as summer sets in in the southern areas of Australia, and to listen to the advice of surf lifesavers and always swim between the flags.

             I would like to commend the member for Bass for bringing forward this motion about surf lifesavers. It is a very important motion. I rise to speak on it because the history of Higgins is inextricably linked to one of the most tragic events in our nation's history, the loss of Prime Minister

             in 1964. Harold Holt, as all of you would know, was a former member for Higgins and he brought, through this tragic event, into the nation's consciousness the danger of our waters and our beaches. The beach culture is one of the defining features that make Australia the greatest place in the world in which to live. Be it the calm waters of

             , surf, sand and sun is an iconic element of the Australian social and cultural fabric.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, with these simple pleasures come inherent dangers and that is why I stand to applaud and pay tribute to one of the very significant volunteer organisations in this country, Surf Lifesaving Australia. This volunteer organisation has been with us for over 100 years. The first lifesaving group appeared at Bondi Beach in 1907. It quickly developed into nine affiliated groups around Sydney beaches and by the 1930s state organisations had been established in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             ,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australia
             </a>
             and Queensland. By 1952 all states had established their own associations and today there are over 307 clubs nationwide including 57 in my own state of Victoria. The organisation still operates on a volunteer basis with around 15,000 active volunteers registered. This is truly an inspiration. As with other emergency services, there is no higher calling than to risk one's own life to save another, and we have heard from the member for Bass about his experiences in this regard. The ability to see somebody in danger, identify that risk and run towards that risk in order to save them is something that is truly noble. On most recent figures in Victoria we know that there were over 423 rescues performed last year, and 1,190 people required first aid, delivered by lifesavers. Thankfully, according to this year's national coastal safety report, drowning deaths are down. But even though those deaths are down—as has been so eloquently mentioned by my colleague just before—one drowning death is one too many.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is important to understand and become confident around water. That is why the junior lifesaving organisation, the Nippers, is so important. It involves over 8,000 kids aged six to 13. This is also run by volunteers who give up their time on the weekends and during holidays to teach children about water safety and surf rescue. Being a land girt by sea, sea salt is in our veins. From

              Grant Hackett
             </a>
             , swimming is a key component of the Australian way of life. Just like these champions, swimming must be taught at an early age to help reduce the risk of any potential disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
             While it is important to know about water around beaches, it also terribly applicable around the home as well because tragedies are not limited to beaches alone. In fact, half of all drownings for children aged between one and four occur at the family home. According to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KidsHealth" rel="nofollow">
              KidsHealth

             produced by Laurie Lawrence and the government outlines the five necessary steps to ensure kid safety around water. It is something that I will definitely be promoting even more actively in the lead-up to summer later this year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, learning to swim is not simply about survival. Swimming is a fantastic way to stay fit. The beauty of swimming is that all you need is a body of water. Swimming can also be very social. In my final moments I want to mention the Malvern Marlins. The Marlins consist of two groups: over twenties and seniors. Both groups compete in a number of national competitions and have a rich history of success, taking home a number of trophies. Beyond competing they also get involved in social activities, with frequent dinners, barbecues and events being a common occurrence.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to finish by highlighting the volunteer nature of surf-lifesavers. Volunteers are the glue that binds our society together. Giving one's time to serve others without seeking reward is a truly gracious calling and its significance cannot be underestimated in the complex tapestry that is Australia.

             <p>
              I want to thank very much my colleague, the member for Bass, who has a lifetime of involvement in surf-lifesaving in his sporting life. He is a passionate advocate. He had a lot to do with surf-lifesaving in my electorate of Braddon—when he did not need permission to come into Braddon! On my staff, Kay Eastley is a dedicated surf-lifesaver and is an example of the many volunteers that make up seven of Tasmania's 14 clubs on the north-west coast of Tasmania in my electorate of Braddon. I want to thank each and every one of those surf-lifesavers, as my colleagues on both sides of the House have been thanking those representatives of surf-lifesaving clubs in their electorates on this motion tonight.
             </p>
             <p>
              Australians love the water. We have been attracted to the coast for a long time—over a hundred years. We have something like a hundred million beach visitations per year, something like 11,600 beaches and 36,000 kilometres of coastline, some of the best of which are in Tasmania. Since 1907, surf-lifesaving has done everything possible to help educate our communities about water safety and also have patrolled our beaches and our coastlines—none more so than on the north-west coast of Tassie.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Tasmania there are 14 clubs: of those, Boat Harbour, Burnie, Devonport, Penguin,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Sorell" rel="nofollow">
               Port Sorell
              </a>
              , Somerset and Ulverstone are on the north-west coast. Just for the record, and proudly so, 99 lifesaving rescues were made last year in Tasmania, 350 first aid treatments were administered and 1,931 preventative actions were taken to avoid tragedies from happening in the first place. Those statistics are very admirable but nationwide, just as in Tasmania, there is a lot more that we need to do. Any assistance that surf-lifesaving clubs can receive from communities and from government in particular is very well used. I will demonstrate this with an example. A recent merger of offshore rescue groups has seen
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
               Surf Life Saving
              </a>
              Tasmania grow to 15 clubs and services, and some affiliates I must add, and is now capable of delivering inland, inshore and offshore rescue services to complement existing emergency services. To complement these services a state-wide 13
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SURF" rel="nofollow">
               SURF
              </a>
              phone activation system has been introduced in conjunction with a radio repeater network linking all clubs and services. This has enabled effective and efficient coordination of the state's clubs and services and 3,000 volunteers for any aquatic incidents. This future lifesaving repeater network was enabled using federal black spot funding. This three-year federal black spot drowning intervention program has contributed to a significant reduction in drowning across the nation, not just in Tassie, with figures coming down from 81 to 61 in the past two years through programs introduced by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Surf Life Saving Australia
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Tasmania unfortunately has one of Australia's highest drowning rates—3.5 per 100,000 people per annum—which highlights the need for further funding for continuation of appropriate drowning intervention programs in Australia. Being an island state, we have 1,269 accessible beaches, let alone other waterways and damns, and thousands of potential drowning areas.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally, this summer will see the launch of a purpose-built all-weather jet rescue boat on Tasmania's north-west coast, complementing existing police vessels in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head" rel="nofollow">
               Circular Head
              </a>
              and Devonport. The vessel is capable of shallow water and large surface rescue. The craft can be launched in very adverse conditions and is a welcome addition to our beautiful yet occasionally treacherous coast. Again, I thank all those members of Surf Life Saving Australia and Surf Life Saving Tasmania for volunteering their services and doing such a marvellous job. I thank the member for Bass for his abiding interest in surf-lifesaving matters Australia-wide in this parliament and in Tasmania.

               . There are a total of approximately 6,796 members of these clubs within the Point Danger Branch and these same members are also teaching local nippers in surf sports as well as training new members so that they have the necessary skills to be able to assist with all aspects of beach patrols. These members are part of one of the largest community volunteer organisations in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
               Recently, eight volunteers from clubs within the Point Danger Branch received awards at the Queensland annual awards dinner. I would like to congratulate Claudia and Sam Fien from Rainbow Bay, Jessica Attenborough from North Kirra, Marsha and Chris Maynard from Currumbin and Anthony Cassone from Kirra. I would especially like to congratulate Bev Walsh from Currumbin and Ray Fien from Rainbow Bay for also winning awards on the night and for being nominated for the national awards in October this year.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the concerns for surf-lifesaving clubs in general has been the decrease in the number of volunteers. However, the Point Danger Branch membership numbers remain strong and they are proud of the quality of lifesaving services that they provide. In addition to these services, the Point Danger Branch are continually looking at opportunities to get the local community involved. They are putting programs together that include School Surf Talk visits, youth development initiatives and programs aimed at attracting the retired community into surf lifesaving. The School Surf Talk program has been designed to educate primary and secondary students on surf safety and surf awareness. This program intends to educate around 4,500 Gold Coast students, including students from Caningeraba State School, Currumbin Valley State School, Currumbin Primary State School and

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the president of the Point Danger branch, Mal Barnes, along with the deputy president, Tony Wischnevsky, and the rest of their committee for their commitment to the local surf-lifesaving club. I would also like to thank Kerrie Barnes, who manages the branch, for keeping me up-to-date on the branch activities in the local community.
