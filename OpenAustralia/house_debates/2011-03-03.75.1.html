          <p>
           Today we have received the very important news that the Senate will support the temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy. I know it is strongly supported by all members on this side of the House and of course the Independents and minor parties in this House, and it will be supported by the Independents and minor parties in the Senate. What we have seen is terrible floods, terrible fires, and of course a terrible cyclone in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
            Far North Queensland
           </a>
           . We have seen devastation and we have seen very great need in our communities. That is why the government has worked with the Independents, the Greens and the minor parties to get support in place so we can get the reconstruction going.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today in data from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
            Bureau of Statistics
           </a>
           we have further evidence of the damage that has been done in Queensland. Both the trade figures today and the building approvals figures today show the size of the challenge that we face—in particular in rebuilding in Queensland. The damage has been great—damage of private property and personal possessions, and also public infrastructure. Under the disaster arrangements the Commonwealth is up for something like 75 per cent of most of the critical infrastructure, and we have come to this task with good faith, understanding the damage that has been done in North Queensland, in Far North Queensland, in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
            Central Queensland
           </a>
           , in western Queensland, in South-East Queensland, in Victoria, and by the fires in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           So the passage of this legislation is absolutely essential—because the government understands that we have to pay as we go. We do have to pay as we go; there is no free way of doing this. Those opposite simply do not understand the challenge of the economic task before us, nor do they understand the urgent need to rebuild in Queensland. What we have had with the Leader of the Opposition is all opposition and no leadership. Not only is he saying no to the rebuilding of Queensland and other parts of Australia through the flood levy—just like he said no during the global financial crisis, just like he says no to the
