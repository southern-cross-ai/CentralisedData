        Jodie's Inspiration is a newly created not-for-profit organisation whose aim is to raise funds for local health organisations, in particular the

        and

        </a>
        oncology units. This organisation, along with the founder, Jodie McCrae, a 42-year-old local Lismore businesswoman, has a very personal and courageous story behind it. In May 2013, Jodie was diagnosed with a rare aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer and was subsequently re-diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in 2014. After a round of treatment, doctors told her she was 'cancer free'. Unfortunately, it re-emerged and Jodie is now up to her fourth round of chemotherapy. This rare type of cancer can be treated but cannot be cured. The mother of two children, a son and a daughter, she is philosophical about her condition and lives under no illusion. But she is determined to help others with cancer. She decided to start Jodie's Inspiration as she wanted to help, both financially and emotionally, those people less fortunate than herself. The not-for-profit organisation is holding a fundraiser event at Trinity sports centre in Lismore on 31 October. It will raise money to buy medical equipment, including a cold-cap therapy machine, which prevents hair loss during chemo. Such is Jodie's belief in this machine that she has ordered it and says that, if the fundraiser falls short, she and her partner will cover the shortfall. Jodie, you are an inspiration. I encourage everyone to come along to this event on the 31st.
