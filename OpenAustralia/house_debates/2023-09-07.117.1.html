        GOODENOUGH (â€”) (): Today marks the 10th anniversary of my election as the member for Moore. During this time, I have successfully delivered major road funding for the extension and widening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Freeway
        </a>
        through the electorate and improved east-west road access by the construction of traffic bridges at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joondalup_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Joondalup Drive
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        . However, the job is still not done, and now is not the time to rest on one's laurels.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        at the Joondalup Business Association to secure the necessary road infrastructure funding to facilitate the future development of the northern part of Joondalup city centre. We need to plan ahead for the future infrastructure needs brought about by population growth and the development of our regional city centre to add vibrancy. At present,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenton_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Shenton Avenue
        </a>
        is one of the major access roads connecting the Mitchell Freeway and the Joondalup city centre. At peak times, Shenton Avenue is at full capacity as vehicles queue at the congested intersection of Shenton Avenue and Joondalup Drive seeking access to Lake Joondalup Baptist College during school drop-off times, the Winton Road business park,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeside_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         Lakeside Joondalup
        </a>
        shopping centre,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Boulevard" rel="nofollow">
         Grand Boulevard
        </a>
        and the Joondalup hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        Traffic engineers are considering plans to add extra lanes to Shenton Avenue, which will require widening the bridge over the railway line to accommodate increased volumes of traffic seeking to access Joondalup CBD. Alternative access routes are also required to more evenly distribute traffic flows into Joondalup from the Mitchell Freeway. At present, Moore Drive is the only major east-west road with no connection with the Mitchell Freeway. Federal road funding is required to construct entry and off-ramps at Moore Drive onto and from the Mitchell Freeway to improve northern access to our major sporting facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBF" rel="nofollow">
         HBF
        </a>
        Arena Joondalup, Lake Joondalup Baptist College, the residential areas of Currambine and Joondalup and Joondalup hospital, and facilitate future development of more than 10 hectares of vacant land in the northern precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        The construction of a roundabout at the intersection of Joondalup Drive and Lakeside Drive will also open up access to Joondalup hospital and the Joondalup Learning Precinct from the north, allowing residents exiting Joondalup city north to turn right more easily onto Joondalup Drive, providing access to Wanneroo and the Mitchell Freeway via
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_Beach_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Burns Beach Road
        </a>
        . Federal funding is essential to provide the necessary road infrastructure to facilitate the development of Joondalup city north. I call upon the Albanese government and the minister for infrastructure to provide the necessary funding in the upcoming federal budget.
