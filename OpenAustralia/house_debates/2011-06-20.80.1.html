        I rise today to talk about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_Zag" rel="nofollow">
         Zig Zag
        </a>
        scenic drive in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Kalamunda" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Kalamunda
        </a>
        . Situated in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gooseberry_Hill_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Gooseberry Hill National Park
        </a>
        , the Zig Zag offers great views of the Perth metropolitan area and is a popular tourist drive. Tens of thousands of people use this road every year. The area of the Zig Zag is historic and scenic. It attracts many families who live alongside it and helps to preserve the rich history that the area has to offer. There are also organised motor enthusiast and racing events held along the Zig Zag annually.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tranquillity and beauty of the Zig Zag is unfortunately spoilt by extreme cases of antisocial behaviour. I have received over 100 emails, calls and letters from residents who are fed up with hooning along this major tourist drive. Hoons are the not the only issue. There are broken glass, syringes, empty cans and bottles and other rubbish found along the road and throughout the bushland and car parks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this month, I organised a meeting of more than 40 local residents with myself, the WA state member for Kalamunda and the WA Minister for Planning, Culture, the Arts and Environment, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Day" rel="nofollow">

        , to talk through possible solutions to the problem. It is a critical one. Recently, a young man wrapped his car around a tree and nearly died while drag-racing along the Zig Zag. Concerned residents are fed up with the lack of action on the issue and came together to demand action from their local representatives. I will take up that fight for them. They and their children deserve to be safe in their own homes and when they drive along the Zig Zag track. John Day and I are committed to working with the people of Kalamunda and local stakeholders to find a solution to this problem. I find it hard to believe that in 2011 we are unable to preserve a beautiful tourist attraction whilst limiting drug taking, hooning and antisocial behaviour taking place in the evening. The same issue was picked up by the local newspaper and featured on their front page.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will continue to fight alongside the residents of the area to ensure that the Zig Zag becomes a safer area and road for tourists and residents. It is a beautiful track and it is based on the historic railway track that came down the

        </a>
        , hence the zig-zag factor. What I suppose disappoints me is that a scenic area of our state and a very rich area in terms of its views and fauna and flora is not respected by those who choose to demonstrate antisocial behaviour, which is not only a reflection on themselves but also a disappointment to those who value the area in which they live. I will continue to work with them to achieve a suitable solution that is beneficial for all.
