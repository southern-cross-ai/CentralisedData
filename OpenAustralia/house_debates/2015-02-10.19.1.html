       <p>
        While petrol prices have fallen in the last few months, there is still a clear difference between the costs at the pump in my electorate of Robertson when compared to service stations just 35 minutes down the road in Sydney. People on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        are paying up to 20c a litre more for their fuel than some Sydney residents, and it is just not fair.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why we have launched the Robertson petrol price petition, which calls on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        to select the Central Coast as a location to be investigated over fuel price disparity. The member for Dobell has also launched a petition to the ACCC on behalf of Central Coast residents, and I thank her for joining with me in this fight.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to report to the House that more than 800 residents and businesses in my electorate have already signed our petition. This includes the Central Coast Community Council, who co-launched the petition with me, and I want to thank regional development officer Ed McCarthy for his fantastic support in this fight. We have already handed over 800 signatures on the petition to Minister for

        , and I also thank the minister for his strong support for the Central Coast and for listening to small business owners at forum I held recently in

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There are around 30,000 commuters in my electorate, many of whom travel on the M1 every single day. It is time for some positive action. I urge people to sign the Robertson petrol price petition to help us fight for the spotlight to be shone on the Central Coast region in relation to fuel price disparity and for a fair go for our region.
