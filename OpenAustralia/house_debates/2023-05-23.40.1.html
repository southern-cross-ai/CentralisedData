        My question is to the Prime Minister. The words 'middle Australia' somehow made it into the budget talking points last week, but the problem is they were completely forgotten from the budget itself. The word 'infrastructure' didn't even make it into the talking points, let alone the Treasurer's speech. And now the Prime Minister is going to bring in a further 1.5 million people over five years at the same time he is cutting infrastructure and raising taxes.

         The time had expired, but there was a question just at the end about Labor again. I just remind members to put the question in before the 30-second mark. If there are some after that, that's okay, but the question needs to be in before the 30-second mark. The question needs to be in within 30 seconds.

          That mess of a question was messier than the last government. They actually workshop these things in a meeting, and come out and put it in writing, that word salad that I'm asked. To return to the issue of middle Australia and our commitments that we made, we promised that 1.2 million families would pay less for child care. Are we delivering that?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes, absolutely!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised that Australians would pay less for their medicine. Are we delivering that?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised to boost bulk-billing and to strengthen Medicare. Are we delivering that?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised to rebuild manufacturing and establish a National Reconstruction Fund. Are we delivering that?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes, absolutely!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised a royal commission on robodebt. And boy have we delivered that! We promised to increase the minimum wage. Was that delivered?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes, absolutely!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised to look after aged-care workers. Was that delivered?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised to lift wages. Was that delivered?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised to have climate change targets of 43 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Was that delivered?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes!
         </p>
         <p>
          We promised to have a safeguard mechanism. Has that been delivered?
         </p>
         <p>
          Government members: Yes!
         </p>
         <p>
          The truth is, we on this side did the hard work, in opposition, to develop policy to implement in government, policies deliberately aimed at middle Australia—to make a difference—after the wreck that we replaced, who were more concerned with themselves and, ever since the election, are more concerned with themselves still. The opposition leader, of course, has a meeting tomorrow. He may well not be here at two o'clock. I look forward to that.
