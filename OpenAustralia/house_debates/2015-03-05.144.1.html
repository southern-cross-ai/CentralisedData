       <p>
        Today I take the opportunity to present a petition, with the principal petitioner being my wife, and it relates to a national security and immigration related matter. Since November 2013, I have made several speeches in the parliament about the need to hold people to account for the oath that they make at citizenship ceremonies. When you look at what is going on in the national security sphere and the number of Australians that, unfortunately, have made the mistake of going overseas to fight for terrorists or military or extremist causes, it is important to hold them to account. So the proposal that I put through these speeches and that I put to the government was the need to be able to revoke the citizenship—the second citizenship—of those that have taken up such causes.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July last year, July 2014, I put together a motion to talk about this issue, and that was well supported by a number of people on both sides of the chamber. At the same time, I also put a petition on the front bench of my office and also briefly put it up on social media as well. As a result of that, 701 people around the country, mainly in my electorate, had signed the petition. Unfortunately, due to the enthusiasm and the lack of experience, a number had just signed a blank piece of paper without the description of the petition at the top, and unfortunately they were ruled out. In any case, I am very pleased to be able to present a petition of 631 signatures—official signatures—but there were originally 701. I thank those people from both the electorate of Cowan and elsewhere around the country for their view on this and for being prepared to put their name to such a motion as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, members of the House would know that on Monday of last week—Monday, 23 February—in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        's national security statement he determined that a number of policies would be adopted, and I am particularly pleased to see this proposal adopted as well. I do look forward to the technicalities and all the details being worked out so that this can be made law and again those people can be held to account.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will just remind the House that the petition said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That Australian Citizens have taken up arms for foreign military and extremist causes including, but not limited to, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        and by doing so they represent a threat to Australia and the safety of Australian citizens.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amend the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and take any and all action to allow the revocation of the status of Citizen for those who take up arms, provide material support for military/extremist causes or provide financial support for such causes, except where such action is at the direction or authorised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Government of Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        So I think that this is a perfectly reasonable and legitimate suggestion. I am very pleased that the government has taken it up. I once again thank everybody that has signed the petition. I would also just say again, as I have repeatedly reflected, that this should certainly apply not only to those that go away and take up arms or take up active support in foreign countries for these sorts of causes but also to those that take active steps, raising money or recruiting here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I endorse the petition. I present this petition to the chamber and thank everyone who has been involved with it.
