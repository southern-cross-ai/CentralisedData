       <p>
        In this last opportunity for 90-second statements, I rise to add to the theme of the member for Scullin and to congratulate the government on getting around to fulfilling at least one of their promises today. It has taken only nearly 20 months. We are finally getting some mobile black spot funding. I remember it being one of the key promises. How many of their promises have they actually delivered? For me and my electorate one of the most important things is jobs—jobs, jobs, jobs—and good jobs, as the Treasurer would call them. I distinctly remember reading the Real Solutions document. What did it say? It said:
       </p>
       <p>
        Our plan will deliver more jobs, higher real wages and better living standards for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alert! Wage growth is at its lowest in 17 years. No-one in my electorate believes you have delivered on that promise. No-one in my electorate believes that you are doing a good job.
       </p>
       <p>
        I echo the member for Scullin. Trust is now becoming a serious issue for this government. People no longer believe that they are going to deliver on the things that they said they were going to deliver on, and with good reason. Across the gamut—from education to health, pensions and the car industry—there is not a promise they made that they are likely to keep. The ramifications are starting to make their way into our electorates and into this economy.
