        Madam Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Education and Leader of the House, representing the Minister for Employment. I remind the minister that the House passed a motion yesterday apologising for the statement of the former member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, to the House on 21 May 2012. In light of bipartisan support for this motion, what further measures could be taken to better protect members against the misuse of union funds and union power?

         I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I do welcome the bipartisan support that the government received yesterday for its motion to apologise for the statement of the former member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, on 21 May 2012. Admittedly it was two years too late, but better late than never.

           that had existed around the former member for Dobell. But it presents the Leader of the Opposition with other tests that he needs to meet if he is going to prove that he is more than a union official representing union officials, that he runs a protection racket for protection rackets. Those tests are mounting up, like passing the Australian building and construction commission bill, passing the registered organisations commission bill, supporting the Royal commission into union governance and union corruption. He needs to pay back the $267,000 of

           members' money that Labor used to elect the former member for Dobell in 2007.
          </p>
          <p>
           And there is a new test that has been set for him today if he is going to show that he is a real leader and not just a union official representing union officials—that is, whether he will stand up to Senator Conroy in the Senate and make him apologise for the egregious remarks that he made yesterday to Lieutenant General Campbell. He attacked him and used him as a political football. The Leader of the Opposition said himself, on 23 January this year, 'I don't like seeing the Navy—

            Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. This takes direct relevance to an entirely new planet. There was nothing in the question that in any way relates to where the minister is now going. The beginning of the answer was directly relevant, no argument at all, but where he is now is completely unrelated.

              The reason it is relevant to the question is because Senator Conroy is a well-known union organiser from way back. He cut his teeth as a union organiser, and the question is about union power and the misuse of it.
