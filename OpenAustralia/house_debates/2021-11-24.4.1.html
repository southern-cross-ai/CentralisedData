       <p class="italic">
        (b) with so few bulk-billing doctors in Newcastle and the Hunter region, any further loss of services will have a huge impact on families already faced with high out-of-pocket healthcare costs;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) reverse cuts to bulk-billing incentive payments in the Lower Hunter that have seen GP practices close and vulnerable people left without access to a bulk-billing GP;

        (b) when the GPEI commenced, more than 350,000 cases of polio paralysed and killed children in 125 countries annually;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) in 2021, polio is 99 per cent eradicated and wild polio remains in only two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the entire African continent certified as polio-free on 25 August 2020;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) this success has been driven by the GPEl's extensive worldwide community-driven vaccination program, the largest of its kind in the world, to safeguard children from polio worldwide;

       <p class="italic">
        (e) safe and effective polio vaccines have been the single most important factor in achieving 99 per cent eradication of polio so far;

        (g) 2022 will be a critical year for polio eradication as the GPEI sets out its strategy to achieve polio eradication by 2026, and that this will be a key opportunity for Australian leadership; and

        (b) progress made toward polio eradication is facing new challenges with the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan impeding vaccination efforts and increasing the risk of new polio outbreaks;

        (c) travel agents, which have been in effective lockdown for over 600 days and will not be back to full capacity until after March 2022; and
