       <p>
        I rise tonight to address the House about a very successful partnership in the electorate of Wakefield, and that partnership is between the people of Wakefield, the local governments in Wakefield and me as the federal member. Often there is a lot of cynicism and people say it is just a blame game in which state, local and federal governments like to blame each other and nothing gets done. But with respect to roads, there is a good-news story in Wakefield that I would like to relay to the House because I am keen to see some of the programs that run under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
         AusLink
        </a>
        program continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        AusLink is the national program that looks at transport strategies, and for the first time this government has provided a framework for state governments, local governments, the Australian government and other stakeholders such as transport groups, industry and local residents to work together on strategic planning and funding for our road and rail networks. As well as that, there are a number of specific programs such as black spot programs to fix up danger spots on the roads, Roads to Recovery, strategic regional programs and specific funding to the states for maintenance. Many people, for example, do not realise that over the five years to 2008-09 there is some $1.5 billion paid by the Australian government to the state governments purely to maintain AusLink roads. When people see a national road that needs work, for example the Gawler bypass and some of the deep cracking on that, they should be aware that we actually fund the state governments specifically for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program I want to talk about specifically today is Roads to Recovery. When I meet with people at train stations and shopping centres at Munno Para, Elizabeth, Craigmore and country towns, and through surveys, I get much feedback about issues they have with roads. My encouragement to people is to continue to give me that feedback and also very specific examples of where the roads have problems. Over the last two and a bit years I have developed a good relationship with local government whereby I can communicate with them and get good feedback from them about spots on the roads—and even footpaths—that need fixing. As that information comes to me I pass it onto the councils so the councils can factor it into their priorities for fixing roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        The part where the Australian government comes into play is through the funding that we give through Roads to Recovery. This is a very good partnership between the Australian government and local government where we give them funding directly so that they can make a real difference in local communities. For example, some $2.8 million is going to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Light Regional Council
        </a>
        in Wakefield to fix roads like Roseworthy Road West, with $334,000 on that, and the bridge over the River Light on the Bethel Road at Kapunda, with some $250,000 for that. Annie Terrace in Wasleys and Cliff Road and Flett Road in Roseworthy are all done under Roads to Recovery. In Gawler, some $1.2 million has been given for work including on Holmes Street, at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Sheriff Street
        </a>
        and Millers Road and on Water Lane and Light Square. All of these have been fixed locally by the local government with money from the Australian government. Many of the projects have been in response to things that have been highlighted by the residents of Wakefield.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Playford, some $4.4 million has been allocated on roads such as Medlow Road, Clark Road from Penfield Road through to Virginia, and Craigmore Road. There has been quite a deal of activity just near my electorate office over the last month or so to increase the pavement depth—some $720,000 on that. These funds from the Australian government are allocated to help local government fix the problems that people in Playford have identified.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Salisbury, over $2 million has been spent on roads like Helps Road from Diment Road to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Edinburgh Road
        </a>
        in Direk. Up in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefield_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Wakefield Regional Council
        </a>
        there is the Nantawarra Road and Wharf Crescent in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Wakefield" rel="nofollow">
         Port Wakefield
        </a>
        . Some $1.2 million has been allocated all up to the Wakefield Regional Council. In Mallala, $1.1 million has been allocated to look at things like Ruskin Road and Gawler River Road at Lewiston. Some $156,000 has gone specifically on the Gawler River Road. That work is starting this month and is due to be finished by June this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Clare and Gilbert Valley Councils, $1.7 million has been allocated to fix things like the Auburn-Manoora Road and Bates Hill Road at Hilltown, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Road" rel="nofollow">
         New Road
        </a>
        from Hartley Road to the intersection of Farrell Flat Road—work to realign and reconstruct that. That work started in January this year and will finish in April. Some $122,000 has been allocated for that. What you see here is a good example of an effective partnership that is working in the seat of Wakefield.
