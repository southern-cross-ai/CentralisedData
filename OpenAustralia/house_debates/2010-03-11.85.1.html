        Earlier in this term I spoke about a vision for a walking and cycling trail around Geelong’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corio_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Corio Bay
        </a>
        . This trail would extend from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Park
        </a>
        through the city’s waterfront along the western and northern shores to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limeburners_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Limeburners Bay
        </a>
        in Corio. It is a big plan. It would open up a nine-kilometre stretch of foreshore that is presently accessible only in sections. It involves skirting around and through some of the busiest sections of Geelong’s industrial heart, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         Port of Geelong
        </a>
        . But I believe it can and should be done. The western arm of Corio Bay boasts beautiful stretches of shoreline, and the view of Geelong from this vantage is one of its best. A cycling and walking trail will create a wonderful community asset for locals and tourists alike. It would also link to the bike path that already runs from Limeburners Bay to Lara and establish a seamless connection between the CBD and Geelong’s north. This plan would open up and improve access to the bay for people who live in the northern suburbs, creating a safe and scenic recreational route to the bay which is currently denied. It would also be a commuter path for those who live and work nearby. For example, people in Lara who work in Geelong’s CBD could cycle to work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any community facility that increases options people have to pursue a healthy lifestyle is in my opinion a winner. I am delighted to say that progress has been made during the past few months on this initiative. Meetings between me, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        and various landholders have been held to canvass the possibilities and the challenges we face. The biggest issue is how we get around sensitive areas like the port, where security and safety are the primary concern. There are legitimate concerns about intermingling of pedestrians and cyclists in areas of heavy industry. Commercial operations cannot be compromised and safety for all must be paramount. This will require innovative engineering solutions in some sections. Pedestrian bridges, tunnels, flyovers and boardwalks are issues that need further consultation with all stakeholders involved, especially industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once we have a clear idea of the solutions available and what solutions stakeholders would accept, we will be in a position to develop a concept plan that can be costed and that will guide the best route available. There are clearly issues that need to be worked through, but what has been great to see is the positive response to the concept of a cycling and walking path around Corio Bay.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        of Greater Geelong have been very helpful in taking this initiative forward and I thank them. Industry has been prepared to attend meetings, look at the options and discuss the issues, which I really appreciate. This is a long-term plan but it is a plan that in my view has enormous merit. Our north-facing bay is a world-class asset, but in some stretches it is also a hidden treasure. My aim is to see this hidden treasure, which is after all the very reason Geelong was established as a settlement in the first place, opened up so that Corio Bay can be enjoyed by all.
