         <p>
          It has been a big two years of delivering for the people of Higgins, and I'm only just getting started. Since my election to this place I've been determined to see the commitments I made to the people of Higgins delivered in full despite the massive impact of COVID. I'm getting on with the job of taking care of Higgins.
         </p>
         <p>
          No project speaks to this more than the brand-new headspace facility that will be opening its doors in Higgins very soon. It is important that people experiencing mental health challenges receive support as early as possible to help them stay on track, and this has never been more important than during COVID. One in four people aged 16 to 24 experience some form of mental ill health every year, and three-quarters of all mental health illness manifests in people under the age of 25. Each headspace is tailored to the needs of the local community. I know that the new service coming to Malvern has been selected with input from key service providers led by Alfred Health. I was proud to be on the panel that has been dealing with this. This new headspace was made possible by a $3.5 million commitment from the Commonwealth government. It's right in the heart of Malvern, close to shops, public transport and educational facilities and services, and it's expected to open early in 2022.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am also pleased to say that earlier this year the Minister for Health, the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
           Greg Hunt
          </a>
          , opened the new state-of-the-art Cabrini Cancer Institute, made possible with $6 million in Commonwealth funding. This incredible facility brings together all aspects of cancer research and services right in the heart of Higgins. As the only hospital in my electorate, this funding will provide researchers and clinicians, and enable them to work towards life-saving breakthroughs for cancer. As a former doctor of Cabrini Health and as someone who is on the board of the hospital, I know the outstanding work this institute undertakes each day for clinical care and for those with cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Continuing this theme, I'm very much looking forward to visiting the site of the new hospice for very special kids in Malvern. The sod-turning will commence the complete rebuild of one of Australia's only children's hospices, which is made possible with a $7.5 million commitment by the Morrison government. This rebuild will provide a beautiful private space for families to spend their final days with their child supported by expert and loving care. It is truly 'angels taking care of little angels'.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another key local health project coming to Higgins is the residential eating disorder treatment centre in Armadale. This government has provided the $13 million needed to provide this important facility. As we know, one million Australians are thought to suffer from some form of eating disorder. Locally, referrals for eating disorders have doubled in the last 12 months because of the rolling lockdowns in Victoria and the global COVID pandemic. Treatment requires intensive wraparound support, and residential centres like the one coming to Higgins are essential to delivering this care for our great state of Victoria.
         </p>
         <p>
          As lockdown in Victoria lifts, locals in Murrumbeena are gearing up for the 2022 season. The highly anticipated new Murrumbeena Community Hub is nearing completion thanks to a $4 million contribution from the Morrison government. I know how excited the local community groups are to have more changing rooms and a new 140-seat function room with verandas for viewing sports in action. The facilities will be used by Murrumbeena Football Netball Club, Murrumbeena Junior Football Club, Murrumbeena Cricket Club, Murrumbeena Bowls Club and Oakdale Angling Club. This is a very highly anticipated new community hub.
         </p>
         <p>
          Finally, I want to use this opportunity to once again place on record this government's commitment to seeing the dangerous and congested level crossing at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenferrie_Road" rel="nofollow">

          in Kooyong removed. We have delivered $8 million for the business case to assess the removal of this crossing, but the Victorian state government has not yet released the findings. I call on them again to release the business case. Locals are desperate to know the options for removal of this level crossing and want to get rid of this dangerous and congested level crossing. While it's been tough for Higgins through COVID, much has been delivered for my community. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with, and for, my community and being part of the Morrison government, which gets on with the job of helping to deliver an even better place to live, work and raise a family. I am proud to be the member for Higgins and proud to be taking care of Higgins.
