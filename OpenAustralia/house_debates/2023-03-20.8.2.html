        and the Prime Minister for working to deliver for New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the Albanese Labor government's $3 billion in funding in the 2022 October budget for the infrastructure that the residents of New South Wales need and the infrastructure that the residents of New South Wales deserve. Take my home town, the Central Coast in New South Wales. Our road network has been neglected for quite some time. It's been neglected for the past 10 years. What does that mean? That means that there have been significant social, employment and health impacts. It's not just infrastructure—it's not just bitumen; it's not just bricks; it's not just mortar. It's about building the foundations of our society and of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we have congested road networks and roads that are falling apart and aren't well maintained, this impacts the ability of an ambulance to reach a patient and then transport them to hospital. It impacts the fire truck getting to the scene of that bushfire, to make a difference—to save lives and save property. It stops the police responding to a call involving domestic violence. It stops parents picking up their kids from school. It means that working people are stuck in traffic rather than (1) being at their place of work or (2) spending time with their loved ones and family. This isn't limited to the Central Coast. This is a widespread issue throughout New South Wales. I look at places like the Hunter, the Blue Mountains, Western Sydney and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        . All of these places are going to benefit from the commitment made by the Albanese Labor government in the last budget, and they will continue to benefit under an Albanese Labor government into the future. We need repair and renewal of our infrastructure, and that is exactly what we're doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was not only a major issue during the election; it's a major issue now. It's our infrastructure. It's the bricks and the mortar. It's what's building our community. We need to keep pace with the growing population in our regional centres and city centres. It's absolutely vital that we keep pace. These projects will grow our regions. They're going to support our regions. They're going to provide our people with the infrastructure and support that they so desperately need and so desperately deserve. The Australian government, the Albanese Labor government, is committed to investing in the right infrastructure projects that support New South Wales's growing cities and regions and that are underpinned by strong supportive evidence and demonstrated value for money.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will give you a few examples of how this is going to benefit and impact my community. I'm talking about the significant upgrade at Avoca Drive, through Kincumber. This is a significant pinch point in my community, with significant traffic. We're talking about parents with kids being stuck in that traffic. We're talking about ambulances not being able to pass. We're talking about significant safety issues for pedestrians and people riding bicycles. It's the missing link that connects our centres on the Central Coast to our regional coastal villages like Avoca, Saratoga, Davistown, Erina and Gosford. All of those places are impacted because we did not get the infrastructure that we needed in the past decade. But I'm proud that our government, the Albanese Labor government, is investing heavily in regional roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also look at the millions in investment that we are providing in our local roads. These local roads aren't just small roads; they're large roads that connect the major arterials that are used by our residents, right across the Central Coast. Those roads have been neglected and forgotten for so long. As a local who grew up in Umina, on the southern end of the Central Coast, I'm so proud and pleased that I'm part of a team on this side of the House that's getting behind New South Wales regional and metropolitan infrastructure. It is so important that we connect our community. It's so important that New South Wales gets the infrastructure that it needs and deserves.

          </small>
          <p>
           The motion moved by the new member for Robertson is a collection of half-truths, highly misleading statements and deliberate omissions about the coalition's infrastructure track record. The most egregious of those concern the claims that are made in relation to funding for roads on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Central Coast
           </a>
           , because the motion refers to $40 million of funding for Central Coast roads in the October budget. I think it's important that the House should be fully acquainted with the facts.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first relevant fact is that the former coalition government committed to an $86.5 million Central Coast roads package. This was fully funded, and the funding was fully allocated. There was a funding profile which extended over several years, with the final component of this total package to be provided in the 2026-27 year. That was the starting point. Then, on 11 May, the coalition committed to a further package of $40 million to improve the safety and quality of roads in the Central Coast region. Roads to be upgraded under this package include Hue Hue Road, Jilliby; Alison Road, Wyong; The Scenic Road at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacMasters_Beach" rel="nofollow">
            MacMasters Beach
           </a>
           ; Davistown Road at Saratoga and Davistown; Rickard Road,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Bay" rel="nofollow">
            Empire Bay
           </a>
           ; Lakedge Avenue,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Vale" rel="nofollow">
            Berkeley Vale
           </a>
           ; Peats Ridge Road, Somersby; and Cape Three Points Road,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoca_Beach" rel="nofollow">
            Avoca Beach
           </a>
           . The funding was to be provided to local government in the region to support its roadworks program. Again I emphasise that this was in addition to the $86.5 million already committed and budgeted.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 13 May, two days later, the Labor Party matched the coalition's $40 million Central Coast roads package election policy. In Labor's announcement, the then Labor candidate—and now Labor member—for Robertson, had this to say: 'This $40 million investment will also ease congestion and save locals from damaging their cars because of crater-sized potholes on our roads.' What he should have said was: 'We are committing to this funding for one reason only—because the Liberal member for Robertson, Lucy Wicks, fought hard to get this money and Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Frydenberg agreed to it, and now I'm coming along to free ride on all of Lucy Wicks's hard work.' If the member for Robertson had been into giving full disclosure to his soon-to-be constituents, that is what he would have said.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the story does not end there. We need to look at what the Albanese Labor government did in the October budget. On the one hand, yes, it's true: the Albanese Labor government delivered on the coalition's election promise for a $40 million Central Coast roads package—the package that they scrambled to match during the election. But they did something else. They cut $35.7 million from the pre-existing Central Coast roads package, cancelling proposed upgrades to Rawson Road and Springwood Street. It doesn't stop there; it gets worse. In addition, they deferred by two years $13.9 million originally budgeted for 2022-23 and $18.2 million budgeted from 2023-24, under the pre-existing Central Coast roads package.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the Labor member for Robertson were to be honest with his constituents, he would tell him that, on his watch, the net funding change for Central Coast roads across those two years—2022-23 and 2023-24—was minus $37.8 million because, while he might have got an extra $40 million for Central Coast roads, he stood by and did nothing while $67.8 million was taken away or deferred. This Labor member for Robertson is a mug. He got completely conned by a Victorian based minister for infrastructure and a Queensland based Treasurer. I tell you what: Lucy Wicks would never have fallen for this pea-and-thimble trick.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is a proud coalition legacy of investments to benefit the Central Coast, with $1 billion funded in the March 2022-23 budget for the Tuggerah to Wyong faster rail upgrade and $336 million to upgrade the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Pacific Highway
           </a>
           through Wyong. Also, in the March 2022 budget, there is $51.2 million to upgrade the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Central Coast Highway
           </a>
           and Tumbi Road intersection, which is a project Labor have delayed in the October 2022 budget—a very familiar story—and more than $35 million committed to Central Coast council under the Roads to Recovery Program and the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. Our government delivered for the Central Coast, and Lucy Wicks was a great member. The current member is not up to it.

           <p>
            I'm quite outraged by the comments from the member for Bradfield. The new suburb around Western
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
             Sydney Airport
            </a>
            —guess what they've called it? They're so original: 'Bradfield'. In spite of people wanting an Aboriginal name, an Indigenous name, what did the last government do? They called it 'Bradfield'. That's how clever they are. The only mug in the building today is the member for Bradfield. Ask him about the rail link to Western Sydney Airport from the most rapidly growing area of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            , my electorate of Macarthur. The last government turned away from the electors in my electorate. They did not give them a public transport link to Western Sydney Airport, and yet they're providing a link—no business case required—to the north, to the electorate of Lindsay. It's a shame, completely political, biased and another sign of the terrible infrastructure basis that the previous government worked on. It was all about the politics, not about the need.
           </p>
           <p>
            I congratulate my friend the member for Robertson for moving this motion. We live in very uncertain economic times. Our government, the Albanese government, acknowledges the importance of good, responsible infrastructure developments. That's why, in the October budget, our government committed to $3 billion in infrastructure projects in New South Wales this financial year and almost $15 billion over the forward estimates. This is important as we've had, particularly in the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney and in country areas, neglect from the New South Wales Liberal government and the previous Liberal-National government nationally. Macarthur's a fine example of this neglect, as are the surrounding electorates of Werriwa and Hume, with the electorate of Hume being woefully represented by the shadow Treasurer. I often hear from residents of Hume that they're not happy with their lack of representation and the lack of infrastructure in their areas. It's a real issue for these three electorates and for many others around New South Wales.
           </p>
           <p>
            One example of this is the lack of early education investment in the new, developing areas of Macarthur. We're the biggest electorate in the country by population, yet we have a lack of schools, a lack of infrastructure for public transport, a lack of hospitals and a lack of health care. Previous governments, state and federal, have done very little. I recently went to a preschool, Goodstart Early Learning, in Willowdale, which used to be a farm. It's now a rapidly increasing suburb, and the preschool there has over 900 families on the waiting list. That often means that both parents can't work, that children are spending time at private child care and that people are childminding in their homes. It's just a sign of lack of infrastructure spending by previous state and federal Liberal governments. They're not small issues. They are important for our national productivity and important for how we are going to manage the future, which is an increasingly challenging one.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have some wonderful companies in Macarthur. I've visited places like Woolstar, who make high-quality Australian quilts, blankets and bedding from wool. They've been in Ingleburn for over 25 years and have a thriving business. But their workers need to get to work, and there's very little public transport. They need better infrastructure if they're going to export more of their products. Another fine example is DECO group, which is in Minto and is led by its founder, Ross Doonan. It produces very high-technology advanced coatings and membranes for architectural, signage and other needs, including in the health industry. We have wonderful businesses, but they need to be supported by infrastructure.

            I'm sorry to say that previous state and federal governments—Liberal governments—have not provided the infrastructure that my constituents need. Even around Macarthur station, the state and federal Liberal governments argued about a commuter car park. They promised one but it has never been delivered. For the Western Sydney Airport, we need a heavy rail link from Leppington to take freight from the Moorebank Intermodal to the airport and to connect Western Sydney Airport with Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. The previous government turned their backs on us. It's just terrible, what they've done. The most rapidly growing area failed to get public transport links from the previous government. Our government, through

            <p>
             I'd first like to acknowledge my Western Sydney colleague the member for Macarthur and his passion for Western Sydney. But I feel on this occasion it's a little bit misplaced because on the other side of Western Sydney I am now waiting for those commitments the Labor government made during the last election, with no delivery in sight, and I'd like to thank the member for Robertson for bringing this motion to the House today because it enables me to speak about these commitments the Labor government made to my community that we are now waiting for. There were some interjections earlier when the member for Bradfield was talking about 'all announcements and no delivery from those opposite'—well, that would be amusing if it wasn't actually extremely true in Western Sydney.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the 2019 election I fought really hard for the upgrade to Dunheved Road in my community, and this upgrade has been needed for so long. I achieved half the amount that was needed so I went back to the Commonwealth and fought for some more, and at the 2022 election the Labor candidate and the Labor Party committed to fast-tracking this project. We are now a year into the Albanese government, and I would like to know what the Prime Minister's interpretation of fast-tracking a project is, because we are not fast-tracking. I'm still waiting to hear from the council about when this project will start, if in fact fast-tracking happens—typical Labor announcing something and not delivering for my people in Western Sydney, just like committing to a Medicare urgent care clinic during this election, by this May, for Lindsay, yet this won't happen on time either. It may have even been delayed to the end of the year, as we heard in Senate estimates. So already from the last election we have one election commitment that we know nothing about, we have heard nothing about, from the Albanese government and another one that has been delayed months and months.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another example is the $264.9 million that has been delayed for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Metro" rel="nofollow">
              Sydney Metro
             </a>
             project as part of the new Western Sydney international airport. It's interesting that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             Labor want to cut additional Sydney Metro corridors for Western Sydney, and it seems like their colleagues in the federal Labor Party want to do the same. So I'm asking the question on behalf of my community: what does this Labor government have against public transport for people in Western Sydney and particularly my area of Western Sydney? Another delay that will impact my community is the $3 million that was committed for Werrington Arterial Stage 2 planning. There is absolutely no indication where this is at. Even searching on the website there are no start and finish times for this project, so again we're waiting. A commitment has been made, $3 million from the federal government and also the state, and we're waiting for that to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The motion notes the Castlereagh corridor, which actually runs through my electorate of Lindsay, and again this was an election commitment. So this is election commitment 3 from the 2022 election we're waiting on, and we're not hearing anything about this Castlereagh corridor. Unfortunately the department's website says start and end dates are yet to be decided. So we have Dunheved Road fast-tracking, no fast-tracking; we have the Medicare urgent care clinic being delayed; and we have no information on yet another election commitment, the Castlereagh corridor, which runs through my electorate.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Treasurer's first budget, in October, was an absolute dud for the people of New South Wales on transport infrastructure: $2.3 billion slashed from the infrastructure program over the forward estimates for projects across my home state, and around the country $4.7 billion cut from key programs to benefit small to large-scale projects that will allow importantly—and I know this because it happens in my electorate—people to get to work and home again. People in my community have to commute, and, when infrastructure projects are cut or delayed, this has a real impact on families that spend so much time commuting to work and home again. This is time they could be spending at home with their kids and having a better quality of life, so I ask the government: please come forward with further information on the projects you committed to for my community, the delays, and whether you're actually going to go through with them at all.

               New South Wales

              Liberals and ask them what's happening. Let's remember that so much of our funding goes to that state government, and, gee, I'm hoping that on Saturday we get a new state government in New South Wales, a Labor state government who'll be able to deliver on the things that people expect. In

               Greater Western Sydney
              </a>
              our infrastructure has been long neglected by state and federal Liberals, but under the Albanese government there's real money to get these key projects going. The new Richmond Bridge, with $400 million for the duplication of the bridge, follows the process we started in 2010. It's crucial that this project is done right so that the benefits are real, while reducing the negative impacts. I'll continue to support the community as the New South Wales government work through the design.
             </p>
             <p>
              The October budget contained an additional $11.2 million to upgrade local roads in the Hawkesbury and $12.5 million for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
               Blue Mountains
              </a>
              roads. This nearly $25 million package will be delivered through councils, and I look forward to working closely with them as they now proceed to do the roadworks. Plus, there was $300 million for the Western Sydney roads package, which has $50 million for planning and proprietary works for the Castlereagh Connection to Castlereagh Road, $37 million for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Road" rel="nofollow">
               Richmond Road
              </a>
              planning and $75 million for planning and early works in the north-west growth corridor, all of which have been long needed so that they bring improvements in connectivity and reduce congestion.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's a myriad of smaller projects through programs such as Roads to Recovery and black spots funding, but we're also moving on those longer-term, big projects, with making high-speed rail a priority. We've already passed the legislation to establish the High Speed Rail Authority, and the speed rail connections between Sydney, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
               Central Coast
              </a>
              and Newcastle are moving closer to reality via a $500 million investment to start corridor acquisition, planning and early works, all the stuff that has to happen to make these things land on the ground.
             </p>
             <p>
              The former government made promises without ever thinking about how to deliver them, often without talking to even the state or territory governments they'd later rely on and partner with. For years they pretended money was in the budget for zombie project—ridiculous. The Albanese government is ensuring the Commonwealth's infrastructure spending is responsible, affordable and sustainable, while making up for nearly a decade of waste and missed opportunities.

              The biggest piece of infrastructure impacting the Blue Mountains, in my electorate, is the Western Sydney airport. I hold very strong views about this airport, and my biggest concern is the effect of flight paths on the residents of the Blue Mountains region and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
               World Heritage
              </a>
              area. It's an area where the ambient noise levels are low, and even the current
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
               Sydney Airport
              </a>
              flight paths can cause annoyance. By the middle of the year we will see the planned flight paths, and I want to acknowledge the minister for infrastructure for being open about the planning process and recognising the strength of feeling on this, including from my constituents. There are a few things we do already know. We know that the Blaxland merge point is gone and any other single merge point is gone. We know that overflights of residential areas and noise-sensitive facilities will be avoided to the maximum extent possible. We know that airspace design will consider the impacts of air operations on natural and visually sensitive areas, and we know there is a requirement to minimise the impact of night-time aircraft operations.
             </p>
             <p>
              But we also know that this is a 24/7 airport and that the Blue Mountains will be subjected to additional aircraft noise. So, what can people expect? Well, when the preliminary flight path design is released, it will have a noise tool that will allow you to put in an address and see what the likely impact will be. I want people to really understand what lines on paper mean for us in real life, and this noise tool is vital for that. I expect wide discussion and, to be frank, concern when that is released. After that, there'll be the formal
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIS" rel="nofollow">
               EIS
              </a>
              process, specifically for the flight paths, which will contain additional detailed studies and information and to which people will have a chance to put in a formal submission.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government's commitment is that the time available to respond will be well beyond the statutory requirement. I'll be ensuring that information is widely shared as this progresses, but I'd urge people to be familiar with the new website that's been launched, wsiflightpaths.gov.au. That was released at the FoWSA meeting I attended on Saturday, and I want to thank people who were at that meeting or who submitted questions to it. The new website will tell you where you can attend public information stands. I'm really urging people to stay engaged. We need to make sure our voice is heard.

               McCORMACK () (): We have set the scene early. It's state election day this Saturday. Pre-polls opened on Saturday, just gone, and already Labor is out bashing the Perrottet-Toole government, saying they don't deserve to be re-elected, talking up Chris Minns, talking up Labor in the state. The last thing Australia needs is wall-to-wall red, wall-to-wall socialism! The last thing we need is to have a Labor government in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Street" rel="nofollow">
                Macquarie Street
               </a>
               and a Labor government in Canberra. That's what the voters of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               will get if the polls go that way this Saturday.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Perrottet-Toole government deserves to be re-elected. We should be concentrating on federal matters in the federal parliament. But Labor—in true, typical Labor style—will spend all of this week talking up Labor in New South Wales. They'll spend all week disguising the fact that energy prices are going up and up and up on their watch. They'll spend all week talking about everything but what they should be doing. There will be one little rider: they'll be taking credit for AUKUS. They'll be taking credit for the subs deal, which came about because of a coalition federal government.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm glad that the shadow defence minister is at the table, because all of that Defence spending, all of those measures and the new pact between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, came about on the coalition's watch, as you'd expect it would. I'm also glad that the member for Eden-Monaro is at the table. When it comes to infrastructure in New South Wales and the black spot program for mobile phones, she did very well—she's nodding; she knows she did very well—yet 25 out of 26 of those mobile phone towers went to Labor seats. Talk about disingenuous! Talk about hypocritical! It is writ large with those opposite.

                   Indeed I am, thank you. It is an absolute abomination that no National Party seat received a mobile black spot tower in the latest round, which was said to be an election commitment round. But it was not described as that. It was described as an 'improving mobile phone coverage' around. If it's securing better mobile coverage, some of that money, some of those towers, should have gone to National Party seats, because we hold the majority of the landmass in

                   The member for Robertson comes to this place, with this private member's bill, talking about neglect. There was no neglect when the coalition was in power. There was $120 billion of infrastructure supporting 110,000 or so jobs. That is delivery. If we want to talk about delivery and we want to talk about New South Wales, let's talk about

                   </a>
                   , the New South Wales water spokesperson who, not that long ago, when asked if a future potential Labor government in New South Wales supported raising the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyangala_Dam" rel="nofollow">

                   wall, said, 'Never mind increasing the dam wall; let's just improve the roads out of Forbes so people can escape quicker.' That is disgraceful. That is disgusting to regional people who have been flooded out six times, at least, in the last 12 years. Here they were, knee-deep—in some places even higher—in floodwater, and you've got the person who will potentially be the minister looking after water and possibly even infrastructure in a future Minns Labor government—it'll be coerced by the Greens, of course, as Labor always are; they are always bedmates with the Greens—talking about making better escape routes, rather than raising a vital piece of water infrastructure. That's the Labor way. They don't care about regional areas. They don't care about infrastructure in country towns and country districts, which provide the food and fibre for this nation and will continue to do that despite what Labor may say or do.

                   So the best those voters in New South Wales—seeing that we're going to be spending a lot of time talking about it—can do is to re-elect a Liberal-Nationals government and get Sam Farraway continuing to create road infrastructure in New South Wales.

                    this financial year and $14.9 billion into the future. I've proudly delivered billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in Gilmore through the local government areas of Kiama, the Shoalhaven and the Eurobodalla. From Minnamurra in the north to

                    in the south, I know how important our safe and reliable roads are, and I want to make sure that roads support the needs of local people now and into the future. I have driven on these roads my whole life, and I know how important they are.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Before we were in government, and since we came into government, I have called for more funding for our

                    </a>
                    . Anyone who has driven north or south through Nowra knows how necessary this is. Bottlenecks hold tourists up and frustrate locals no end, which is why I was so pleased to recently join with my community and walk over the new
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowra_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
                     Nowra Bridge
                    </a>
                    for the official opening to traffic. It had $155 million in funding from the federal government and $155 million from the state government, something I am incredibly proud of.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But it's not going to stop at the Nowra Bridge. My eyes for some time have been on new projects, like the Nowra bypass. This critical piece of infrastructure should already have been underway, but, with the Liberals dragging their feet every step of the way, the Albanese Labor government have had to pick up the slack. The Albanese Labor government have put forward $97 million in federal funding to get the Nowra bypass going. That's $97 million out of a total of $105 million. That shows our commitment to getting infrastructure moving and, by extension, shows the Liberals' unwillingness to come to the table with any meaningful budgeted contribution—yes, not one cent. We need to get the Nowra bypass started now, and I am proud to be making that happen.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In another win before the election—and this has been delivered in the budget—I was absolutely thrilled to be able to announce the Albanese Labor government's $40 million investment in local Shoalhaven roads. This money will help

                    of Shoalhaven City Council, Stephen Dunshea, who told me happily that the agreement for the $40 million to fix our roads in the Shoalhaven has been received. He told me that the money is being delivered exactly as council has requested that it be delivered. That's an amazing result—helping to fix our potholed roads and saving ratepayers money. Yes, we've allocated $40 million to Shoalhaven City Council to fix local roads, and we've tailored the delivery to best suit the needs of the council—simple as that. There are $40 million for local Shoalhaven roads, a completed Nowra Bridge and $97 million to get the Nowra bypass going, and that's just the start.

                    At the state level, Labor also delivers. Last week I joined Dr Michael Holland, who made a commitment that, under a Minns Labor government, there will be $1.5 million to improve the Tuross Head turn-off from the Princes Highway, a dangerous intersection that has long been neglected. Further north, South Coast candidate Liza Butler has been working tirelessly to address gaping holes left by years of Liberal Party neglect. Liza was integral in securing $12 million in state funding under a Minns Labor government for the much-needed East Nowra sub arterial road. This road will alleviate congestion for commuters and tourists alike—something the community has been crying out for.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    State and federal Labor understands the needs of our communities and is committed to achieving them. The Albanese Labor government is ensuring that Commonwealth infrastructure spending is responsible, affordable and sustainable. Labor's investments in infrastructure will not only improve the lives of local people but also create jobs and economic growth for the whole country. It's a sensible and pragmatic plan for the future, and I'm proud to be delivering it.

                     I rise to express my deep frustration and my anger on behalf of the people of Mackellar. We have a major arterial road in my electorate, the Wakehurst Parkway, that has been a cause of deep anger and frustration for the people of Mackellar for at least a couple of decades now. To put it mildly, we are fed up with the lack of action from successive governments, both state and federal, Liberal and Labor, that has happened repeatedly over decades. Our repeated calls and pleas by our community for this road to be upgraded have been ignored over and over again—firstly as a safe Liberal seat, and now because the Labor Party understand that this seat, in all likelihood, will never be one of theirs. We are not a priority. We are angry and we are fed up. Lives are at risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The northern part of the

                      Northern Beaches
                     </a>
                     is a narrow peninsula, so there are only a couple of options to commute to the city. For thousands, the Wakehurst Parkway is the only direct route to the city, Chatswood and the local hospital. This road winds its way through a forested valley. It crosses a river, and it is one lane each way and extremely narrow and dangerous in parts. Lives have been lost on this road.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This road is critical to the people of the Northern Beaches for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is a major artery for commuters to the city and to other urban areas. It is typically very congested during peak hour times, and it is used by thousands of people to get to work during the week and to get to sports on the weekend. Secondly, and probably most importantly, it is the direct route that leads to the Northern Beaches Hospital. To go an alternate way would add at least 30 minutes to a trip. Thirdly, the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                      New South Wales
                     </a>
                     academy of sport is located halfway along this road and there is no other access to this sporting precinct other than by the Wakehurst Parkway. This is where athletes and teams, many elite, of all persuasions, train daily. It is their only access to the track, the swimming pool, the hockey fields, the football fields, the sport and rec camps, the head offices, the specialist sports medicine and physio facilities and the gym, amongst other things.

                     is held there every Saturday. So it is entirely unacceptable that this road is closed due to flooding, on average, six to seven times a year—and sometimes for days on end. Again, lives are at risk because people's trips to the hospital are being extended in an untimely way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The $75 million the federal government promised during the previous term, prior to the election, was cancelled in the last budget, in October last year. I have spoken to the minister for infrastructure twice in person now about this issue, to explain the urgency that is required to act on this road as it has been neglected for so long. I have also met with the New South Wales state minister and roads minister and shadow roads minister to explain the situation and request further funding to rectify the flooding issue. The New South Wales state government has allocated $75 million but that money has been allocated for other road safety issues on this road and will not be provided for flood mitigation. The council have offered to work on the land that is adjacent to the road, which is council land, to do flood mitigation work on that area, but they have a $13 million shortfall to be able to perform something which is acceptable to the community and doesn't destroy too much of the environment. A mere $13 million to reduce the flooding risk from six to seven times a year to just once or twice every two years—a massive difference for a small amount of money. It would otherwise cost over $600 million to raise the road. I say to you: this is something that is very worthwhile for the minimum amount of money.

                     has recognised that this is a priority issue because it is for building resilience to climate change and because it is a major access road to the hospital. How many more lives must be lost for this government to act on what is a very important road in our community. And as I have said, people have been upset, frustrated and angry about this, and the lack of action on it, for decades. Thank you.
