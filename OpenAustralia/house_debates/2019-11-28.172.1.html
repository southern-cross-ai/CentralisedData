        I want to join with the member for Cowan in endorsing our young people. It's a pleasure today to rise and speak with pride about the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum. Established 18 years ago, the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum is a 2½-day program for year 11 students focused on the three core values of integrity, service and courage. It's been my privilege to have been president of the forum since 2008 and to have hosted every private and public school year 11 at

        for two days since that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month, of course, from 17 to 20 October, together with our

        Tristan Smith, we hosted 154 student leaders from 15 schools throughout the Mitchell electorate at Vision Valley. The participating schools include: Balkham Hills High, Castle Hill High, Crestwood High, Galston High, Hills Grammar, Kellyville High,

        Thank you to these schools and the principals who've been the mainstay of the forum since its inception and have been on board for the entire 20 years. I extend my thanks to the principals and parents of today who continue their schools' involvement and support for this excellent forum. This year's students brought with them an immeasurable energy, enthusiasm and passion and growth throughout the 2½ days which was incredible. I look forward to following their success back at their schools and within our wider local community
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank the dedicated volunteer team, consisting of over 70 leaders and committee members, who worked tirelessly throughout the year and over the 2½ days to support these students. The passion and commitment in developing the next generation of leaders is nothing short of admirable, and the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum would not be possible without them. These leaders are exceptional examples for the students and display the forum's values of service, integrity and courage in their daily lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the forum, students participated in team-building activities, small-group discussions, and community service projects at Aminya Aged Care and McCall Gardens residential accommodation for adult men with disability. During the community service projects, the students completed a range of activities with residents, including painting, washing residents' cars, gardening, musical performances and other important interactions. They interacted with residents, teaching them how to knit, dancing, playing snooker and lawn bowls, and assisting residents with their computers and their mobile phones.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students also had the opportunity to listen to some inspiring and immensely important speakers that we hear from every year. We get a great line-up every year. This year was Matt Kershaw; Heather Hawkins; Ronni Khan, CEO of OzHarvest, notably;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lee" rel="nofollow">
