       <p>
        Each year I conduct a literary competition for students in my electorate, and each year that I have held this competition I have been consistently impressed by the quality and the originality shown by our youth. The 2013 entrants continued that legacy, writing to the theme 'Why Australia is a great country'.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were two standout entries. Congratulations to Ashleigh Whatson, a year 6 student at Brisbane's All Hallows' School. Ashleigh took out first place with a moving essay that truly showed a maturity and a depth of understanding beyond her years. The judges were very impressed with Ashleigh's winning entry and with her ability to articulate her views in such a compassionate and insightful way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second prize went to former Hamilton State School student Jack Buckingham, who is now in year 5 at Windsor State School. His passionate tribute to Australia's culture, landscape and lifestyle struck a definitive chord with the judges. I commend both winners on their achievements.

        I was overwhelmed by the quality of the entries from across the Brisbane electorate and I commend each and every student who contributed. My thanks must go to former news presenter Marie-Louise Theile; Tony Koch, a
