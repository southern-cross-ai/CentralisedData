        I'm delighted again to see so many constituents in the Higgins community recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        2022 Honours List. This year, there were 18 award recipients from Higgins—men and women who have served our community with distinction and dedication; men and women who have given back to the community in a variety of ways. The honours list provides a great opportunity for all Australians to recognise the value of those people who go above and beyond to make a difference to all of our lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the many honour day awardees I would like to thank is my good friend Dr Alan Finkel
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        , who has been elevated to the

         Companion of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , a merit of the highest degree of service in Australia. Dr Finkel was honoured for eminent service to science through energy innovation and research infrastructure initiatives, to climate change policy, for his contribution to Australia's COVID-19 response, and to science and engineering education. It is no surprise I am standing here today to speak of Dr Alan Finkel AC's service to Australia. Alan commenced as Australia's

        and President of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. He also holds a PhD in electrical engineering from Monash.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alan led the amalgamation that formed the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">

        —coincidentally, my father-in-law,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Allen" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Allen
        </a>
        , also a Higgins constituent, was the chair of the board at the time. He has been chair of the Australian Centre of Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics and was director of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">

          Cosmos Magazine
         </a>
        </i>
        , which, in addition to magazine publishing, operates a secondary school science education program. He also established the Australian course in advanced neuroscience to train early career neuroscientists and is patron of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Science_Media_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Science Media Centre
        </a>
        . Quite simply, Dr Finkel is an extraordinary Australian.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also pleased to see a number of incredible medical professionals honoured for their important work, including Dr Andrew Cattermole AM for his significant service to dentistry, and Ms Helen Crowe AM for her significant service to neurology and oncology. She is a local nurse practitioner whose research and work with prostate cancer patients is remarkable. Dr Sharan Johnson AM was honoured for her significant service to community health for her work in occupational hygiene and with the Australian Safety and Health Professionals Association. I also want to thank and congratulate Professor Prudence Francis AM for her significant service to medical research in the field of oncology, and Associate Professor Leeanne Grigg AM for her significant service to cardiology. Professor Robert Power AM was honoured for his significant service to medicine in the field of international development and research. His leadership at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnet_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Burnet Institute
        </a>
        , right on the edge of Higgins, has led to better health outcomes right across the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted their outstanding contributions are improving the lives of those who suffer and for this to be celebrated in this way. This year's honours list also includes recognition for two sporting champions: cyclist Paige Greco
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        and rower Rosemary Popa OAM for service to sport for a gold medal at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Tokyo Olympics
        </a>
        . Higgins sure does produce some amazing and strong women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Higgins is also represented in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day Honours
        </a>
        list for significant service for intellectual property law granted to Mr John Downing AM and for the significant service to business and to the community awarded to Dr Alan Wein AM.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, Australian Police Medals were awarded to senior Sergeant Bradley Mason and Superintendent Sharon McKinnon as well as an Ambulance Service Medal to Ms Glennis Winter. I thank them for their service, in particular for keeping our community safe. I commend all of the Higgins residents and, indeed, all Australians represented in the Australia Day Honours List this year and express my deep appreciation for their important contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Service to the community is one of the things that is so central to the love and support that our community provides for us and the recognition that community is central to a good society. I am very proud of the fact that Higgins is recognising these wonderful individuals and the important contribution they have made. There are so many others in the community and I am very proud of the fact that we have a community Higgins award that is a warded for volunteers.
