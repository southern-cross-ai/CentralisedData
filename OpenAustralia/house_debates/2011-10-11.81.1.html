       <p>
        The House will consider the bills in detail in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 13 September. The bills will be taken together. The question is that the bills be agreed to. Any proposed amendments are to be moved now. It might suit the House if members with amendments are permitted to move them in one motion. The questions on any amendments will be deferred and there will be a general debate on all amendments. At the conclusion of consideration in detail, questions will be put on amendments to all bills except the Steel Transformation Plan Bill 2011. One question will be put on all government amendments, one question will then be put on all amendments moved by opposition members and any necessary questions will be put on amendments moved by other members. Any further questions necessary to complete the detail stage will then be put. One question will be put on any government amendments to the Steel Transformation Plan Bill 2011. One question will then be put on all amendments moved by opposition members and any necessary questions will be put on amendments moved by other members, followed by any further questions necessary to complete the detail stage.

         Amendments (1) to(10), (11), (14), (15), (18), (19) and (22) to (25) that appear on sheet 267 deal with issues associated with landfill waste. The Clean Energy Bill provides that landfill facilities with emissions of at least 10,000 tonnes but less than 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents will be covered by the carbon-pricing mechanism if they are within a prescribed distance of a designated large landfill facility with emissions of at least 25,000 tonnes. This provision was intended to address the risk of waste being diverted from large landfills to smaller neighbouring landfills. The government has decided to set the initial prescribed distance at zero so that operators of small landfills will not be liable on 1 July 2012 and for at least the first three years of the scheme. This will provide time to gather evidence rather than projections of waste diversion to smaller landfills and to have the prescribed distance rule reviewed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         Authority no later than 2015-16. Any future increases in the prescribed distance could bring additional small landfills into the mechanism for the first time. It is also possible that small landfills will become liable for the first time because another landfill within the prescribed distance will start to pass the 25,000-tonne threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments I have moved will reduce the regulatory uncertainty for landfill operators regarding the future operation of the prescribed distance rule. These amendments will ensure that, if the prescribed distance is increased following the review, small landfills brought into the carbon price mechanism will not be liable for emissions from waste deposited retrospectively. The small landfill will only be liable for emissions from the waste that is deposited in the financial year that coverage of the landfill commences and subsequent years. They will not face liabilities as a result of these factors beyond their control.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments also provide for legacy and exempt landfill emissions to be measured using the NGER determination under section 10 (3) of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act rather than regulations. Amendment (3) is a minor technical amendment which is consequential on the amendments in (1), (3) to (6) and (9) of sheet 257. Those amendments deal with situations where no person has clear operational control of a facility. Amendments (4) to (9), (12), (13), (16), (17), (20), (21) and (26) to (45) are technical amendments to ensure that natural gas liability works the same way whether or not the end user of the gas owned the gas. These amendments respond to comments made by some stakeholders during the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation. In some cases, gas is provided for use without transfer of ownership of the gas. For instance, the owner of a facility might buy gas for the facility and make it available for use at the facility without transferring ownership in the gas to the contracted operator of the facility.

        <p>
         Amendment (46) on sheet 267 is a technical amendment to the opt-in scheme to ensure that aviation fuel users can use the opt-in scheme as intended. The amendment seeks to clarify that fuel users may opt into the carbon-pricing mechanism, even if the user or another entity becomes entitled to a fuel tax credit after opting in. The amendment will ensure that the opt-in scheme operates as intended and will remove any doubt as to the validity of aviation fuel users. Amendments (47) and (48) on sheet 267 will allow local councils and other landfill operators to discharge a larger proportion of their emissions using eligible
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFI" rel="nofollow">
          CFI
         </a>
         credits than currently permitted during the fixed price years of the carbon price mechanism. The surrender limit will be raised by these amendments from five per cent to 100 per cent of an operator's liability if the majority of liability is attributable to landfill emissions. The amendments are restricted to emitters in the landfill sector because they are in the unusual position of being able to generate CFI credits by implementing projects to capture legacy emissions at the same time as they have to surrender emissions units to discharge their liabilities. The added flexibility under these amendments will reduce the compliance burden on local councils and commercial landfill operators. Mr

           Sheet 257 deals with amendments to the Clean Energy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. Items (1), (3) to (6), (9) and (10) of sheet 257 bring forward the deadline for nominating a person with operational control of a facility from 31 August to 30 April. The basic provisions deal with situations where no single person has operational control of a facility and a person must be nominated from those who have some operational control. The items correct an oversight which meant that nominations would have been required after the provisional surrender obligation on 15 June. The amendment I am moving will allow the person who is going to be liable for emissions from the facility to register by 1 May and meet their progressive surrender obligations on 15 June of each charge year.
          </p>
          <p>
           Item (2) of sheet 257 clarifies that the measurement determination made under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act will be used to measure legacy emissions and exempt landfill emissions for the purposes of clauses 32 and 32A of the Clean Energy Bill. This is a technical amendment to ensure that all emissions from landfill facilities, including covered emissions, legacy emissions and exempt landfill emissions, are measured in accordance with a single consistent set of methods under the NGER Act.
          </p>
          <p>
           Items (7) and (8) of sheet 257 correct an error in proposed section 11B of the NGER Act. They ensure that liability applies to liable entities as defined in the Clean Energy Bill 2011, instead of controlling corporations as a result of a nomination.
          </p>
          <p>
           Items (11) and (12) of sheet 257 clarify the new provisions for refusing or suspending registration under the renewable energy target in light of the issues raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. In its current form the Clean Energy (Consequential Amendments) Bill includes an amendment that provides for the regulator to refuse or suspend the registration of persons under the renewable energy target legislation which enables them to create renewable energy certificates. This provision responds to stakeholder concerns around alleged unscrupulous conduct by agents selling certificates on behalf of owners and installers of small-scale renewable energy systems.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government is moving a further amendment to clarify that the additional powers to refuse or suspend registration of an entity under the renewable energy legislation are to be constrained to situations where the regulator is satisfied that the entity is not a fit and proper person. Regulations will prescribe matters to be considered by the regulator in determining whether or not the applicant or registered entity is a fit and proper person.
          </p>
          <p>
           Item (13) of sheet 257 provides that a transmission of Kyoto units by force of law is of no force until the units are registered in the account of the transferee. This amendment makes it clear that changes in title over Kyoto units must be effected through the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units so there is no ambiguity about legal ownership of units. There is similar provision for the transmission of carbon units, Australian carbon credit units and prescribed international units. This amendment ensures the same situation applies to Kyoto units.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sheet 269 amends the Clean Energy Regulator Bill 2011 to allow information to be shared with the Energy Security Council. Sheet 238 amends the Clean Energy (Household Assistance Amendments) Bill 2011 to clarify in legislation the government's policy in relation to residency for household assistance. Items (1) to (21) address inconsistencies in the drafting process.

           <p>
            I move opposition amendment (1) to the Clean Energy Bill 2011:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (1) Clause 2, page 1 (line 8) to page 5 (line 3), omit the clause, substitute:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            2 Commencement
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (1) The provisions of this Act commence on a date to be fixed by Proclamation.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (2) A Proclamation for the purposes of subsection (1) must not be made until after elections have been held for the 44th Parliament and the Parliament has met.
           </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of my amendment is to restore a measure of integrity to our tarnished democracy. It is to give members opposite a chance to make honest politicians of themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            What my amendment does is provide for the carbon tax package of measures to commence after the elections have been held for the 44th Parliament. My amendment says it will be up to the new government after the next election to decide whether or not to proclaim the carbon tax and whether or not the carbon tax will come into force. In other words, it will be up to the people of Australia, voting at an election, to determine the fate of the carbon tax—and that is as it should be. This tax is the biggest carbon tax in the world. This change is the biggest tax change in our history, and it should not come into force without first going to the people, asking them and getting their consent.
           </p>
           <p>
            A change as big as this should have a mandate. As is absolutely clear to this parliament and to all the people of this country, there is no mandate for what this government seeks to do now. If this parliament has a mandate for anything, it has a mandate not to introduce this tax. That is why the amendment that I am moving is so necessary if democratic integrity is to be restored to our system. As the Prime Minister is constantly reminded in this parliament, she said five days before the last election:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">

           <p>
            Let me repeat it for the benefit of the rather raucous member opposite. The Prime Minister said, five days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That was the commitment that the Prime Minister made on behalf of every single Labor member of this House.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Mr Mitchell
            <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">

            </a>
            —
           </p>
           <p>
            She made that commitment on their behalf and I am giving this parliament and those members, including the raucous member opposite, the chance to turn what would otherwise be a lie into a truth. I am giving members opposite the chance to turn a lie into a truth, to make honest politicians of the Prime Minister and themselves by deferring the actual proclamation of this carbon tax until after the next election. We had the member for Moreton today say very publicly that he was determined to keep faith with the people of Moreton by ensuring that the person they voted for as Prime Minister at the 2010 election stayed in that job. The amendment that I am moving now gives every member of parliament a chance to keep faith with their electorates. When the Prime Minister made that promise five days before the election she was not doing it as a private person and she was not doing it as just the member for Lalor; she was doing it as the Leader of the Labor Party; she was doing it as the leader of every member opposite. So if they want to keep faith with their electors they will support this amendment, because it is a contemptible thing for a government to say one thing before an election to win votes and do the opposite after the election to stay in power.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say to members opposite: if they want to stand up for truth in public life, if they want to stand up for the jobs of their constituents, if they want to stand up for truth-telling and if they want to ensure that the Labor Party really is the party of truth-telling, they will back this amendment. In the end, my amendment is not about whether you support a carbon tax—obviously I do not; some people in this parliament do—this is about whether you support democracy and whether you support integrity in public life. That is why this amendment should be supported by this parliament.

            <p>
             My strong opposition to the carbon tax will not prevent me from representing my electorate and therefore I will try to make improvements to this flawed. tax.    One of the most consistent and specific complaints I have heard in my electorate concerns the government's Clean Energy (Fuel Tax Legislation Amendment) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to place what is effectively a carbon price on every business in a non-exempted industry that uses transport fuel on site. This usually involves the use of diesel fuel in combustion engines for on-site power generation.
            </p>
            <p>
             This bill is not a just a tax on big polluters. On the contrary, it will affect thousands of small businesses, many of whom are in regional Australia and have no alternative but to use diesel fuel for power generation. I realised that my amendments were necessary following discussions with various constituents and industry representatives in my electorate. For example, one of my constituents, Helen, owns the Widgiemooltha Roadhouse and relies on diesel for on-site power generation to run both the roadhouse and attached accommodation facilities. Helen's small business will pay thousands of dollars for the carbon tax on fuel use. A small business such as Helen's is in no way a big polluter and should not be liable to pay the carbon price through reductions in diesel fuel rebates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other examples include the many junior miners and mineral exploration companies in my electorate. These explorers and junior miners rely on diesel fuel to operate. For many rural projects there is simply no viable alternative. These miners and explorers are in no way big polluters and should not be made to shoulder the carbon price. We should not be burdening our small businesses with further tax liabilities. Our small businesses should not be liable to pay a tax that was designed to be paid by big polluters.
            </p>
            <p>
             My amendments introduce a threshold under which low-polluting companies will not pay the carbon price. Under my amendments, if a business's taxable fuel use in a year has a carbon dioxide equivalent of less than 25,000 tonnes, their fuel tax credits will not be affected and they will not pay the carbon price. Carbon dioxide equivalence, in relation to taxable fuel, has the same meaning as in the government's Clean Energy Bill. In essence, these amendments ensure that only the big polluters will pay a carbon price on fuels. Under my amendments, low-polluting junior miners, mineral explorers, roadhouses and accommodation facilities will not be liable to pay the carbon price. These amendments hold the government to its promise that the carbon tax is only a tax on big polluters.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will not be supporting the government's carbon tax as it is one part of the government's triple assault on regional

             . I commend these amendments to the House as fair and reasonable amendments to the fuel rebate reforms. They are necessary amendments to protect small businesses in Australia.

              The government cannot support the amendments that have been moved by the opposition. What needs to be understood is that this is the culmination of a debate that has been running for almost two decades. We have seen 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994 and we have had a lot of discussion on these topics in this House already. This year alone, around 250 questions have been asked on carbon pricing and there have been over 15 separate debates on matters of public importance. The clean energy debate itself has taken 33 hours. It has featured 120 speakers, of course not including the member for Wentworth. He is the only frontbencher on the other side who has not contributed to this debate. Significantly, this has been a longer debate than the former, Howard government allowed for the

               GST

              , a longer debate than the former, Howard government allowed for

              </a>
              and a longer debate than the former, Howard government allowed for the legislation dealing with the sale of Telstra.
             </p>
             <p>
              The time to act is now. That is absolutely clear to those of us on this side of the House and those on the crossbenches who have already indicated their support for these bills. We must begin the transformation to a clean energy economy and a low-carbon economy. This transformation will begin with the passage of the clean energy bills. We must put in place incentives for business to invest in the clean energy technologies that will allow Australia to maintain its economic growth while cutting pollution. The countries that pioneer the clean technologies that will allow the decoupling of economic growth and growth of carbon pollution to occur will be the countries that see strong and consistent economic growth through the next century. These will be the countries that will be the most competitive, and the alternative is the Leader of the Opposition's prescription of doing nothing.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a prescription that pretends that climate change is not happening, and we heard that in many of the speeches that were given by those opposite. It is a prescription that, in effect, attacks the scientists who say that climate change is occurring. It attacks the economists who say that the carbon price is the most efficient way of tackling the problem. This, of course, is from the weathervane Leader of the Opposition, who once supported a price on carbon, and not so long ago. This weathervane Leader of the Opposition leads an opposition, about half of whom actually do support a price on carbon, but they are being prevented from expressing that view.
             </p>
             <p>
              By refusing to grapple with the challenges and opportunities of a carbon constrained world, the Leader of the Opposition would rather see our economy stagnate and fall behind the economies of our competitors as long as his political interests are served. Indeed, he would rather anything as long as his political interests are served. He does not care about the inconsistency with former positions. He does not care about the views expressed by economists. He does not care for the views expressed by scientists. He cares only for his own political interest, and now that the Leader of the Opposition has seen, now that it has been made clear to the Leader of the Opposition and to those opposite, that this important reform is not going to be able to be stopped, he seeks to delay it. Again, it portrays that the position of this Leader of the Opposition is to put his own political interests ahead of those of the nation.
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact is we know that any delay to this important reform, any delay to pricing carbon, will not somehow magically make it less costly. It will not reduce the effort that Australia will need to put in to reduce our carbon emissions. It will not reduce the effort that the world needs to put in to reduce world carbon emissions. It will only increase the costs when we get around to taking on the task. Various studies have looked at the implications of delaying the introduction of a carbon price. All conclude that delay will be costly not only in terms of delaying the contribution that we can make to improving the world's environment but also in terms of how much it will cost additionally to take on the task of reducing Australia's emissions. Federal Treasury have consistently stated that delaying this crucial reform will only increase the costs of decoupling carbon pollution from economic growth. These amendments are an attempt to sacrifice the national interest by delaying this crucial economic reform for purely partisan political motives.

              </small>
              <p>
               This debate was summed up in a simple sentence given to me by a senior within my own electorate of Flinders. That senior, a pensioner, said to me, 'If the people have to pay, surely, the people should have a say,' and right now we are debating the Leader of the Opposition's attempt to give the people who will pay in higher electricity prices, higher gas prices, higher grocery prices and higher prices across all goods made or manufactured in this country, a say. That is what is on the table at this moment in this place. Whether you support a carbon tax or oppose a carbon tax, you should support giving the people a say at the next election as to whether or not they face that carbon tax. It is a simple proposition. In a democratic society a government has a duty to take a fundamental policy to the people to win that mandate and then to implement it.
              </p>
              <p>
               This government unfortunately pledged that there would be no carbon tax. The Prime Minister in particular said on the day before the election, 'I rule out a carbon tax.' It was so fundamental to her pitch to the Australian people that it was her closing pledge and, on the Monday leading up to that election, she ruled out a carbon tax with the very famous words: 'There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.' In that context, these amendments are about giving the people a say. It is about giving the people the right at the next election to determine whether or not they face a carbon tax. There is no barrier to anyone in this House supporting the right of the people having a say and, if the Prime Minister believes all that she says, then take it to an election. Bring forward the election. Let the people vote and let them vote soon, and in that way they can determine whether or not Australia faces this tax. That is our goal, our objective: to give the people a say and let them determine their future and to do so because of the profound consequences of a system which is ineffective, sends an extraordinary amount of money overseas, and will not solve the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
               This does not solve the problem. Let me give you three simple examples. Does it decrease demand for electricity, as the Prime Minister has discussed on many occasions? The parliamentary secretary in a debate last week conceded that this bill is not designed to decrease demand for electricity. That is a profound and extraordinary concession. Demand will not be decreased.
              </p>
              <p>
               What about supply? Will it change supply? Will this bill cause any coal fired power stations to shut within the next decade? The answer is that the carbon tax side of it will not. What have the government had to do? They have had to go straight to the coalition's direct action plan to create an Emissions Reduction Fund to buy out coal fired power stations. We would clean them up; they want to close them down. But they have conceded that their bill will not cause one single coal fired power station to close. But, according to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Generators_Forum" rel="nofollow">
                National Generators Forum
               </a>
               today, it will lead to the best part of $40 billion in additional electricity costs between now and 2020 being passed on to consumers.
              </p>
              <p>
               The third thing it was meant to do was to bring on board new renewable energy. But the tax itself will not do that. We have a 20 per cent renewable energy target and that will not be increased by one watt—not a megawatt, not even a watt. This legislation will not decrease demand for electricity, as claimed by the parliamentary secretary. It will not close down any coal fired power stations, as claimed by the government, who have had to rely on the coalition's own mechanism to try to clean up the coal fired power sector. It is interesting: having conceded that their method will not deal with cleaning up coal fired power stations, out of all of the possible systems in the world they could use, they chose the coalition's. Great work, guys! Your system will not work and you have had to turn to ours. The difference is that we will not close down power stations. We will clean them up and you will close them down—and to no effect. Above all else, it will send $3.5 billion every year, going north from 2020, straight to foreign carbon traders. That is why we do not support this legislation.

               <p>
                I rise to oppose the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I find the hypocrisy of his argument absolutely outstanding. This is a man who stood there today and said, 'The Prime Minister was untruthful before the election.' This is a man who said that you cannot believe anything he says unless he writes it down. Then, when he does write it down, he still goes against it. It is absolute hypocrisy. The member for Flinders quoted the
                <i>
                 Australian
                </i>
                article—but of course, in typical fashion for the opposition, they do not let the truth get in the way of a good story: 'Let's give only half a quote.' The Prime Minister was very clear and concise in saying that she would not rule out a carbon pollution reduction scheme—a market mechanism. That is what we went to the election with. We said that before the election. I attended a forum before the election to which the Liberal Party—the shadow minister and the local candidate—were invited and never turned up. They would not even front up to it. I strongly support taking action against pollution, and I do that because I want to do the right thing by our kids.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is not about today, tomorrow or some rubbishy amendment that says, 'Call an election on everything.' You would have to ask: what is it about? It is about our future. It is about making sure that our kids and our grandkids have a clean future. It is about making sure they have an opportunity to continue farming, to continue manufacturing and to continue to have the life that we enjoy here in Australia—and to do it in a cleaner, greener future. These are the things that those opposite fail to understand.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you listen to the arguments that the opposition put forward, the only thing they are saying is, 'If we make a big policy we should go to an election.' Under that theory you would expect that an Abbott government would have an election every single week. Every time they made a decision they would have to go to an election. It is absolutely silly to say that this amendment is genuinely about doing the right thing for this nation and the right thing for the people in this country. We, on the other hand, have been very clear. We have supported putting a price on pollution. We have done that from day one and we continue to do it. And we do it knowing that it is about delivering a better future for this country. We do it by supporting households. We are supporting households by making sure that nine out of 10 households will receive assistance for any price adjustments. We know that some things will go up and some things will go down. We know that the cost of electricity over the last decade, particularly in Victoria, has gone up dramatically. Why has it gone up dramatically? Because those opposite sold off the

                 SEC

                , they took away all the investment that was coming from there—the jobs—and they left the

                an absolute wreck. They took the money and ran and left no investment in electricity infrastructure. That infrastructure is failing, it is breaking down, and that is what is causing the rise in the price of electricity. It has continued to rise every year and it will continue to do so, because of the failures of those opposite, because of their selling everything off—selling off the farm—

                I support what the government have done and I am very proud to see that the vote went through today. I actually support jobs and I support industry. You might scoff over there, but I notice that you backed away very quickly and you would not support the steel industry. You do not support keeping jobs in this country. You actually go out there every day, put your hard hat on, get your silly little photo taken and say, 'Look at me: I'm backing the workers.' There is not a worker in this country that believes for one minute that

                cares a damn about them. They know that as soon as he gets back in power, the first thing he will do—along with his National Party mates—is to rip the guts out of workers' wages and conditions. You know it is true, because your own backbenchers are saying it—the same backbenchers who are saying, 'Let's put

                on food.' That is exactly what will happen. You will go out of your way to rip workers' rights and conditions away. Everyone knows that you do not give a damn about them, and that is why these amendments should not be supported.

                 The confidence in our democracy has been seriously damaged by the way in which this government has introduced its carbon tax legislation. The government promised faithfully, before the last election, that there would be no carbon tax. The Prime Minister said it quite clearly. She could have withdrawn the statement; she could have corrected it if she had been misunderstood.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy" rel="nofollow">
                  Deputy
                 </a>
                 Prime Minister was even more vehement and ridiculed anybody who suggested that Labor might, at some stage during this next term of government, implement a carbon tax. Every Labor member sitting opposite today was elected on a promise that there would be no carbon tax. Today they are giving the lie to that promise. They are not honouring the word they gave to the Australian people before the election. All Labor candidates said there would be no carbon tax. All Liberal candidates said there would be no carbon tax. All National candidates said there would be no carbon tax. The only member of this House who supported a carbon tax and who is therefore being honest to his word in supporting this legislation today is the Greens member. This, therefore, is a crisis in confidence because the government failed to honour its promises. This is a major change. It is way ahead of anything anybody else in the world is doing. In fact, most of the rest of the world is moving in different directions. There are no models to follow. There are no international agreements to implement this kind of arrangement. So it is appropriate that the people have a say. We suggested there be a plebiscite; Labor rejected that. The Howard government gave an example by going to the Australian people and seeking a mandate before introducing the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
                  GST
                 </a>
                 reform. That was the model that this government should follow. People have a right to a say. That is a fundamental part of our democracy and, therefore, the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition that this bill should be tested by the Australian people at an election is an appropriate way for a democracy to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I refer briefly to some of the other amendments before the parliament. The amendment of the member for
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
                  O'Connor
                 </a>
                 has considerable merit. It proposes to exempt the relatively small emitters from having to pay for the effects of the carbon tax. It also has significant benefits for regional areas. It reduces some of the massive disadvantage that is built into this carbon tax through the way the government has proposed it. People in country areas will pay more carbon tax than those who live in the cities. Most of the jobs lost will be in regional areas. This tax is a particular burden on people who live outside the capital cities. So I welcome his proposal to look at ways to reduce that disadvantage. I think we need to look at the amendment in the context of the legislation as a whole. Taking some of the tax away from the small users would undoubtedly result in a fairer system.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This legislation is full of anomalies. The government has never been prepared to address those in the debate. Whenever anybody has raised questions to the Prime Minister and others about various issues, she has simply dismissed them and said, 'You are a climate change denier.' If you raised any areas of detail you were immediately accused of being opposed to taking any kind of action to protect our climate or she said, 'It is the right thing to do,' never justifying that. It is just some right thing to do. It was never a right thing to include many of the anomalies in the legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The government have admitted today that the legislation has significant anomalies and they have come into the House with amendments. They gave these amendments to the opposition only as the Minister for
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                  Climate Change
                 </a>
                 and

                  Energy Efficiency
                 </a>
                 spoke. There was no real chance for us to consider them in detail. I note the comments on the changes to landfill, an issue I have raised in this parliament on a number of occasions and have been ridiculed by the minister opposite for daring to so do. This proposal seems to address the issue for only three years, so local government would also be concerned. I have also raised the changes to aviation on a number of occasions. But does this amendment also deal with the smaller airlines like Rex or is it something for only the larger airlines? The government always refuse to deal with the detail, even if the detail can be corrected. There are lots more anomalies that the government have not sought to address which I do not have time to raise now but which I may raise later in the debate. But, even if the anomalies are corrected, this is still an evil tax. This is still a tax that costs Australian jobs and the only practical thing to do is to vote the bill down.

                   Wide Bay

                  . I indicated in question time today that the government was giving some consideration to this proposal moved by the member for O'Connor. The government is in fact not inclined to agree to that amendment.

                 <p>
                  It is very important to go back to some of the basics of the policy in considering this issue: a broad based carbon price will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest overall cost to the economy. The bills overall seek to apply an effective carbon price to off-road energy use outside of agriculture, fisheries and forestry to provide an effective price signal relative to the carbon content of the fuel used. Off-road fuel usage is a separate matter from the carbon-pricing mechanism. The way the off-road fuel use is dealt with—whether it is an off-road energy need that is met by electricity from the grid, from diesel, from onsite generation, from biofuels, from renewable energy generation, from
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
                   LPG
                  </a>
                  or from natural gas—means the relative carbon intensity of fuels is taken into account in the formulation of the bills.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The different arrangements for natural gas, LPG and liquid fuels combine to ensure that the impact of carbon pricing—or an effective carbon price—flows through to end users in a manner that is competitively neutral for both energy suppliers and the industries which use that fuel. Of course, the flowthrough of that has been an important factor in modelling household assistance, for example. Obviously, the effective price is not retained by all businesses. It is passed through and, ultimately, that leads to the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                   CPI
                  </a>
                  effect that has been modelled and the way in which the household assistance has been designed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  All of these arrangements have been fully taken into account in the design of the household assistance package. They are a key part of establishing a carbon price in the Australian economy and rewarding low-pollution choices of large and small businesses. The point at which the carbon price applies has been designed to achieve broad coverage while minimising administrative costs. The use of the fuel taxation system to apply an effective carbon price to fuels will achieve broad coverage of fuel emissions while minimising compliance costs to business because it uses the existing fuel taxation arrangements. Fuel-using businesses will still claim fuel tax credits using existing administrative systems and will not be subject to additional regulation, compliance burdens under the carbon-pricing mechanism or the need to engage in carbon markets. So businesses in those circumstances will not have to be concerned with any of those matters. The government also recognises the issues for small, off-grid electricity generation—and this is one of the matters that I think the member for O'Connor has expressed concern about—so support is provided for off-grid generation through multiplier arrangements under the renewable energy target, in particular, and the $40 million investment in the Remote Indigenous Energy Program, which I know is also a matter of interest and concern to the member for O'Connor. If that amendment were to be passed, there would not be competitive neutrality between different fuel users, and more-emissions-intensive liquid fuels would be advantaged relative to grid electricity, renewables, natural gas and LPG. In addition, up to 200 liable entities under the carbon price mechanism whose emissions mainly relate to non-liquid fuels or other sources of emissions may also have no effective carbon price for their liquid fuel emissions, should the amendment be passed. Clearly, that would not be consistent with the intent of the legislation. It could also result in assistance being provided to industry or households for costs which they did not face.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can develop some of these arguments a bit further in the course of the evening's debate, but those are the broad reasons why the government does not support the amendments moved by the member for O'Connor.

                   Members of parliament are often accused of not keeping their promises, they are often accused of breaching faith with the public, and as a result there is a level of cynicism within the Australian public about some parliamentarians. In fact, there was a whole political movement that was based on holding politicians to their promises: the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
                    Australian Democrats
                   </a>
                   . As you might recall, they had a famous pledge to 'keep the bastards honest'. Now we have a complete reversal of Don Chipp's famous pledge. The government, the Greens and some of the Independents have decided to keep the government dishonest, complicit as they are in ensuring that the Prime Minister's clear breach of her commitment before the last election now becomes law. Instead of holding the Prime Minister to her promise, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' the Labor Party, the Greens and some of the Independents are holding the Prime Minister to a broken promise, to a breach of faith with the Australian people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That promise was not some aside or some afterthought on the part of the Prime Minister. It was not just a throwaway line or an unscripted, unguarded moment. No, this was a carefully considered, deliberate statement made to mislead the Australian people into voting Labor. That is why the Prime Minister said, in response to the Leader of the Opposition's constant refrain throughout the election campaign that, 'As sure as night follows day, if this government is re-elected there will be a carbon tax,' the Prime Minister deliberately set about trying to convince the Australian people that she would not introduce a carbon tax. Now, rather than hold the Prime Minister to that promise, we have members who are trying to force through the parliament a policy unsupported by any electoral mandate at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Major reforms are challenging and they are difficult to implement, so it is vital to bring the Australian people into your confidence and bring them with you as you seek to implement reforms that will transform the economy, for good or for bad. The Prime Minister did recognise this during the election campaign, when she was talking about a price on carbon but promised it would not be introduced until there had been consultation for a couple of years in order to build a lasting consensus. Yet, when the Prime Minister realised that the government might well lose the election because of the threat of a carbon tax, she set about deliberately misleading the Australian public into voting Labor on the basis that Labor would not introduce a carbon tax.

                   Compare that to the history surrounding the introduction of the goods and service tax. During his first term as Prime Minister,

                    John Howard
                   </a>
                   became convinced of the need to replace the complex layers of wholesale sales tax with a flat-rate
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
                    GST
                   </a>
                   . Labor vowed to campaign against the GST, but their attack was blunted because Prime Minister Howard decided to take the proposed GST to an election, to campaign on it and seek a mandate from the Australian people, to ask the Australia people whether they supported the introduction of this tax. He took a risk, but he had courage and he had the respect of the Australian people, and he showed them respect in return: he put that tax to the Australian electorate. I remember that 1998 election. It was my first election. It was very hard fought. But we had the courage to take the Australian people into our confidence, tell them what we were proposing to do and seek their support—and we got it. Through this parliament, this legislation is being foisted on the Australian people, without their having a say on this most fundamental transformation of our economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I urge the members of the Labor Party to support these amendments. Show the Australian people some respect. Show them that you care about the promises you make at an election and that you are prepared to stick to your promises—and, if you change your mind, then take it to an election.

                    It is disappointing that what we all know to be such a serious issue, not just for Australia but for the globe, is being used for political purposes by the members opposite in the way it has been for not weeks but months now. Rather than come in here and debate the merits of the clean energy bills before parliament, they continuously choose to play politics. In response to the member for Curtin's contribution, I say this: I too recall the 1998 election, and the outcome of that election, as I recall, was that the two-party preferred vote—that is, the majority of Australian people who voted—was against the Howard government. Yet the Howard government, knowing that a majority of Australians had voted against that proposition, still came into this chamber and turned that proposition into law. The Howard government did that because, at the time, it believed it was doing the right thing. In the same way, this government believes it is doing the right thing with these bills. This was said on 6 November 1990:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    … the threat to our world comes not only from tyrants and their tanks. It can be more insidious though less visible. The danger of global warming is as yet unseen, but real enough for us to make changes and sacrifices, so that we do not live at the expense of future generations.
                   </p>

                    's speeches. She made a number of speeches in respect to this very issue, 21 or 22 years ago—and 22 years later we are still debating the merits of whether we should do anything or not.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is interesting that 21 years ago Margaret Thatcher touched on two critical issues. Firstly, global warming is hard to accept because you cannot see many of the changes that are taking place. They occur relatively slowly, although quickly in terms of the time that man has been on this planet. Secondly, she talked about making changes that cause sacrifices. All people, if asked, would rather not have to make sacrifices. It is clear that this is exactly what the opposition are playing with the Australian people. They are pretending to the people that you do not have to make a sacrifice, that you do not have to do anything, because the issue will go away—it is not really there because you cannot really see it. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is why this debate is so disappointing. Members opposite know that this is being dishonest with the Australian public.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I suspect there are many members opposite who know that this situation, global warming, is real and that we as a nation have a responsibility—not only to ourselves and to the globe but also to future generations—to act and to do so now. They also know that each year we delay action on this issue it becomes much more difficult and much more costly for future generations, if and when a decision is finally made.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Members opposite constantly say that this is not a good time for Australia to act. Please tell us when you think it will be a good time. It would be fair to say that there will never be a good time to make tough decisions which impact on the Australian people but they are decisions that have to be made. If we do not make them, the costs to Australians will continue to rise. Because we failed to act 20 years ago and because we failed to act three or four years ago, we are already paying dearly.

                    has supported a price on carbon for the last decade or so. I recall that this was an issue in 2004, an issue in 2007 and an issue in 2010. It has been debated, and the Australian people supported a price on carbon in those elections.

                    <p>
                     I am certainly pleased to rise and put on the record my opposition to the carbon tax that Labor has proposed in this House. There can be no doubt, in considering my remarks ahead of this evening's debate, that the world does need to address the issue of climate change. There can be no doubt that, globally, mankind is having an impact. As the father of a three-year-old son, as someone who looks at what is happening around the world, I cannot help but think to myself that not only is there a certain—and I do not want to overstate it in any way, shape or form—element of morality to this from one generation to the next but also there is something more fundamentally and economically rational about tackling climate change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     For the last five, six or even 10 decades the world predominantly has relied on one source of fuel to drive electricity and generate power for industry. This at its core has been crucial to the way in which, globally, we have helped to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and into a better state of living. It has been at the core of the way in which societies have helped to raise standards of living, lower infant mortality, increase life spans and make a material difference to humanity's survival on this planet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We have reached a point where, if we apply adequate resources and ingenuity, we are able to develop, commercialise and harness other renewable forms of electricity in a way that will make a difference to our world, to our environment and to mankind going forward. Ultimately, it is in all of our collective interests to develop a form of renewable energy that does not have a significant detrimental environmental impact. That is just plain good economics, that is just plain good common sense and that is an approach to this issue that resonates with the moral obligation we have from one generation to the next.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Unfortunately, I seek to make the bulk of my contribution to consideration in detail on the amendments, because I was gagged by the government from speaking in the main debate that took place earlier today. That notwithstanding, I feel very strongly about this issue. That is part of the reason I said to the Leader of the Opposition I was prepared to fly back from
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
                      New York
                     </a>
                     , from my secondment to the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                      United Nations
                     </a>
                     . I wanted to put on the record my opposition to Labor's approach. There can be no doubt, as I said, that we as a nation do have an obligation to act on climate change, but this is not the correct approach. Labor's approach to tackling climate change—through the introduction of a carbon tax and, in a more deceitful way, through the introduction of a carbon tax without a mandate; in fact, quite the opposite, since the Prime Minister vowed, only days out from the last election, that if elected they would not introduce a carbon tax—is not the approach. The key to ensuring the success of a reform like this is to ensure that the community has ownership of the reform. And Labor's approach provides no community ownership whatsoever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This is a significant reform that absolutely must be done in lock step with global action. Despite the pressing need for there to be action on climate change, despite the issues that I have raised about economic consequences and despite the fact that I believe there is a moral obligation to deal with climate change, to do so effectively unilaterally, thus imposing a significant impost on the Australian economy when the rest of the world is not at that point, is economic recklessness. It is blind ideology that drives an agenda that does not look to the stark reality that, in order to perform meaningful change, in order to foster and grow meaningful ownership of a reform throughout a community, you must ensure that the community is going to be better off for that reform.

                      <p>
                       I am very pleased to participate again in this debate, particularly following the member for Moncrieff, who has so significantly acknowledged that action on climate change is such a moral imperative and there is a need to take urgent action on climate change, because it is not often that you get those concessions consistently from members of the opposition. Certainly it is very unlikely that we would get, on any given day, and indeed on consecutive days, those sorts of concessions from a leader of the opposition.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This is certainly a historic occasion for those of us on this side of the House who have assiduously committed ourselves to moving along a policy initiative that is very significant for our environment and for business certainty to create the kind of long-term opportunity and prosperity that we know is necessary and required for the development of clean energy industries in order to give Australians jobs into the future and in order to sustain the kind of economic circumstances that we find ourselves in presently.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       By contrast, in those opposite, and certainly in the most recent statements of the Leader of the Opposition in moving his amendment, we see hysteria; we see continuing hysteria. We see a bid to delay significant action on climate change. We see a policy vacuum. We see a leadership vacuum. The Leader of the Opposition's amendments today seem to me to be more about distraction. You might ask, 'Distraction from what?' I think the most significant thing that the Leader of the Opposition wants to distract all of us from with his amendment is his failure to support the steel industry in this country through the steel transformation plan.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       That is curious because not long ago the Leader of the Opposition visited and spoke at the Australian Steel Convention and said:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       The steel industry is very important to Australia’s economy. From smelting to fabricating, steel employs about 90,000 people—critical to so many other sectors of our economy as well … So, steel is critical to our way of life, steel is important in our economy and I’ve been making the point up hill and down dale since the carbon tax was first announced …
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Well, he has been up hill, he has been down dale, and occasionally he has snuck off the edge of the dale and into the gutter—in fact, more often than not he has found himself there. But unfortunately today, despite his several pages of oration to the Australian Steel Convention, he seems incapable of coming into this place and supporting and encouraging those who sit alongside him to practically give support to the steel industry. Instead he comes up with another fig leaf—this sad little amendment, which is a bid to delay one of the most significant reforms being made to our economy and in our country's history. He inevitably will and his colleagues in the Senate most likely will try to oppose significant endeavours to continue to support the steel industry. So, despite all the rhetoric and visits to steel mills, the wearing of hard hats and pretending to be out doing hard graft alongside Australian workers, once again, when it comes to actually making a decision and taking a vote, Mr Abbott is off having another siesta.

                       This reform that we are pursuing today we have pursued long and hard for many months now. Indeed, as one of the previous speakers mentioned, our action on initiatives such as this and action on climate change has been many years in the making. Our efforts are about ensuring that electorates such as mine benefit from the development of clean energy industries, clean energy technologies. They are about ensuring that electorates such as mine which have significant areas of environmental heritage are duly protected and are not exposed to extreme weather events such as bushfires.

                       So, contrary to the reformist, forward-thinking initiatives of this government, all that those opposite and the Leader of the Opposition can offer to the Australian people is delay and a policy and leadership vacuum. That is simply not good enough.

                       <p>
                        As I was saying earlier, there are some facts about this debate that simply cannot be ignored. First among them is the fact that, at its core, Labor's policy, which would effectively penalise the Australian economy vis-a-vis other industrialised economies, will see a five per cent reduction in emission levels when Australia currently contributes around 1½ per cent of global emissions. So we are talking about imposing a multibillion-dollar tax on the Australian economy. We are talking about imposing a significant burden, which must be shared by households and by small and large businesses across the Australian economy, to make a five per cent reduction to global emissions of 1.5 per cent. The lunacy of Labor's approach on this—I heard it from the speaker immediately prior to me, and this is the great con job that lies at the core of this debate—is that it is a choice between positives and nothing. This is an approach that forces Australians to choose between the economic benefits that might flow from this policy and nothing.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
                         Can I
                        </a>
                        put it unequivocally on the record that I believe there are benefits flowing from a shift to renewables—and I have already indicated that. But the key difference between my perspective and Labor's approach is that I say it must be done in lock step with other developed economies because there are costs associated with this reform that cannot be ignored. While it might suit the arguments of Labor members to claim that it is only ever filled with positives, there are significant and real economic disadvantages that will directly flow from Labor's imposition of this tax.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I am very willing to concede that there are benefits that will flow in time as well, and I say let us embrace these benefits. But we should embrace these benefits in lock step with other developed economies because, by doing that, we will ensure that the disadvantages that are felt immediately, as opposed to the longer term benefits that will flow in due course, are not done in a unilateral way.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I will speak about my own electorate of Moncrieff on the

                         Gold Coast
                        </a>
                        . There can be no clearer example of the difference between long-term benefits and short-term costs than the tourism industry. Under Labor's proposal before the House, which has now been passed in terms of the second reading speech, we have a situation where international tourists coming to Australia will pay more as a result of Labor's carbon tax with no compensation. There is no international compensation for tourists travelling to Australia. So, for the 70 or 80 per cent of the Australian economy who will be facing increased costs—the service side of the economy—there will be no global compensation. They will pay more to visit Australia than other countries that are not doing this. What will their choice be? If you believe in the basic laws of supply and demand, when the price goes up, fewer people will demand the product. That is point No. 1.

                          he minister at the table interjects. He concedes that the tourism industry is already being battered by a sky-high Australian dollar. He says, 'Oh well, they've already got that problem, so why would we worry about this other problem?' This is the lunacy of this government. This is the lunacy of an approach that says, 'We're already doing it tough because of this factor, so what's one more nail in the coffin?' So there is no compensation for international tourists.

                          In addition to that, under Labor's policy there will be no carbon tax payable on a flight overseas for an Australian but there will be a price payable to holiday domestically. So, in addition to there being a disadvantage for Australia vis-a-vis other countries around the world, under Labor's policy it will cost you more to holiday domestically but it will not cost you more to holiday internationally—and that in some way makes sense to the Labor Party as well! So, using that one industry as an example, we can already see the immediate upfront economic disadvantages that will flow to the Australian economy versus the long-term benefits that will flow to the Australian economy—which are largely qualitative and perhaps even unquantifiable—as a result of Labor's changes. The simple issue is that these reforms must be done in lock step with the rest of the world.

                           In this chamber today we saw, from those opposite, one of the greatest acts of political hypocrisy and political doublespeak that we have witnessed in this country for a very long time. It came in particular from the member for Indi and the Leader of the Opposition, who have spent the last nine months travelling the length and breadth of this country knocking people out of the way to get into workshops and don silly hard hats and fluoro vests so that they could pose for cameras in front of real workers and try and send a message around the country that they care for workers. They had an opportunity in this place today to put those slogans, that cheap rhetoric, into action and put their votes where their mouths are, but they squibbed it. They had an opportunity to stand up for Australian workers. They had an opportunity to stand up for people like those in my electorate of Throsby and do something valuable for them, but they went missing. They had the opportunity to vote for the steel industry transformation plan. This is a plan that is providing $300 million worth of much-needed assistance to the steel industry, which is vital to my region and the national economy. As the member for
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
                            La Trobe
                           </a>
                           has previously identified, the steel industry provides jobs to thousands of Australians and provides an incredibly important product to Australian and international markets, and it is finding it very difficult to trade in an international environment with very high input costs—the flipside of the high value that we are getting for our commodities like iron and coal—and the very high Australian dollar.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           So the opposition had the opportunity today to say they were going to do something to assist the workers and companies in the steel industry and they went missing. I know that many of those opposite might say that the reason they voted against this was because they are opposed to what the government is doing to put a price on carbon and put in place real action to deal with climate change. The simple fact of the matter is that they could have maintained that objection and still voted in favour of the steel industry and manufacturing workers because not one cent of the revenue that is raised from the carbon price is going into the steel industry transformation plan; they are completely separate revenue streams. It would have been possible for the member for Indi to try and convince all of those economic rationalists on her front bench and those on her back bench to do something in support of manufacturing workers, but they went missing. They went missing because what they have been engaging in over the last nine months is nothing more than a sideshow designed for the media crew and it has absolutely no substance. We have a plan. We have a bundle of legislation which will enable us to deal with the generational challenge of climate change, and deal with it in the cheapest, most efficient and most effective way possible. It is a way, by putting a price on carbon and providing incentives to invest in energy efficiency, that will enable business to transform at the lowest cost. It acknowledges that there are some industries which need additional assistance and need shielding from the carbon price because of the nature of their business—the nature of their manufacturing process or their production process. We have put in place a well calibrated package which deals with the economic circumstances of these businesses.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           We have been met today by a proposition that we should delay the introduction of this legislation and the carbon price. This comes after 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994. There have been about 250 questions asked in this place on carbon pricing and over 15 separate MPI debates. We have had around 33 hours of speaking on this legislation alone, featuring around, or in addition to, 120 speakers on this. I do not think anybody who has been witnessing this debate for over 10 years can say that we have not had a full and proper debate, that the science is not known and that everything is not clear.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           When you analyse the real reason behind this motion to delay the introduction of this legislation you find that there is one thing—and one thing alone. We know that delay will prevent the thing that those opposite fear the most. The thing that they fear the most is the lived experience of this legislation. They know that from 1 July next year the sky is not going to fall in, and all of those consumers around the country will be measuring in brown copper coins the increase to their costs, and not in the orange-and-yellow notes, as they have been led to believe, by those opposite. That is the real reason lying behind their motion to delay. We have had enough delay already.

                            The point I go on about with respect to Labor's approach in this particular debate, and the reason why this is not the correct approach, and why the coalition's way is a better way, is perhaps best summed up by some of the media commentary. Labor's approach to this has been not to tell the truth prior to the last federal election about their intentions and to introduce something that the Prime Minister said she would not introduce.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Labor's approach is also only to speak about the positives and completely ignore the negatives that flow from their policy. The old adage is, 'You can only fool some of the people some of the time, and you can't fool all of the people all of the time.'
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Labor's approach is perhaps best summed up by a variety of front pages from the

                            You could understand the logic if these negative consequences were occurring in our economy at the same time as they were occurring in other economies. But the Labor Party pretend that the negative consequences simply do not exist and I guess the next election will probably sort out what the Australian people think about that. The Australian people know that there are very real and significant negative consequences from Labor's carbon tax: job losses, increased rates, increased power bills, more expensive aircraft flights, more expensive fuel, household costs to go up. You name it there will be a massive price impact. But it will not be happening around the rest of the world; it will only be happening in this country.

                            This is not a choice between a carbon tax or nothing. The reality is that countries can still invest in renewables, countries can still commercialise new R&amp;D and countries can still explore new alternatives without the impost of a carbon tax.

                            The reality is that Labor's plan is not the correct approach. Most fundamentally it is not the correct approach because it is an approach that is based on deceit. It is an approach without a mandate. It is an approach without any bona fide support of the Australian people. Labor is simply burying its head in the sand and shrieking that there are only benefits and no negatives, when the evidence is crystal clear that the costs are significant. That only reinforces how out of touch this government has become.

                             It was good to hear the member for Moncrieff acknowledge in the first of his speeches that there are actually negative consequences for inaction. We have heard so much negative comment and fear mongering from this opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is effectively a walking stuntman going from town to town looking for workers to pose in front of, spreading fear about what will happen if we as a nation decide to act on climate change. Then we had the member for Moncrieff collecting the media articles that result from that and reading them into the House as if they were some sort of evidence. He may as well, in fact, be reading the Liberal Party press releases.
                            </p>

                             I want to go back to something he also said, where he referred to Australia's contribution to greenhouse gases in the world and used that as a reason to not act. It is something we hear from time to time. We hear people say that Australia's contribution is less than two per cent and therefore we should not act. I want to address that. Australia per head of population is the highest emitter in the world by quite a significant margin. When you look at it by volume we are No. 15 in the world. There are only 14 countries that emit more greenhouse gases by volume than we do. So we are well and truly a very large contributor. But more than that, when you look at the other countries that emit around the same level of greenhouse emissions as us—less than two per cent—such countries represent over 50 per cent of world emissions. If every country that emitted two per cent or less took the attitude the member for Moncrieff and so many on the opposition want us to take then action would be left to the remaining 50 per cent. That is clearly not a path the world can take. Countries have to act, including us.

                             There were also statements made about Australia's prosperity and our reliance for that prosperity over many decades—in fact, centuries—on fossil fuel. That is absolutely true: our prosperity is well and truly coupled to fossil fuel. But for me that is the very reason why we should act. A good friend of mine,

We had the right stuff in the ground when that was the source of prosperity, and we still have that stuff in the ground and we continue to prosper through it. But the rest of the world over the last decade has been moving slowly away from that. Investment in clean energy last year exceeded investment in fossil fuel. That means the rest of the world is seeking their prosperity from a technology that we are not in.

                             for our renewables. As a nation that is where our renewables still come from. About eight per cent of our power comes from renewables and it is still from the Tasmanian and Snowy hydro schemes, which were built many, many decades ago. So while the rest of the world is moving into new technologies, developing skills, developing infrastructure, educating their young and skilling-up their workforce in new sources of prosperity, we as a nation have been hanging around assuming we can continue to benefit from the old way of the world, which is fossil fuels.

                             It is important as a nation, of course, that we acknowledge that we do prosper from that and we use the revenue raised from the sale of permits to assist the transition of our industry from the old fossil fuel economy to the new clean energy future. We are doing that. We are putting more than half the revenue raised from putting a price on carbon pollution towards households to meet the price impact, but the rest of it goes on supporting jobs and the transition to a clean energy future. There is a $9.2 billion Jobs and Competitiveness Program to support jobs and encourage investment in clean technology. There is a $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program to help improve energy efficiency in manufacturing and support research. There is a $1.3 billion Coal Sector Jobs Package, a $70 million Coal Mining Abatement Technology Support Package, and a $300 million Steel Transformation Plan—that is on top of the $9.2 billion Jobs and Competitiveness Program. Of course we have seen the opposition vote against that today. We have to transition as a nation from the old fossil fuel economy to a new clean energy economy and I am incredibly pleased to speak in support of this today.

                              I rise to use this forum to speak on this carbon tax legislation after having been gagged speaking on the main debate—being allocated only five minutes to talk on it, which was absolutely shameful and in particular shameful for my electorate of Wannon. The constituents of my electorate deserve better treatment than that.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I rise tonight to talk on some particular aspects of this bill. I am glad that the minister is here tonight and I hope he is listening to what I have to say. It goes back to a question I asked the Prime Minister about the impact that this carbon tax will have on the dairy industry. In that question I outlined that if Murray-Goulburn or Bega or Warrnambool Cheese and Butter were operating in the European Union they would basically be exempt from paying the European Union carbon tax—the tax they pay under their emissions trading scheme.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              The dairy industry in Australia employs over 40,000 people and indirectly provides jobs for over 60,000 people. By not protecting our own local dairy industry the government is putting at risk local jobs within the dairy industry, because the dairy industry is an emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry. It has nowhere to go to pass the costs on. They have to be passed back to the dairy farmer. We have very good research which shows that an average dairy farmer will be hit with costs between $5,000 and $7,000 per dairy farm. For some of the bigger dairy farms in my electorate we are looking at costs of $10,000 to $15,000 to $20,000. I ask the minister in the chamber tonight: if he was putting an impact on his own constituents of $15,000 to $20,000 per farm, would he stand there and let this legislation go through? These are working dairy-farming families that he is hitting with these extra costs and taxes.

                              Following my question to the Prime Minister, the Australian Dairy Industry Council wrote to the Prime Minister, and copied it to the minister. It stated:

                              I write regarding your response to the member for Wannon in question time last Thursday regarding the impacts from the proposed carbon tax on the Australian dairy industry. Your response to the question infers that the likely cost impacts on dairy farming families and dairy companies are being misrepresented in the current debate. The Australian Dairy Industry Council strongly rejects any inference that we have or are engaging in misrepresentation on this issue. From the very start of public discussions on climate policy the

                              has observed that the impacts of carbon pricing on Australian dairy farmers were likely to be significant, unless appropriately structured. Carbon pricing would lead to a sharp increase in dairy's key on-farm energy import, electricity, and the inevitable pass-back of higher energy and import costs for diary manufacturers to farm suppliers in the form of lower milk prices.

You are directly whacking, directly impacting on, the dairy farmers in my electorate. It is time that the minister got his head out of the sand and had a look at the detrimental impact this carbon tax is going to have on the dairy industry, and especially on dairy farmers in my electorate.

                               I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the clean energy bills. The Gillard government has developed a comprehensive plan to move to a clean energy future. We, unlike those on the other side of the chamber, accept the science on climate change.

                               have been scaremongering around the country. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, is a risk to jobs and the economy. We need stability and a plan for the future.

                               Our plan is to move to a market price, whilst the Liberals have the same target as us but prefer instead to tax working families and give to the polluters, including multinationals—that is, take from battlers and give to the rich. Job opportunities in science and engineering and in building trades will open up as existing businesses move to clean energy and invest in new technology to generate less pollution. This is a great opportunity for this country. In fact, the Climate Institute research paper found that about 31,000 jobs could be created in regional Australia by 2030 if a price is put on carbon and clean energy policies are put into place. Climate Institute Chief Executive John Connor said:
                              </p>

                               We don’t want to be lumbered with the energy sources and jobs of the 20th century, while the 21st century charges on without us.

                               Australia generates more carbon pollution per person than any developed country, including the United States. We produce significantly more pollution per person than India and China. This is a problem we can no longer ignore. The world is moving to a clean energy future and we will be at the forefront. Some constituents in my electorate have asked me why Australia has to be first, and I say, 'Well, we were up there with universal health care, super and opening up our economy, and we need to be first with carbon as well.' I explain that countries around the world are already taking action on climate change: 89 countries, representing 80 per cent of global emissions and 90 per cent of the world's economy, have already pledged to take action on climate change. This is a tremendous commitment.

                               The world is shifting and accepting the science. Yet those opposite continue with their criticisms and scaremongering. And, yes, we have all heard the member for Warringah say he will rescind the carbon price if elected. He will also reverse household assistance. He would prefer to tax Australian families and hand the money to big business. The

                               What I find very interesting is that the vast majority of Liberal coalition members have not mentioned their direct action policy in this important debate. Is this because they are embarrassed about their policy? Is it because they would rather play cheap politics and hoodwink the Australian public about the government's plan? Is it because they do not believe the science and know that the Liberal Party will never action the policy if they do win government?

                               's carbon plan would send ordinary taxpayers' money direct to the biggest polluters, costing every household an average of $1,300. Yet, as I mentioned before, those on the seats opposite have been deathly quiet. This is a real difference between the Labor Party and the Liberals. Labor look after the vulnerable and create jobs for the future, whilst the Liberals look after the rich. I ask those opposite to get on board, to think about Australia's future and to support these bills.

                                I rise again to speak because I was gagged in speaking in the substantive debate on this legislation. I am going to use this forum and I will advertise the fact, again, that I will use various forums to keep hammering the government on this toxic tax. I once again say how appalled I was on behalf of my constituents that, for a bill which was over 1,200 pages, the government saw fit to give the electorate of Wannon and its representative only five minutes to speak on that over 1,200-page bill.
                               </p>

                                I will now turn to the impact that the toxic carbon tax will have on manufacturing in my electorate. I have been pursuing the government in this place on the impact that it will have on manufacturing in my electorate. On 3 March I asked the Prime Minister:
                               </p>
                               <p class="italic">
                                Portland Aluminium, located in my electorate of Wannon, directly employs 600 people. Across the country there are 60,000 jobs dependent on the aluminium industry. Will the Prime Minister guarantee that there will be no job losses in the aluminium industry as a result of the carbon tax?

                                What was the answer that I got? Could I get a straight answer to that pretty straightforward question? No, I could not. I got: 'Let's have a go at this. Let's have a go at that. We'll do everything that we can bar answer that question.' So, I followed up that and I asked the Treasurer, because I thought the Treasurer might be able to shed some light. I asked the Treasurer:

                                Does the Treasurer agree that relocating Australia's aluminium industry, including Portland Aluminium in my electorate, to countries that do not impose a tax on carbon would help reduce global emissions?

                                The Treasurer did give me a direct answer on that but it was not a very expansive one. I now know why the Treasurer would not expand on that and why the Prime Minister was rather reluctant to go into too much detail about the impact of the carbon tax on the aluminium sector. When Alcoa presented to the Senate select committee inquiry into carbon tax pricing, it came out that the carbon tax will cost the company around $40 million a year. This is a trade-exposed emissions-intensive industry and competes internationally. Yet we are sitting here today and those opposite are quite happy that Alcoa takes a $40 million hit to their bottom line. Aluminium is Victoria's biggest export and we are putting an additional cost of $40 million per annum on these exports. It beggars belief that we would be doing that to Victoria's largest manufacturer.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                There are other manufacturers in my electorate who are also going to be hit. I refer in particular to two in Ararat—
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AME" rel="nofollow">

                                Systems and Gason Industries. Both these small manufacturers actually produce equipment which reduces emissions. What is the government doing to assist and help these manufacturing businesses who are making goods here in Australia which help reduce emissions? They are adding to their costs. Go figure! We have leading technology being produced by these two businesses to help reduce emissions, and what is their reward? They are going to get hit with extra costs and in particular extra electricity costs. This carbon tax will be bad for manufacturing in my electorate; it will be bad for manufacturing in Australia.

                                <p>
                                 I may just respond to a couple of the things that the member for Wannon has raised. Firstly, shortly after the government announced the clean energy future package on 10 July I was at
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Henry" rel="nofollow">

                                 smelter in Victoria with representatives of Alcoa who, in fact, welcomed the government's policy announcement and the fact that the government had taken into account issues that they had raised. Specifically, of course, in the aluminium industry an average of 94.5 per cent of their carbon price liability will be offset in the first year of the scheme by the issuing of free carbon units, or free permits. Along with some other important changes that the government made to policy prior to it being announced on 10 July, Alcoa, certainly in their public commentary and in their observations to their own workforce—in fact, I spoke in the canteen with representatives of Alcoa and with a number of members of the workforce—indicated that their concerns have been met. That is an important thing to place on the record given the absurd hysteria that has just been recited by the member for Wannon.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Similarly in relation to the manufacturing sector—and the member for Wannon raised issues concerning the cost impost for small manufacturers—you have to bear in mind that the cost impact is, in fact, very modest in many businesses. The Treasury modelling, of course, indicates that the overall
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                                  CPI
                                 </a>
                                 impact is 0.7 per cent upon the introduction of the carbon price. Within that, electricity is modelled to rise around 10 per cent for households in particular. If we take that number and apply it to the current proportion of costs attributable to electricity for many businesses—and working with the Small Business Council and speaking to some other businesses, including an iron foundry—it is around two or three per cent of their total costs. Taking that figure and applying the Treasury modelling of a price increase for electricity, you are looking at a potential increase in the order of 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent in costs for many businesses. That is a manageable cost impost. Businesses which are not in the trade-exposed sector of the economy can pass through these costs, and it is the passing through of these modest cost increases that leads to the overall CPI increase. That is why the government has formulated a policy to deliver assistance to households. We are delivering assistance in the form of increases to benefits to meet those cost increases. For example, there will be a 1.7 per cent increase in the pension, with $250 to be paid in advance to single pensioners in May/June next year and, similarly, there will be a 1.7 per cent upfront payment to families in receipt of family tax benefits. These are the ways that the government is dealing with these cost increases and the overall CPI increase.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 In addition, for the manufacturing sector as described by the member for Wannon, there is an $800 million Clean Technology Program which is a co-contribution grants scheme to assist businesses to improve their energy efficiency. All these issues are pertinent too to the dairy industry, which has been raised by the member for Wannon. ABARES analysis indicates that electricity costs are about 2.3 per cent of total farm cash costs. With the increase in electricity prices, that will translate to an increase in costs of around 0.23 per cent in total farm cash costs. The government has been through these matters with dairy industry representatives a number of times. We do not agree with all of their calculations of the cost impost, and these are some data that are important to inject into the debate.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 We are very mindful that in dairy processing in particular there is a high level of electricity consumption. As a consequence of that, the government has formulated a $150 million program specifically for the food processing sector which will operate in the form of a co-contribution grant for dairy processors and others in the food industry to assist them to find efficient ways of reducing their electricity consumption—that is, to improve their energy efficiency. The government is committed to that program. It will help the industry. In discussions I have had with the industry, it has acknowledged that it will be an important contribution.

                                  I am glad that the minister is prepared to engage in the debate. I have a couple of things to say. Manufacturers cannot pass the costs through. These are businesses which compete globally, so they cannot pass the costs through; instead, they must suffer the consequences.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Let us listen to what three manufacturing businesses say. Alcoa has confirmed that the carbon tax along with the strong Australian dollar and high import costs is imposing 'a significant threat to the future viability of both the Victorian aluminium smelters'. Alcoa also confirms that the carbon tax will cost the company around $40 million a year. I will leave it there.

                                 <p>
                                  Let us look at the two small manufacturers in my electorate. Mr Peter Carthew, who is the Chairman and

                                  Mr Les Gason, Chairman of Gason Industries, says that they are expecting an increase of up to nine per cent in expenses. Forget about the Treasury modelling; that is what the business on the ground is saying—nine per cent in expenses. Mr Gason says:
                                 </p>

                                  This imposes a cost on us which I don’t believe is necessary or fair, because it is not imposed on the imports we compete against. These additional costs will make it a lot harder.

                                  I invite the minister to come down to Wannon, and together we could go and see these two small manufacturing businesses in Ararat. We could then go down to Warrnambool and meet with Murray-Goulburn and Warrnambool Cheese and Butter and have a discussion about the direct impact of the carbon tax on the dairy industry. We could then head to Portland and have a discussion there with the workers about the impact that the carbon tax will have on the aluminium sector. I extend an open invitation to the minister to come down.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  While we were there, we could also talk to local farmers. I have not started yet on the impact the carbon tax will have on other parts of the agricultural sector in my electorate. Agriculture has diversified in my electorate. We now do a lot of cropping. Modelling done on the impact of the carbon tax on a grain property in

                                  says that the tax will add an additional $36,000 a year in farm business costs. For meat processing, which is trade-exposed and emissions-intensive, the carbon tax will mean that at least another 24c to 30c per sheep is taken off the farmer's bottom line. We have just been through 10 years of drought, and now along comes the government to hit the competitiveness of our meat industry. For sheep meat we are looking at a 16 per cent loss under the carbon tax, and the list goes on.

                                  So I offer to the minister, the Prime Minister or any member of the government who would like to come down the chance to talk to the farmers, the manufacturers and, in particular, the dairy industry in the electorate of Wannon to see what impact this carbon tax is going to have. I reiterate once again to the minister that, if Murray-Goulburn, Warrnambool Cheese and Butter, Fonterra or Bega operated in Europe, they would be largely exempt under the

                                  scheme. The reason they would be exempt is the European Union does not want carbon leakage. It does not want jobs and industry going overseas. It is a shame that the government here will not stand up for our industries and for jobs in our country, and is going ahead with the standalone, do-it-yourself carbon tax, which is reckless.

                                   It is extremely important to know that this legislation also sustains existing industry. I have said before and I will keep saying that there is no minister who better understands how important it is to sustain employment by sustaining jobs in our traditional industries. In an electorate like mine, we value-add to steel from Whyalla. We make the steel products at

                                   using innovation to make innovative products that are used all over this nation. We make the aluminium and at Tomago Aluminium we are going to diversify and value-add to that product as well. We make cement. We also export the biggest volume of coal in the world. Under this government there is support for every one of those industries. I have been astounded by this government's willingness to listen and to respond to the needs of current industries and the jobs that they create.

                                   The other side have been really concerned because they have seen, not only in action but also at the tax forum and the jobs forum last week, a willingness from all stakeholders to step into the future and face with realism the challenges that confront our industries and our economy. A Prime Minister's task force has been set up to look at sustaining industry, just as a Prime Minister's task force was set up when BHP closed in Newcastle. I know that under the Gillard government this will be an extension of everything that is good in this legislation.

                                   It is always disappointing when the voices of those who should know a lot better spread fear and untruths, misrepresenting the realities of our economy. For example, the Premier of

                                   , repeated fallacious claims that up to 13,000 people in the Hunter would lose their jobs. That is not true. All the modelling says job growth in the Hunter is real. Mr Baldwin, the member for Paterson, said the coal industry in Newcastle is doomed. What rubbish—there is billions of dollars in forward investment and new terminals are being created by three different entities. Finally we have the legislation to boost our investment in clean energy and the future economy.

                                    That was very valiant attempt by the member for Newcastle to defend the indefensible, 19 carbon tax bills that will have a crushing impact on our economy and on our way of life. I rise to speak in this consideration in detail stage, in particular, to highlight the amendment brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition. I do so having been gagged in the second reading debate and prevented from delivering my speech in full on the government's 19 carbon tax bills because the debate in this chamber was guillotined by this government. I was not the only one who was gagged. Along with my friends and colleagues, the members for Riverina and for Wannon, I had just 20 seconds per bill to outline the concerns of my constituents in Higgins.

                                    Why is the gagging of debate so significant to the consideration in detail? It is significant because we learn tonight that the government is proposing to move 48 amendments. This means that 48 problems with these bills have already been identified. These bills consist of over 1,200 pages of legislation. The parliament had less than one minute per bill to consider one of the most complex changes to our economy. That is why the Leader of the Opposition has brought forward an amendment to defer the commencement of a carbon tax until after an election—until after the Australian people have had the opportunity to have their say and to restore their faith in government, a faith that has been so cruelly and wantonly broken by this Prime Minister. As we all know, there was no mandate from the Australian people for these bills for a carbon tax—in fact, from it, as the Prime Minister gave a categorical assurance only five days out from the election that there would be no carbon tax under the government that she led. The Treasurer also reinforced the government policy position by stating in his

                                    That is a direct quote. That is what the Treasurer of this country said. Again, I say there has been a cruel breach of faith with the Australian people.

                                    In my speech in the second reading debate I spoke about the fact that in bringing forward these bills we would be going it alone. We will be going it alone in a situation where we have a very parlous global economic condition.

                                    I want to now turn to why it is that we need to support the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition to defer commencement by first looking at the government figures, the government's modelling. We all know that the government have problems with their figures. We know that they are pretty good at turning a $20 billion surplus into an almost $50 billion deficit. They are good at changing no net debt to almost $107 billion of net debt. We know that they can increase the gross debt ceiling to $250 billion. This government are not great with their figures and that is why I want to talk about their modelling. Their modelling is very deficient when you consider the amendments that they had to bring forward. When they first announced their $9 billion a year tax they forgot to mention the fact that there was $4.3 billion over the forward estimates that the government had simply left off their model. Embarrassingly, the Treasurer tried to explain this away as a rounding error—some rounding error!

                                    on Economics, of which I am a member, were told by the government that due to the floods and Cyclone Yasi the devastation in Queensland and Victoria was such that the government needed a new tax to raise just $1.8 billion because the impact was going to be so significant on the budget bottom line. They said that the money could not come from appropriations like any other disaster because the impact was so great and yet in their own modelling they left off $4.3 billion. Question No. 1: if the government cannot get this simple fact right with their own modelling, what confidence can we possibly have that something as complex as a carbon tax can be got right? This is again another reason that we need to defer these carbon tax bills and the proclamation of these bills until after an election.

                                     It is interesting listening to members opposite. In particular I refer to those members who have spoken about the impact of this legislation on industry around Australia. I want to respond to a couple of comments made firstly by the member for Moncrieff, who earlier on was referring to the 1½ per cent that Australia contributes to total global emissions and the five per cent reduction target on the year 2000 levels by the year 2020. The member for Moncrieff criticised that target of a five per cent reduction on the year 2000 levels by 2020 saying that it was only five per cent. He conveniently neglected to say that it represents about 23 per cent on business as usual levels if we did nothing. It is in fact quite a significant decrease in emissions by the year 2020. Here is the irony of his comments: he also neglected to point out that his own party have set an equivalent target. If you are going to come in here and criticise the target of five per cent reduction by the year 2020 and your own party has adopted it, what does that say about your own credibility?

                                     Quite frankly, the member for Moncrieff also omitted to talk about the impact of the policies that his leader has put to this House as an alternative to achieving those targets. If you believe that we ought to achieve those targets then you must have a strategy to do so. We have heard about their strategy, and their strategy will cost households about $1,300 a year as opposed to $9.90, or around $500, which is the cost of this legislation—in other words, more than twice as much. What impact will that have on the industries and the businesses that he claims and purports to be concerned about?

If the member for Moncrieff is genuinely concerned about the impact of this legislation on those business operators in Queensland, where is his concern when the fact is that, if we do nothing, the impact on their businesses will be even greater and there will be 222,000 people whose jobs are at risk?

                                     have all had an indirect or direct tax system that impacts on industries in those countries, and you can break that down to a cost per tonne. So it is not as though we are acting in isolation and it is not as though we are not acting on a level playing field. It is a fact that, since 1990, we have been acting with an advantage because we have had no price per tonne on carbon in this country. Let us be honest when we start making comparisons with what is proposed in this legislation and what is occurring around the world. The reality is, as the

                                     <p>
                                      I rise again to speak on this issue in the consideration in detail. I return to the point that I was making earlier regarding the government's very rubbery figures: the fact that it forgot $4.3 billion and then said, 'Oops! Don't worry about it; it's simply a rounding error'. What that demonstrates to all of us in this chamber is that the government got it wrong again on its figures and then, of course, found an excuse to try to make it look as though it was all meant to be. But we know that it was not meant to be. The government's default position is to tax and spend, and the carbon tax that the government has brought forward is the biggest tax and spend redistribution of wealth that we will see in our lifetimes.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      But this is not where the government's rubbery figures end. The government also forgot to factor in the $10 billion in the slush fund for the leader of the Greens, to fund his pet causes and projects. Again, we were led to believe that this perhaps was not real money. We know that the Treasurer has had problems in the past with real money—he has problems with this concept—because in opposition he referred to the fact that a $600 per child payment was not 'real money'. I have news for the Treasurer: the money is real, and it comes from ordinary Australians.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      We know that the cost of the carbon tax will be around $1.5 billion between now and 2020. It is going to cost up to a trillion dollars over the coming decades. This is despite the fact that the Prime Minister in her own speech said that the price impact of the government's plan will be modest. A trillion dollars: I would hardly call that modest.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Now we come to the modelling. Only last sitting period, the Treasurer was forced to release new modelling to factor in those things that had not been factored in. Who can forget that the government modelling in the compensation arrangements they put forward was based on $20 a tonne when in fact they were bringing in a carbon tax with a starting price of $23 a tonne? In his most current press release on the modelling, the Treasurer acknowledged that the updated modelling covers the main impacts on the Australian economy of the Clean Energy Future package. However, including all elements of the plan was not feasible. So he is acknowledging in his own words that they cannot really properly fully model the impact. They either do not know or do not want us to know what the impact is going to be.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      We keep being reminded by the government that this is a wonderfully vital economic reform, yet by their own admission they cannot say what the impact is going to be and, more to the point, they cannot tell us who the 500 big polluters are. We know that the supposed 500 big polluters dipped down to around 400 and then went back up to 500. And yet, when specifically asked to name the supposedly hundreds of big polluters who are going to have to pay this carbon tax, the government cannot detail for us who they are.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      It is fair to say that if they cannot answer these fairly basic questions and if they cannot get basic programs like a pink batts program, or a solar homes program of only $850 million or a $350 million green program right, how on earth are they going to get the most complex change to the Australian economy right? We know that there is one thing they are consistent on, and that is budget blowouts. We know that they are very good at wasting taxpayer money, but we will all be paying for that.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      I would also like to talk about another thing that the government says is close to its heart and is very important, and that is jobs. The government is very good at talking about jobs and yet not very good at defending them. Let us analyse some of the numbers. Verso Economics recently found that, for every supposed green job created, 3.7 jobs were lost in other areas of the economy. Spain's

                                      found that, for every green job, 2.2 jobs were lost. Study after study demonstrates what we know to be correct, which is that with a carbon tax jobs will go, jobs will be lost. This government says that it is a matter of pride that it defends jobs, yet when the Prime Minister was asked to guarantee that not one job would be lost she would not give that guarantee. Why would she not give that guarantee? She would not give that guarantee because she knows the truth. The truth is the carbon tax will lead to a destruction of jobs.

                                       I have listened to the honourable member for Higgins, and she talked about being guillotined. She did not make a bad fist of it tonight in speaking. She had two goes, and I am sure she will come back for some more goes. It is just utter nonsense that we are listening to.

                                       This amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is only designed to delay the start of the carbon price. That is all it is designed to do. The government cannot support this amendment. I cannot support this amendment. The people in my electorate of Page want the certainty that this package of legislation is bringing. I have spoken to some of the people tonight, and they are pleased that it is happening.

                                       They talk about delays. Let me tell you about delays and what has happened. This is the culmination of a debate that has been running for almost two decades. I repeat: two decades. We have seen 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994. We have had a lot of discussion on these topics in this House already. This year alone there have been 225 questions asked on carbon pricing and over 15 separate MPI debates—more debacles than debates, but for form's sake I will call them debates. The clean energy debate has taken some 33 hours. There have been 120 speakers. Again, I ask: is that being guillotined? Significantly, this has been a longer debate than the former Howard coalition government allowed for the

                                       The time to act is now. That is what the government is doing. We must begin the transformation to a low-carbon economy, and this transformation begins with the passage of the clean energy bills. We have to put in place the incentive for business to invest in the clean energy technologies that will allow Australia to maintain its economic growth while cutting pollution. It is about being competitive. I am sure the opposition do not understand. Their only competition is really with the opposition leader wanting to come into this place in another position; it is about his job. The countries that pioneer the clean technologies that will allow this decoupling to occur will be the countries that see strong and consistent economic growth through the next century. These will be the countries that will be the most competitive. That is what this is about. It is about keeping Australia competitive.

                                       The alternative of the Leader of the Opposition's prescription is to do nothing. It is about pretending that climate change is not happening—heads buried totally in the sand—and it is about attacking the scientists who say that climate change is occurring and attacking the economists who state that a carbon price is the most efficient way of tackling the problem. I know there are many on the opposite side who believe that. By refusing to grapple with the challenges and opportunities of a carbon-constrained world—and that is what this clean energy package will transition us to—the Leader of the Opposition would rather see our economy stagnate and fall behind those of our competitors, as long as his political interests are served. That is how it looks to me and that is how it is increasingly looking to many others.

                                       Now that the Leader of the Opposition can see that he will not be able to stop this important reform, he attempts to delay it. Just get on with it. It is time to just do it. It is happening. This again betrays his inability to put the interests of the nation above his own narrow political interest. The fact is that we know that any delay to this important reform will not magically make it less costly. In fact, it will only increase the costs. Various studies have looked into the implications of delaying the introduction of a carbon price and all conclude that such delay is costly. We cannot ignore them. We ignore them at our peril. In addition, federal Treasury have consistently stated that delaying this crucial reform will only increase the costs of separating—

                                        I was listening very intently to my colleague across the chamber, the member for Page, about the importance, as she put it, of not delaying, of doing it right now, because it will increase costs at some point in the future. We know that this is simply based on a false assumption. It is based on the assumption that there is going to be a global consensus on carbon tax and on emissions trading schemes, and we know for a fact that this is not where the world is going. Let me tell you, while there may be some people in Page who might support you in this endeavour, I can certainly say that there are people in Higgins who do not. I know for a fact, because they have told me, that it is going to have a dramatic impact on their cost of living and on their way of life.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        I went out to speak to my electorate specifically on this issue. Just as the Prime Minister said she was going to wear out her shoe leather speaking to everybody about this, I not only talked the talk but also walked the walk. I had a community forum in my electorate on 27 July and had around 200 people turn up. People spoke there about the cost of living going up and they asked the question: what is the global environmental gain from this carbon tax? Self-funded retirees without a Commonwealth health card stated that they would be dramatically worse off. They know that they will not receive any payments from the government. They know as well that payments simply will not keep up. They know that every time they turn on the light, open a fridge, wash their clothes or turn on the air conditioner a carbon tax is going to mean it will cost them more. This is going to affect over 285,000 Australians, many of whom are in my electorate of Higgins, who have sacrificed and saved to fund themselves in their own retirement.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        During that forum that night I was also particularly struck by a very sobering dilemma faced by a small businessman, Mr Errol Mymin, the managing director of Timbermate Group, which manufacture and then export a unique product to 15 countries. He said, 'I make a 100 per cent locally made product of which 90 per cent is my raw material, and that is from Victoria.' He is already being hit by the high Australian dollar. He employs 18 people, 12 of whom are over the age of 50 years. He told the forum that the carbon tax and the 10 per cent hike in electricity will force him to consider relocating his business overseas. He expressed concern that many of the people that he employs would find it very difficult to get another job. He asked: how do you compensate people for the loss of a job? That is exactly the point—you cannot. He went on to say in an email to me, 'Comrade Combet'—who is sitting across the chamber here tonight—'refers to households, low earners and large polluters, but does no-one in Labor understand the people that will be hurt the most are the low-paid workers who will lose their jobs as they become too expensive and manufacturers move overseas?' That is the question that this government needs to answer.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        On Saturday, 18 September, I spoke with many small businesses in my electorate of Higgins who specifically run their businesses in Koornang Road, Carnegie. The chicken shop owner told me about the impact that the increased electricity prices will have on his business. The cafe owner said that it would make it harder for him to employ people when he had to cut costs to absorb as much as he could before passing on those remaining costs to consumers. The florist spoke to me about the fact that she has never seen such bad business conditions and that the added impact of the government's carbon tax would finish many businesses off. And on and on it went.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        But it is not just businesses, the people they employ and their families who are affected; it is also the services we use. I met with a not-for-profit hospital that has calculated that the carbon tax will increase its electricity bills by $345,000 per year. This hospital in my electorate of Higgins receives no compensation. It is not a multinational for-profit organisation. It is not a big polluter. It simply cannot absorb this cost. Imposing a carbon tax ultimately leads to one of three outcomes for this not-for-profit hospital: increased costs to patients, cuts to staff or both. People in business and the community understand the dangers of imposing a carbon tax. This government needs to understand the very real impact it will have on everyone's life here in Australia.

                                         We hear from the other side: 'What's the hurry? What's the big need for this legislation?' The facts in this debate are simple. Climate change is real. The evidence is overwhelming. We are already seeing the impacts of a changing climate. Human activities are triggering those changes, and we are witnessing it in the global climate. The

                                         advised that to avoid the worst effects of global warming we must stop short of 32 gigatonnes a year by 2020. It is worth noting that even this target is 'starting to seem impossibly optimistic.' We will act. It is important to act.

                                         I also hear: 'Why act early? We're going out before anyone else.' No, we are not. That is not at all true. As the minister explained today, that claim conveniently ignores the action that is occurring all around the world. It disregards that it is in our national interest to be part of that change, part of that competitive economy. China is spending one per cent of its

                                         on renewable energy. That is a huge market. We cannot afford to be left out of that. We want our slice of that. We cannot ignore the fact that we are the highest emitters per capita amongst developed economies. Our future prosperity does depend on us embracing change—on embracing a cleaner, carbon-free economy.

                                         I note that the minister also drew attention to the fact that 90 countries representing 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the global economy have now made pledges to undertake mitigation action. China, I know, intends to have a national scheme by 2015. So it is something we cannot afford not to be part of. We are not acting early. We are acting responsibly.

                                         People also say, 'Isn't this a great big tax on everything?' and 'Isn't this a Labor government that's putting the needs of working people aside?' No, that is not right. This is a typical Labor policy.

                                            This is good Labor policy that makes big polluters pay. It is a Labor policy that supports 90 per cent of households with any cost impacts. It supports all pensioners. It supports three million low-income families with a tax-free threshold rising from $6,000 to $18,000, which will support over 90 per cent of households. I would like to know if the Leader of the Opposition will stop those payments. Is it his style to stop the cheques, denying the Australian people the assistance they will need? Possibly.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            This is a Labor policy because it sustains industry. It absolutely invests into our current industry and the jobs they create. It also invests in innovation, in the future and in the environment. I note my colleague mentioned the impact on biodiversity if we do nothing. Australia leads the world in loss of biodiversity. That is not something we should be at all proud of. This is a very good effort to do something about that.
                                           </p>

                                            I have also heard across the chamber: 'We can't afford this; this impost is terrible.' I think they said that about slavery: 'We can't afford to get rid of slavery. We can't afford anything that prejudices our profits.' This is absolutely an argument that we hear every day from the opposition. 'We can't afford it. The sky will fall. The economy will be ruined.' This is the economy that has been recognised internationally as one of the strongest, most resilient economies in the world.

                                               colleagues in this federal parliament are here tonight. We have the member for Parramatta, the member for Newcastle, the member for Robertson, the member for Hughes and the honourable member for Mackellar, as well as me as the member for Riverina. New South Wales people are sensible people, as is everybody in this chamber. We know how vital it is that members of this chamber support the amendment to the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and accompanying bills to make commencement of the carbon tax contingent on a proclamation of the next parliament. Almost 14 months after the Prime Minister uttered those infamous words she will live to regret, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' Labor is about to impose the world's costliest carbon tax at a time of global economic despair. Labor is doing this without first taking it to the people of Australia—or is it? Yes, in fact it has already gone to the people of Australia. We have already polled members of the public, the voters of this great nation, as to what they thought of a carbon tax. The Greens' policy included a carbon tax in the lead-up to the 2010 election and they fielded candidates in each and every one of the 150 electorates across Australia. The votes came in and—guess what!—the Greens won just one seat and the other 149 electorates went to candidates who said they would not support a carbon tax. The people have already spoken. Australians resoundingly rejected a carbon tax then and, to be fair to the 12 ½ million voters, Labor should do the right thing and give the people another say. Labor needs to do this because it did not listen last time at the 2010 election.

                                               The coalition listens and acts accordingly—always. All of the coalition's recent major policy reforms—however challenging, confronting, difficult and electorally unpopular—were put to the people to decide. These included Fightback in 1993, the goods and services tax in 1998 and
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">

                                               in 2007—all taken to elections. The coalition accepted the will of the people. That is democracy. That is the Nationals-Liberal way. Labor ought to do the same thing with its carbon tax initiative and support this amendment and defer the introduction of the clean energy bills until the 44th Parliament.

                                               Remember this: those who back the Prime Minister do so at the behest of the unrepresentative Greens against the express wishes of the people they purport to serve and at their own peril at the next ballot. Voters have long memories. They will remember the great untruth they were fed before the last election. They will remember, if these 19 bills become law, the Independent and Labor members who did the double-cross. They will remember and will cast their vote accordingly. Labor does not have a mandate to introduce such a job-destroying, lifestyle-changing policy. This is bad policy from a bad government, which gets worse by the day. The Prime Minister will be, do and say anything to stay in the Lodge. She says she cares about jobs. In truth, she does: her job and those of some, if not all, of her frontbench. She cares not about many of her backbenchers because if she did she would not be introducing legislation which will do such irreparable harm to the now strong but soon to be devastated manufacturing and mining electorates they represent—seats once regarded as Labor heartland, which the Prime Minister in her haste to kowtow to the rabble that is the Greens surely knows will change at the next election. Here tonight is the opportunity for Labor MPs to do the right thing: show some conviction, some fortitude and some backbone. Support this amendment. Your leader might not like it, but your constituents surely will. This carbon tax is unpopular, unnecessary, unwanted and undemocratic.

                                               The member for Lyne wants to let the market rip. He repeated the same line to me just this afternoon, but let us not rip out jobs, family incomes and hope for the future for the sake of a whim of the Greens who want a carbon tax. We hear so often from those opposite about clean energy jobs, but what are they and where are they? The price of carbon will start at $23 per tonne, which will add to the cost of everything we do every day of our lives yet will do nothing for the environment. Even on Labor's own figures, it will rip a trillion dollars out of the national wealth over the next 40 years. It will make our businesses less competitive. It will be a $515 a year slug to Australian families and it will cost jobs.

                                                I take the opportunity to speak in the consideration in detail stage of the clean energy bills, having already spoken in the second reading debate, to do two things that have developed since I last spoke. The first is to address the disgraceful vote today on the Steel Transformation Plan Bill 2011, which those opposite, who claim to be concerned for the welfare of people in the steel industry, failed to support and which would provide very important, strategic and needed support to the steel industry. In particular, I could not believe my colleague

                                                , the member for Gilmore, sat on the other side of the House and voted against the Steel Industry Transformation Plan, and no doubt Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who has an office in my area, will also vote against that bill.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                The reality is that the steel industry at this time needs those opposite to support this bill. I point out to those opposite that BlueScope as a company have made it quite clear that the carbon tax is not the issue that they are confronting. They are confronting the international circumstances and the level of the Australian dollar. The Leader of the Opposition took the opportunity to come to the Illawarra, go to the steelworks and make a big song and dance about the carbon price. I very much doubt that he will be back to explain to them why he led his party in voting against the bill that was before the House today. In fact, the bill was put separately and those opposite could have supported it if they had wanted to but still chose not to do so.

                                                In my region we are always at the forefront of innovating our industries for the future. The steel industry is an important part of the story of developing the new technologies that will be needed for a cleaner energy future. We understand that and we are working to support the steel industry. We also understand that other manufacturers—for example, David Brown Gears in my area have recently got contracts to do gear work for wind farms—see the opportunities that will develop from a greener energy future. It is important for the long-term future of this country that we begin to take up the opportunities that are on offer and position ourselves for the jobs in a cleaner energy future. Those opposite got this not so long ago. In every one of their contributions to this debate they want to ignore the fact that until the change of leadership on their side they backed taking action on climate change—

                                                    Sadly for them, that is not the evidence of their own cabinet when they were in government, as has been outlined by many in this debate. Their own cabinet in government, of which the current Leader of the Opposition was a member, supported bills, actions and policies to put a price on carbon and to introduce a market based system to put that price in place. Now, of course, they want to rewrite history. At that point in time they were not saying it was a devastating outcome for jobs. What they were saying was that it was an important new opportunity for us as a nation to move into a greener future and to find the jobs of the future. So all the crocodile tears that we hear now, which are never backed up by action to support jobs such as voting in support of the Steel Transformation Plan, are absolutely contradictory to the record of their own party and their own decisions and, indeed, their own government when they were in government in this country. I am very disappointed that my colleague the member for Gilmore and, no doubt, the senator in the other place will not vote in support of local jobs in the Illawarra. It is a real shame that they cannot look beyond their own political message and support local jobs. I express my support in the belief that this will create opportunities as well for jobs in my regions and, more broadly, across the nation.

And all this for what? Certainly not to help the environment. A carbon tax will not lower global temperatures by one degree, will not lower sea levels by one millimetre. If, as the member for Melbourne so hysterically foretold in his speech in this debate, the seas are rising due to the catastrophic climate change, why is it that so many of the doomsayers are still happy to live on the ocean's edge? For every alarmist scientist after their next funding grant who will tell you we are facing 'dangerous climate change', I can show you a salt-of-the-earth generational farmer who will be just as convincing with his assurances that the only thing which changes is the weather.

                                                        Before I get to the substantive contribution, about the international linking of permits, that I would like to make to tonight's debate, I have to make a comment on that farcical claim of the member for Riverina that he stands shoulder to shoulder with the hard workers in the manufacturing sector, having today absolutely opposed a $300 million steel transformation package. When we are growing up we get great moral advice from our parents: beware the fake friends. That is what we have seen from the opposition: the fake friends of the working man and woman, shoulder to shoulder. The only time they would be shoulder to shoulder with you is when they were going to take something from you. That is the big difference between the policies on this side of the chamber and those on the other side of the chamber. The policies we see the Liberal-National coalition putting together would have every household in my electorate—indeed, every household in every electorate around the entire country—paying $1,300. They would take it out of the pockets of ordinary workers, with whom they would never stand shoulder to shoulder. And what do they propose to do with that? They would give it to the polluters. That is the truth of the scheme that is proposed by those who oppose us this evening.

                                                        Hypocrisy is rank in this place with the comments from those opposite. In December 2009 the member for Sturt, the Manager of Opposition Business, said:

                                                        Yet today we see them voting against a scheme that will ensure that we do respond to that climate change action. As a Labor member I am very proud to stand here and say that we will be making sure that, as this economy undertakes a significant shift towards a clean energy future, we position ourselves to take advantage of all the new clean industries that will emerge around the world in that new context. In contrast, we have those on the other side just pooh-poohing and being negative, saying, 'No, no, no'—a strident voice of opposition to any sense of the future with our participation in that new clean economy.

                                                        I want to get some facts on the record this evening. Australia's carbon price is going to be linked to carbon markets around the world and that will happen from the start of the flexible price period. It is important that Australians get some truth about what is going on, because those opposite are masters of misrepresentation of the program that we have organised well—and it is sitting right there, in all that legislation ready to bring forward. We will be allowing the reduction in carbon pollution to be pursued globally at the lowest cost. The Prime Minister today, I think, made the point that carbon pollution is absolutely not confined to national borders.

                                                        Murphy, you might be of an age to remember a very powerful visual image in the 1960s. I think it was on the front cover of
                                                        <i>

                                                        magazine when the Apollo trip to the moon looked back and took pictures of the earth. We saw the blue seas, we saw the green and brown land shapes and we saw that the entire planet is in fact connected—that we all breathe the same air. Because there are no national borders and carbon pollution is an international reality affecting the whole planet, international linking of carbon markets will allow businesses that release carbon in one country to be matched up with businesses in other countries that are able to reduce their carbon pollution at lower costs. This is very important because international linking encourages action to reduce carbon pollution around the whole world and plays an important role in helping not just advanced economies such as ours—a very successful economy; indeed, the envy of the world—but developing countries to adopt clean technologies. This international linking will start when the flexible price comes in on 1 July 2015. I look forward to making more comments about this as the evening progresses.

                                                         Australia, which owns Riverina Beef near Yanco—between Leeton and Narrandera, in my electorate—has had discussions with the Gillard government over the impact of the carbon tax on the company, which employs about 2,000 people and processes about 1,600 head of cattle over 11 shifts five days a week. That is, 500 people with more than 30,000 head of stock currently in the feedlot which uses world's best practice in everything it does.

                                                         Mr Berry warns that the carbon tax will create a two-tiered meat processing industry—of big abattoirs forced to pay the carbon tax without compensation and smaller operations which do not—and it will add costs to an industry which is one of the biggest employers in some rural and regional areas. JBS Australia also owns abattoirs at Dinmore, Townsville, Rockhampton and Toowoomba in Queensland, which may be above the threshold of 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. Mr Berry summed up the feelings of many when he said the carbon tax policy had been poorly thought through and that the Yanco facility was facing an additional cost of $5 to $6 extra per head of cattle which was not being borne by its domestic competitors and the big players in its key export markets. Exports make up the bulk of the company's production. Mr Berry said Yanco would be forced to pay the carbon tax—an estimated $678,000 slug—while smaller abattoirs owned by competitors would not face the $23 a tonne price on emissions.

                                                         , now co-owned by Teys Australia, is also extremely worried about the introduction of a carbon tax. The industry, despite the bulk of its output being produced for export, is unlikely to receive trade exposed industry assistance. Mr Berry has had talks with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joe Ludwig, and staff from the office of the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, and has invited bureaucrats from Canberra to tour a JBS Australia site. I hope it was not the case that he was talking to a wall. The company has calculated that the carbon tax will cost it about $1.8 million a year and it expects to pay $1.5 million in higher electricity prices while smaller operators in the industry will not be taxed.

Riverina Beef is one of four JBS Swift owned Australian abattoirs which supply the Malaysian market with halal products from Australia. The standards required are very high, but it is a good market with a lot of opportunities, Mr Berry said. JBS Swift represents 25 per cent of beef sold in Malaysia and more than 30 per cent of offal. The group, which consisted of JBS Swift representatives as well as 12 guests from Malaysia, were given a tour of the Riverina Beef plant and feedlot. The Leeton Shire Council mayor, Paul Maytom, also attended as he is also concerned about the effects a carbon tax could have on the local government area.

                                                         It is typical of Labor stalling tactics to put off Mr Berry and his request to receive assistance on this carbon tax, knowing full well that it will not go away. This is in the year of so-called 'delivery and decision'. That is why the amendment to the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and accompanying bills to make the commencement of the carbon tax on a proclamation of the next parliament is so essential, so that people can have a say and companies such as JBS Australia can have confidence, knowing that such economy-changing legislation will not simply be forced upon them in such an undemocratic and unjustifiable way. JBS does not need to be thwarted in its attempts to help our balance of payments and to ensure that it continues to employ hundreds of good people in my electorate and other electorates and to ensure sustainability for the Leeton and Narrandera shires.

Before I start, I would just like to take issue with some of the comments made by the member for Riverina. He should not be surprised about that because I do tend to take issue with most things that he says in this House.

I am a strong supporter of this suite of bills. I have been for a very long time a strong supporter of a clean energy future and for introducing measures to combat climate change. I am doing the right thing, and I am, most importantly, doing the right thing by the will of the Canberra people.

                                                          Most of the Canberra people I speak to in my mobile offices when I am out doorknocking and when I am on the phone to them, and in the emails and letters that I get from them, want this legislation. They want a clean energy future for their children. They want a clean energy future for their grandchildren, their children's children. I am doing the right thing, as the member for Riverina implored, and I am doing the right thing by the people of Canberra.

                                                          The member for Riverina also mentioned the fact that we need to do the economically and fiscally responsible thing. This is the economically and fiscally responsible thing. This will ensure Australia's continued future prosperity. This will ensure continued jobs. It will ensure continued growth. It will ensure that Australia continues to compete in the world for future generations. It will ensure that this country continues to prosper in the future.

                                                          I can now come back to my speech, having addressed those issues that the member for Riverina implored me to do. This week in this chamber we will see a turning point in this nation's future. It will be a week when the rhetoric and posturing will end and members will be asked to cast a vote that will decide whether this country tackles the problem of carbon pollution and embraces a clean energy future. It will decide whether or not this country will ensure a prosperous future for my nieces, my great-nieces, my great-nephews, my godchildren and their godchildren.

                                                          It is not over yet—we have still tomorrow to come—but, in getting us to this point, I particularly want to acknowledge and thank the dedicated members of the Public Service. Those opposite will probably scorn the Public Service because they have a strong tradition of doing that. They scorned them so much in 1996 that they sacked tens of thousands of them and sent Canberra into a recession when the rest of Australia was growing. So it would not surprise me if we are going to get public servants abused in the process of this debate tonight. If they ever become a government, they want to sack 12,000 public servants, I think. So we can see what those opposite think of the Public Service, the dedicated public servants who serve this nation fearlessly and tirelessly—the invisible heroes. Tonight I want to acknowledge those invisible heroes and thank them for their service to this country.

So I have seen firsthand the dedication of the public servants who work in that agency, the quality of the advice that they provide and the thankless tasks that at times they had to perform. I saw a man here today whom I remember having a meeting with at 9 am a few years ago. He had actually just come into the office after spending the whole day and night there, working tirelessly trying to ensure a clean energy future and a solution to climate change. He had just gone home, had a shower and come back for another full day's work after working round the clock. This was typical of the work in the department and typical of the dedication of those public servants. I thank them.

I invite her, like I invited the Prime Minister, to come to the Riverina and talk to the hardworking farmers, families, businesspeople and all the industries who will be affected by the carbon tax that she and her Labor colleagues are going to foist upon our people. The Prime Minister said she would wear out her shoe leather talking to people across Australia, but she certainly did not respond when I wrote to her to invite her to come to the Riverina to wear out some of her shoe leather talking to my constituents. I am sure that when I write to the member for Canberra—which I will do in the morning—to invite her to the Riverina, she will respond. She may not come to the Riverina, but I am sure she will give me the courtesy of a response.

                                                           The costs and job losses from this carbon tax are going to be compounded in regional Australia and certainly in the Riverina. The member for Canberra will find that out if she goes down the highway to meet the good people of the Riverina and if she talks to them about what the carbon tax will mean to them. When the Prime Minister announced the big new tax on 10 July—carbon Sunday—she said that nine out of 10 households would receive compensation. But millions of middle-income families will be worse off. For those who will receive financial assistance, the government cannot or will not say for how long. How could anyone trust this government, which is being told what to do by the Greens? It is being led by the nose by the Greens. How else could you explain that the

How else could you explain that the Greens—and there are only 10 of them out of the 226 elected upper and lower house MPs—not only knew about the carbon tax but also had significant input into its planning over many weeks, while 103 Labor backbenchers were told about the details of the tax during a teleconference on the morning of carbon Sunday? That is why Labor is so divided.

                                                           Professor Ross Garnaut revealed what could aptly be described as an inconvenient truth in his updated climate review report when he said, 'Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost.' In the European Union, its emissions trading scheme raised $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion between 2005 and 2011. The Gillard government's proposed carbon tax will raise $9 billion a year—more money in the first three months than the European scheme has raised in 5½ years. Already Gillard Labor has foreshadowed, courtesy of these bills, three new bureaucracies: the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the

The Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' She has failed to honour her promise to the Australian people. She has failed to honour her promise to those hardworking backbenchers who are now extremely worried about their political futures. The next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax which will drive up the cost of living for all Australian families and will cost local jobs. The $9 billion carbon tax means a 10 per cent hike in electricity bills in the first year alone—and on and on and on. Support this amendment and at least do the right thing by your constituents.

                                                              What is equally disturbing are the constant implied attacks on the scientific community not only of this country but around the world. I want to refer to some of the rhetoric we have heard from the member for Riverina and the member for Higgins, who bring into this chamber stories of people they have spoken to and their concerns about the implications of this legislation. They do not talk about their alternative policy, which would cost them 2½ times as much. They do not talk about the fact that it would impact on their livelihoods and on their businesses 2½ times as much. They do not tell them that their policy would reward the large polluters. They do not tell them that their policy would not achieve the five per cent emission reduction target by 2020, which they have committed to, and they do not tell them that their policy is entirely reliant on 60 per cent of the carbon being sequestered into our soils—which they know is unachievable. If they are going to criticise our policy while committing to an emissions reduction target and pretending that they accept the science on global emissions, they should at least be honest enough to compare the two policies when talking to the people that approach them.

                                                              I come back to the issue of questioning and challenging the scientific community. Quite frankly, it does disturb me, because I have spoken to countless scientists both from this country and from overseas and I have yet to find one scientist working in the climate science field today that does not accept the science. I have yet to find one academy of science that refutes the science. I have yet to find one national government that refutes the science. It seems to me that, if members are going to come into this place and question the science, they ought to be honest about their position rather than say, 'We question the science, but we will commit to a five per cent emissions reduction target by 2020.' That is the height of hypocrisy. You cannot have it both ways. Either accept one position or the other.

                                                              The reality is that this country has benefited over the years from the work of our scientific community. We have benefited in incredible ways. We accept their advice and their opinions when it suits us, but we reject it and pretend that they are part of some conspiracy when we do not like the advice that they are providing. Quite frankly, that is not only absurd but an insult to the good men and women of this country and around the world who are genuinely concerned about this issue, who in some cases have devoted their lives to researching this issue and who know that we ought to be acting, and the sooner we start the easier our task will become. They also know that if we do not act—and, yes, we have to act in conjunction with other countries—the consequences for the planet and for future generations will be absolutely disastrous.

The reason for that is very straightforward and simple. Six days prior to the election, the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.' This is the statement that was designed to attract votes and to say, 'You can trust me, I will not give you this great big tax.' This was deliberately designed to allay the suspicions and fears that the Australian people had about this woman who had knifed the previous leader and usurped power—Lady Macbeth, by any term.

It is the government that runs a fear campaign. Let me give you an example. Mr Combet said to this House that a report had shown there is a significant risk to human health, to agriculture, to cities, to infrastructure and to natural heritage from the more severe climate impacts over the longer term and sea levels will rise, the implication being that houses will fall into the sea. Yet this same minister, when he chose to buy a house that was not in his electorate but on the foreshores of Newcastle, said in an interview to the

Because they could not form government, they have decided to take a politically opportunistic approach to this issue. What we have seen from them is absolute hypocrisy, and the member for Makin clearly pointed that out. In this debate, we have heard the member for Mackellar talk about how the seas are not really rising, saying that this is all a fabrication, people's imagination. We have heard the member for Riverina dispute the science and say: 'There's no point in acting. We shouldn't act, we shouldn't do anything about climate change.' This is what those on the other side have done: they have disputed the science and they have said that the rest of the world is not acting, so why should we. They have put forward inaccuracies followed by inaccuracies, one after the other. In fact, if the opposition really believe that there is no merit in acting, that we should not act on climate change—as opposed to what is being advanced by this side—then why do they have a five per cent reduction target? Why do they want to spend $45 billion of taxpayers' money?

Well, the only communist proposition that has been put before the Australian people is the opposition's proposal, their direct action plan, where those in government have command and control, and will choose the winners. In government, they would spend $46 billion of taxpayers' money—

It will cost the average household $1,300 a year. But you would take that and give it to the big polluters. You would make it government directed and government controlled—forget the market, forget any market principles. As I have said before in this place, it is no surprise when the National Party let go of their market principles; that is pretty much expected from the National Party. But for the Liberal Party to forget their market principles, to say, 'We don't want the market; we want government intervention,' is unique. It certainly shows that they are all about political opportunism.

There has been a huge fear campaign about what these clean energy bills will do to the cost of living. Let us look at the facts, not the fear. I will go through the estimated price impact on families. Per week, the impact of the carbon price, as modelled by Treasury, is less than $1 per week, on average. Electricity will go up $3.30 per week and gas $1.50 per week. The cost of dairy and related products, which have been talked about, will rise by less than 10c a week as an average impact on households; bread and cereal products, less than 10c a week; meat and seafood, around 10c per week; fruit and vegetables, 10c a week; non-alcoholic drinks and snack foods, 10c a week—

It does add up, Member for Bowman—it adds up to $9.90. With our compensation, nine out of 10 families will receive assistance. Under the opposition's plan, the $46 billion that they will rip away from households, there is no compensation, no assistance and no tax cuts. In fact, the opposition will claw back those tax concessions—

The price of men's clothing will increase by less than 10c a week; women's clothing, less than 10c a week; children's and infants' clothing, less than 10c a week; footwear, less than 10c a week; and the list goes on. This clearly demonstrates objective modelling, which shows that the opposition's fear campaign is exactly that. The opposition need to come clean about their own plan's impact on families. As I said, it is $1,300 per year that the opposition will take from taxpayers. Every single taxpayer will have to pay for the opposition's subsidised polluters policy.

It also showed that we are also the parties more trusted to deal with the economy, to deal with interest rates, to deal with all the matters that are of importance to the Australian people. For you people to sit there and fly in the face of the Australian people when you only got elected because you misled the people into believing you would not impose a carbon tax is a huge insult to the Australian people. That is why this amendment has been moved, to ensure that the Australian people can have a say. If you had an ounce of decency you would say that you accept that you were elected because the Prime Minister promised the people there would be no carbon tax.

The point I made about scaremongering on the part of the government is because you are so disingenuous. You scare the people and yet you choose simply to say that you are the only people who believe in the science. There are many scientists who disagree with the ones that agree with you and those who disagree with you do not get funded. They make the point that they are entitled to be funded to do their research as well. The bottom line is this: the people are entitled to have a say before this penalty is imposed upon them.

The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition concerns yet another delay, an attempt by the opposition yet again to delay action on climate change. The member for Riverina, who spoke earlier, is quite new to this House, but the member for Mackellar and many of the other people in the House have been here long enough to know the history and how long the debate on climate change has been going on.
                                                                                                    </p>

At that stage the Labor Party was campaigning on signing the Kyoto protocol. I ran an extensive campaign in my electorate way back in 2004 on that aspect of climate change. It was well received in my electorate and in the electorates of many of my Labor colleagues. In 2007, both sides of this House, the government and the opposition, went to the electorate promising action on climate change through a market based mechanism. The two policies were different. The opposition policy was for a three-year fixed price which they did not call at tax time.

Therefore the member for Parramatta has to explain why it should not be held up until after there has been an election and give reasons why it has to be put now. That is not what she is doing.

In 2007, the Labor side went to the election with an emissions trading scheme with a one-year fixed price. During the term from 2007 to 2009, when it was finally rejected in the Senate, we had a white paper, a green paper, an exposure draft, debate in this House and two Senate inquiries. The opposition of the time negotiated with the government on an outcome and the parties agreed on it. Then overnight there was an opposition leadership change and the opposition changed their policy after four years of consistency on this policy. The shame of it is that on this side we know that this is a policy blip on the part of the opposition. Once their leadership changes again, they will revert to their natural policy position, which is to support a market mechanism as they did in 2007, 2008 and 2009. When that happens, they will realise they lost this opportunity by not entering into the debate on this.
                                                                                                      </p>
                                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                                       Australia is an interesting country. The Australian people tend to pick one party in the state government, one party in the federal government and a balance-of-power, minor party in the Senate. They require us as a government and an opposition to work together to get our bills through, and every government in Australian history, with the exception perhaps of the Howard government when it had a majority in the Senate, has done exactly that. The government and the opposition have worked together to find a path through. It is the working together of both sides which causes stability in this country. It means that when governments change we do not flip-flop from one side of the policy to the other because we have worked together to find a position which we can both support. You have lost an opportunity here. You have lost a real opportunity to be part of a major reform.

I would think that members opposite if they were desirous of thinking about their own future might well be disposed to supporting the amendment.
                                                                                                       </p>

In the time that I have been here I have not seen a government that ostensibly argues that it ought to be well received by the Australian community because it saved us from a global financial crisis and that it has maintained unemployment levels at relatively low numbers and the Australian community ought to be grateful that it has delivered that outcome. How is it that it has lost that support that it might have otherwise expected that those policy prescriptions about which it boasts might have delivered?
                                                                                                       </p>

The policy prescription has been delivered because they did that deal with the Greens and it is very necessary for the government to produce legislation that they know in their heart of hearts the Australian people do not support. I suspect that if they were desirous of thinking about their own future—and I gather that some of them are contemplating whether they ought to have a slight shift in direction—then if they do shift in a slightly different direction their thinking is how might they be able to survive. I think the reasoning that I see coming through over and over again is that if they did have a change in leadership, they might well be able to strike out in a new direction to put this matter off the agenda and to be able to focus on what they believe are the positive arguments in support of their own situation.
                                                                                                       </p>

This is an amendment which is a particularly useful opportunity for some members of the government who think they might be able to hang on in their marginal seats because they would get it off the political agenda. This is a serious matter.

I have recently travelled to the United States and I have had the opportunity of talking to a number of people who are very interested in public life in the United States of America. This is not a matter that is on their agenda. This matter has largely been driven off the public agenda in the United States because of the other serious issues that confront their economy. The government argues that we know that they are not going to deal with it nationally but hopefully some of the states are. It is very interesting. One of the signposts was the

There is little prospect that the United States is going to buy into the sort of agenda that we are buying into here, and with so few other countries buying into this, it will leave us dangerously exposed. Any claims that the government has delivered us a reasonable standard of living will be quickly lost in a situation where we become even less competitive in a very competitive world.

Often you have to pay to see acts of contortion and tonight we got one for free. That twisted logic that said to us that we needed to accept their idea or their proposition of an amendment to save ourselves is something else. We are being asked to delay action and it is said that that would provide some benefit when the reality is that, for every year we have delayed acting in trying to meet a bipartisan target of cutting emissions by five per cent by 2020, from 2015 there is $5 billion in cost that we would have to engage in to catch up to make that target. We are being asked to delay action and in effect assume huge costs in the process.

A mere one per cent has impacts on Australia. The frequency, the duration, the intensity and the spread of climactic events in this country and the impacts that they have are real and they have been outlined in the Climate Commission's report, which members opposite can access. After Cyclone Yasi we saw in one year a decrease in economic growth of one per cent—$13 billion—and inflationary impacts of up to 0.8 per cent. That was from one climactic event.

At the same time those opposite, by virtue of their amendment, ask us to delay and to wait—for what? At the point when they get in, what will they do? In a speech that the Leader of the Opposition gave to this chamber he dedicated 3,743 words in response to the Prime Minister, 244 of which actually outlined what they were proposing to do. What is interesting in this debate is not just what is said but also what is not said by those opposite and what they propose to do by in effect forcing us to delay implementation. To then not outline what they propose to do to meet their bipartisan target is completely irresponsible to the Australian public.

We simply cannot afford to wait. This is what their amendment would seek for us to do. It would make us wait and delay further any action.

We have, I think it has been said, one per cent of emissions, and we will make no impact on what is going to happen to the rest of the world. That is the point that Hugh White is making. It is the point I think that is well understood. He goes on and says:
                                                                                                                 </p>

Two years after the collapse at Copenhagen, momentum for a global plan is stalled. As the global economy teeters, this year's Durban follow-up meeting is expected to mark time.
                                                                                                                 </p>

That is simply the point that somebody as well respected as Hugh White is making. He goes on to say:

It is as simple as that.

You may talk about the strength of the Australian economy, but implementing this legislation will leave us considerably worse off. That is the bottom line.
                                                                                                                 </p>

I made it clear that my speech was not a commentary on the science. If there were a global response I would want Australia to be part of it. But I cannot see why Australia should be out there largely in isolation. I have heard the arguments about what is said to be happening in the rest of the world. I cannot see it. I have participated in conferences abroad and discussed these issues with others who would have some knowledge of what is happening in their situations. Countries are backing off, because they cannot afford in this matter to go it alone in the way in which this government wants to.
                                                                                                                 </p>

I think supporting this amendment would in fact get them off the hook. I think they are in a perilous situation as a government. I think they have little prospect of surviving in the situation of implementing legislation that was not part of their agenda. I remember a Prime Minister who went to the Australian people on the basis that there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead'.

It is of no surprise that the opposition have sought this amendment to push back the introduction of any action on climate change. We have heard a number of members on the other side of this chamber give their reasons why they oppose the action on climate change and these bills of the government. We have had members who state that they believe in climate change but then at the same time say that they do not believe human activity is contributing to greenhouse gases at all. In other words, they believe that there should be no action because they do not believe in the science. There are those who say it is not the right time because of the global economic circumstances or, as we heard from the member for Berowra, it is not the right time because they think that we are acting before other countries, ignoring all of the information and evidence out there that many, many countries—89 countries, in fact—have actually signed up to taking action and seeking to achieve the same targets that this government is seeking to achieve.

He said those words in a speech at the Inaugural Virginia Chadwick Memorial Foundation Lecture in Sydney on 21 July 2011. I also quote the member for Wentworth in National Press Gallery Questions and Answers on 3 August 2011:

There is one member on the other side who actually gets the importance of this action, who actually understands the importance of these bills. It is unfortunate, however, that when the time came this afternoon to stand up and have the conviction of his own words, his own beliefs, that member sat there quietly, opposing the bills.

We have heard that this government through these bills will provide assistance to households. If we had not come into government, on 1 July 2012 there would be a tax introduced, but it would be a 1.5 per cent tax on business that would flow through in full to consumers and to households with no assistance, and the leader who would be introducing this 1.5 per cent tax has said previously, 'I would introduce this tax over my dead body.' It would be the opposition's paid parental leave scheme, a tax of 1.5 per cent with no assistance given, compared to what this government is introducing, which is a 0.7 per cent

Even if you think that this carbon tax is the best thing since sliced bread; even if you swallow hook, line and sinker that this carbon tax is going to cool the planet or that it will hold back the rise of the oceans; even if you believe that unless you pay this carbon tax the reef will be gone, the polar bears are going to die and we will all be doomed; even if you are one of those individuals who love big government; even if you are one of those who are aboard the carbon tax gravy train—a gravy train to be funded by families and small business through higher electricity prices; and even if you are one of those foreign carbon traders who will be enriched by this scheme, I ask you to stop, to pause and to think of the damage that passing this legislation will do to our democratic system without this amendment.
                                                                                                                   </p>

That is the promise that everyone sitting on the other side of the chamber was elected on. But earlier today the very same government led by the Prime Minister—the Prime Minister for the mean time, anyway—voted to impose the world's biggest carbon tax upon our nation. What an outright betrayal of our democratic principles. And here it is: 19 pieces of legislation, 1,129 pages, over one-quarter of a million words. Is there anyone sitting over there on that side of the chamber who can honestly say that they have read all this legislation and understood it? I bet not. This is the most radical piece of legislation in the last decade. It is being rammed through parliament in an underhanded and undemocratic way.
                                                                                                                   </p>

The power of this parliament is vested in the freely expressed will of the people. That is something that you lot should never forget. But this carbon tax is not the freely expressed will of the people. Despite millions spent on propaganda to manipulate public opinion, despite the scare campaigns and the gross distortions, the electorate remains overwhelmingly opposed to this tax. While those that bleat like mindless sheep—

To those who say they respect the science, that is fine, but I say you firstly respect our democracy. But the actions of this government to deny the public a vote on this bill says a lot about the ideology of those who sit opposite. They have no respect for our democracy. They believe that they are a group of privileged elites and that they know better than the public. They do not care about the will of the people. They do not care about the importance of our democracy. That is why the community is so angry.

What I am concentrating my comments on is not the legislation, not the amendments, not the comedy act of the member for Berowra—as he twisted and turned when he tried to explain his position and his party's position on this amendment—and not the words of the sceptic member for Mackellar when she stood up and referred to 'so-called climate change'; I am looking at this amendment from the Leader of the Opposition that we have before us here—this amendment that is about doing nothing.
                                                                                                                             </p>

They are very good at giving excuses for why we should do nothing. They are very good at saying 'even if you believe', which obviously leads those of us on this side of the parliament to think that they do not believe that such a thing as climate change exists. That is why they want to do nothing. That is why they are not prepared to act now. They do not believe that the extreme climate events that we have been subjected to in our country and throughout the world have anything to do with climate change; rather, they think that we should sit on our hands and do absolutely nothing. The member for Mackellar referred to the polling, saying, 'These polls look pretty good at the moment, so why don't we push for an election and hope that we might end up with Tony in the Lodge?'

I am compelled to speak on this issue because I believe that the people of Macarthur deserve a chance to have their say when it comes to the biggest tax change in Australia's history. This government has no mandate to introduce this carbon tax legislation. Before the last election the Prime Minister said there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. The Treasurer said, 'We have made our position very clear; we have ruled it out.' And the Minister for

We must not mislead them into trusting false claims and promises; instead, we should listen to them and ensure that their opinions are heard, especially when we are talking about the biggest tax change in our country's history.

This will have a significant impact on the Australian economy, driving up electricity prices by 10 per cent and putting thousands of jobs at risk. Residents in my electorate are already doing it tough. Some are struggling to pay their bills and others require vouchers to pay for electricity and food. How can anyone support a tax which will mean higher electricity bills, increased grocery prices and job losses with no environmental gain? Tell that to the people of Macarthur.

The average punter can tell you that now is the worst possible time to introduce a new tax that will drive down Australia's economy, especially while international economic conditions are so uncertain. If the government's legislation is passed, Australians will pay an extra $9 billion a year in tax, but Australia's emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes to 628 million tonnes by 2020. On top of the tax itself an extra $3.5 billion will have to be spent on purchasing foreign carbon credits each year by 2020.

At least 80 per cent of the crowd was against the carbon tax and was very vocal with regard to the effect it will have on their families. It was clear that these people resent the fact that they did not have the opportunity to vote on this tax during the last election. They like all Australians have the right to voice their opinion on this tax, which is why it should be deferred until after an election.

Our role is to represent the people of Australia in this parliament and we should all aim to keep faith with the people who live in our electorates. There must be many Labor MPs opposite who will not be able to look at themselves in the mirror tonight after passing this carbon tax today. This carbon tax is based on a lie and it is a broken promise made to a nation that genuinely wants to improve the environment but not at the cost of our jobs, our livelihoods or our children's futures.

When we sit down and have a look at this, we see that this is the culmination of a debate that has been running for almost two decades. For 20 years we have talked about climate change and taking action on it. We have seen something like 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994. There has been a lot of discussion about this and so far the only people taking action—

While it is true that there was a wide-ranging debate earlier, the ruling of the other Deputy Speaker narrowed the debate. Unless we have a ruling to the contrary, I think that the member has to be pulled right back to the very strict meaning of the amendments as moved.

There is an opportunity here for government members, by supporting the opposition's amendment, to recover some policy and political legitimacy around this debate. Time and time again there are examples of where the government has failed to understand the impact of its changes. Even the Victorian government study, undertaken by Deloittes Access Economics, makes the point that the parameters that the Commonwealth has used in its modelling assumes zero employment impacts. That is the assumption. Yet when you actually look at the impacts, in my electorate alone, by 2015 an estimated 1,385 will be lost in the City of Frankston and Mornington Peninsula Shire areas and some $154 million of economic output will be lost. Time and time again these facts are brought before the government and it has failed to address them.

What a nonsense argument that is. His actions and the government's carbon tax policy are impacting on demand. It is already undermining small business viability and is hollowing out employment in that important sector.

It is an amendment about timing. I want to reiterate some important words to the House. I will quote the policy to be accurate. It says:

The Australian economy depends more on fossil fuels for its wealth generation and power supply than most developed economies and we are a significant supplier of energy to the world. Adjusting to a carbon-constrained economy will entail costs. We cannot change the structure of our economy overnight and we need to manage the transition with care.

Those opposite now would have us believe that the Australian people are not up to this task. They are up to this task.

It is because the Prime Minister, during the last election campaign, said that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led. Yet, what we have got in this House are 1,200 pages of new legislation. It is one of the greatest pieces of misleading information that any Prime Minister has ever bestowed on the Australian people.

They look at the policies from the opposing sides of the House. It is a contest of ideas: whom do they really trust to elect on policies to lead this nation? It is a very important decision the people take. All we say is: take this package of bills back to the people of Australia and ask them. Do not ask this House; ask the people of Australia. That is what our amendment says: that there be no vote taken on this until the people of Australia have been asked.

I went out and searched for someone in western Queensland who might support these bills. I went to Charleville—I thought I might find someone there as it was once a stronghold of the Labor Party; there is still an office of the

I could not find anyone there, so I went on to Quilpie. I thought I would find someone there, but there was no-one. I went further out, to Eromanga into the oilfields and I caught up with Dick Loveday. He was loading cattle to take them 1,100 kilometres from far out in western Queensland in my electorate to a processing plant near Toowoomba. He has been branded one of those big polluters because he is taking his cattle on road trains that create jobs and create export income. He said, 'Give us a go at these bills. We want to vote on these bills. We are sick and tired of working for nothing and all we see are taxes, taxes, taxes from this government. Just give us a say.'

It may take some time for a truly effective international framework for emissions reductions to emerge. It is likely that in the near term progress will be made through national and bilateral actions. A domestic emissions trading system, investment in low emissions technologies and energy efficiency measures in Australia will create opportunities as the international framework emerges.

It is an extensive statement, but I just want to go to the conclusion so that it can be put on the record of this place. In terms of the time frame that we are looking at here, there have been, as many speakers have said, two decades of debate on these issues. We got to a point in July 2007 where there was bilateral agreement and the very issues that attempts are being made to undermine by the arguments of those opposite were in fact their policy and printed for the world to see at that point in time.

However a substantive emissions management strategy is being developed as part of each mining operation to ensure that emissions are controlled.

The development of new underground roadways separate from the old and existing mine workings, supports the sealing off of these old workings and prevents waste gasses from being included in our mine's ventilation system. Into the future the company is committed to utilising ventilation controls, the sealing of old mining areas and gas drainage techniques that will allow the capture and flaring of gas."

It is apparent that the direct impacts of the carbon tax will be minimised and this is not expected to impinge on future growth of the company.

Gujarat NRE is a mining company in my own area. Five generations of my family have worked at this mine—since the 1900s, in fact. It is a company that understands the challenges of the future. It is a company that is up to the challenges of the future. It reflects the great strength of this nation that our companies and our communities are up to the challenges of the future and are up to taking the opportunities of the future. It is sad that those opposite persist in a view that is narrow and negative. I believe it is a view of our capacity as a nation that will not last the test of time. Now is the time for action. These amendments should be rejected and we should get on with leading the world as we have done so well, in so many areas, for so many generations. It is time that we act.

It is not limited to one demographic but is right across the board. There is particular anxiety and sadness in those demographics that have traditionally voted Labor, and those members opposite know that. They are not only defying the wishes and concerns of their constituents but also destroying the future opportunities and prosperity of their communities—and they know it. And for what? For the short-term political gain and the short-term political survival of the worst Prime Minister this country has ever seen.

Those opposite know it. We have seen the experience in Europe where carbon leakage has risen massively, where Europe has lost industries only to have them replaced by industries abroad that have increased carbon emissions.

He was trying to claim that China was moving ahead of us in leaps and bounds when the reality is that China is engaged in an extraordinary increase in emissions. China will replace coal-fired power stations with other coal-fired power stations, and it will increase emissions far more than Australia will. We have seen the

If you were not going to damage, with a sledgehammer, an industry as important as this you would not need to contemplate this very expensive use of taxpayers' funds to compensate it. But what about the vast majority of steelworkers who are not going to be covered? According to the most recent figures we have, there are about 91,000 employees across the entire Australian steel industry, and the Steel Transformation Plan will only cover those in BlueScope and

You cannot have a viable steelmaking industry in Australia without a viable steel fabrication industry. If there are no steel fabricators in Australia, there is no need for steel to be made in Australia—particularly since BlueScope has closed the door for the moment on its export market. So it is a fraud to say that the Steel Transformation Plan will save the steel industry, because there is no plan for when this money runs out. That is because it has not addressed the basic problem of competitiveness. It has not addressed the problem of what happens when this money runs out and when imports will effectively be given a leg up with this reverse tariff that we have on Australian industry and Australian manufacturing. As for the green jobs: what a joke, what a farce. Nowhere in the world have we seen jobs in industry destroyed and replaced with commensurate jobs in the green sector, and it will not happen here.

I am sure it is the same in non-rural and regional electorates and I am sure it is the same in Labor electorates as well. The people will have a say. They should have a say at the next election. I take this opportunity to seek leave to table signatures of more than 1,200 people in my electorate who have opposed a carbon tax and want to seek an election.

The Chief Government Whip has the call.

While I have not been here as long as the member for Mackellar, who has been very active in this debate, I have been here for some 15½ years and I have been a student of the parliamentary process for much longer than that. I have never seen such an extraordinary course of events. Never has such a wide-ranging and broad amendment been moved in the in-detail stages of a government bill. It is not that strange for an opposition with no new ideas and no alternative solutions to put forward such an amendment to defer the actions of the will of the House, but it is extraordinary that they should put forward such an amendment in the in-detail part of a debate, a period of the debate which is usually confined to the specifics of the very complex legislation before the House.
                                                                                                                                                                                               </p>

The other side ignored points of order from this side while they continued to read their speeches no matter what the deputy speakers ruled. What is even more extraordinary is that we all stand here in defence of democracy. People over the ages have given their lives for democracy. Indeed, Australian soldiers continue to give their lives in pursuit of giving others the opportunity to participate in parliamentary democracy.

Indeed, John Howard went to the 2007 election with a response to climate change not unlike the architecture of what we are putting through the House and what we have been debating in this place for a long time. When the Australian people pick up their newspapers tomorrow and come to understand the antics in this House tonight, the crescendo being the expulsion of the member for Indi, they will understand what this debate is really about.

I want to highlight some of the people who have not been able to have a say and really want to have a say. These are people from my electorate. Sallyann Pottinger from Shoal Point says if the carbon tax goes ahead she will never vote for Labor again. Mary Old from Mackay says the government does not have a mandate from the people for this. Dianne Worthington of Seaforth says she will never vote for Labor again if this tax goes through. Rob Geisler of Shoal Point, a Labor voter of 29 years, will not be voting for Labor again if the tax goes through.

The chair has already been taken on once tonight and we saw the result of that. The question before the chair is the consideration in detail about the amendment. The member for Dawson has plenty of opportunity to relate the remarks of his constituents to those amendments, but this is a debate that he could have had in the second reading. The member for Dawson has the call.

The government does not have a mandate. This amendment seeks to give the people a say by having an election before this tax is adopted. As someone who sat on the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation, I know that there is a groundswell of support for our proposition and against this carbon tax proposal by the government.

It is all of the submissions given to the carbon tax inquiry, but that were knocked back by the carbon tax inquiry. Some 4½ thousand people who sought to have their say were simply ruled as correspondents only. So the government have form on this in not giving people a say. Today they have two opportunities.

They have no mandate for this, absolutely none at all and I have plenty more submissions from people in my electorate who are outright opposed and say that this government does not have a mandate. They should have accepted the tabling of this document but they do not want to because they do not want people to have a say.

They currently do not have one and they must sit here very ashamed when they vote tomorrow, knowing deep in their hearts that the Prime Minister said that there will be no carbon tax under the government that she leads, the government which are now voting to accept this disgraceful tax against the wishes of the people.

As other members on this side have already said, the motive for delaying the introduction of this legislation is simply to ensure that the Australian people do not get to see it in operation because if they do then it will dispel much of the misinformation and the myths that have been created by members opposite when they speak about this legislation. It is absolutely in their interest to delay the introduction of the legislation because it enables them to continue to run the fear and the misinformation campaign which they have been running for the past 12 months and more.

I also speak to business people around the community. It is my view that they are equally concerned and for almost five years they have not known where they stand in respect of legislation relating to carbon emissions in this country. While that uncertainty hangs over their heads, they do not know whether they should plan particular investments, they do not know what direction they should take because they simply do not know where they stand in the future when it comes to legislation on this issue. It is time, after five years, that they did know because that will enable them to plan with certainty for the future.

He made the point that we should not be acting because firstly our emissions—he put them at one per cent, they are a little bit higher than that—are irrelevant to the global situation. He quoted a speech from a person whose name I do not recall who made the point that without America's and China's involvement there is no point in us doing anything.

It is not inconsequential, it is not insignificant; therefore the USA is contributing to the global response on this issue.

That is again not insignificant. Furthermore, China has pledged to lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40 to 45 per cent by the year 2020 compared to 2005 levels. That is quite an ambitious target. Finally, China has a number of provinces and cities including Guangdong and Hubei and the municipalities of Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing which are set to trial an emissions trading scheme in the year 2012. Those Chinese provinces represent a quarter of a billion people—that is the magnitude of the input just in that area alone.

I think it is totally wrong and improper to suggest that just because we produce one per cent it is insignificant in the global scheme of things. At the very minimum we should do our share to play our part in what is truly a global problem. Quite frankly, that is all this legislation ensures that we do—play our part as responsible global citizens in addressing a global problem.

I have to agree with the member for Makin inasmuch as we are trying to delay this vote. We are in fact trying to encourage the Prime Minister to show that she has at least some level of integrity in relation to maintaining a commitment that she made prior to this last election where she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We have seen what she has done, she has trashed the promise and we are in the situation that we find ourselves in tonight. I see the member for Dawson with the 4,500 submissions that have been rejected—4,500 rejections. There were only 73 submissions accepted. Those 4,500 were submissions that said, 'We do not agree with the government and we do want the opportunity of being able to express a point of view and have a vote.' I actually have a couple of those submissions from my constituents, who raise some serious concerns and disappointments. One of them that I have here is from Sally Bain from Bayview Heights in my electorate. In her single page submission she talks about things such as the tax weakening the Australian economy, that the tax will not make even a half of one per cent difference to the international carbon dioxide level and that it would be far better for the environment for the government to concentrate efforts and finances in other areas, such as reduction of use of plastics—particularly bottles and bags—and, of course, financing cheap and regular public transport. And so she goes on—it is quite a thoughtful submission.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       I have another one here from Bernie Treston, a solicitor in my area and clearly somebody who has put a lot of thought into his submission. Again, he expresses concerns about the mass of paperwork and employment of many public servants to try to implement the proposed methods of limiting pollution when there are so many cheaper and more effective ways of achieving results. Of particular concern is that it is likely to increase the costs of production, mainly caused through increase in electricity charges. He fails to see how they can pass this on to their customers.

While the committee considers the views in correspondence, it does not publish correspondence on its webpage. This does not lessen the importance of your contribution, however only those documents that went to specific detail about the bills were published as submissions.' I have one of the submissions that was actually accepted by this committee, and it was by Rob Feith. This is his submission:

And Phil Hobbs from Tusa Dive in Cairns says that already the tourism industry has done it very difficult, and here we have a situation where we have the government now pushing this through and breaking a promise.

The fact that these 4,600 which rejected this government's submission that we ought to have a carbon tax were not accepted I think is unprecedented. In fact of all the submissions they could only find something like 73 that actually agreed with them, and they are the only ones that they were prepared to accept.

I can tell you now that there are many people on the other side who we will not see around in the 44th parliament. I can guarantee you that. There is outrage in my community of Leichhardt and many other areas—everywhere I go. They are absolutely disgusted by the antics of this. They certainly do not accept the proposition that has been put forward by this government. They totally reject it and they demand a vote.

Part of the defence is that in actual fact others are not moving on this issue and therefore we should not.

The rest of the world clearly is acting, and both our economy and environment are at risk through delay. Many countries—all the major emitters—are acting now to reduce carbon pollution, and a broad range of countries have introduced or are planning market-based emissions trading schemes and carbon taxes. It is worth noting that our top five trading partners—China, Japan, the

All this work is happening. China, which was referenced before in the debate, has ambitious targets to reduce its economy's energy and carbon intensity. By 2013 it is planning pilot emissions trading in several major provinces and cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. The combined population—this is worth noting—is over 200 million people, and the combined
                                                                                                                                                                                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

So it is obvious that the world is moving on this, and the danger for us is that we will be left behind as they move ahead and, as I indicated earlier in the debate, we will be forced to play expensive catch up. For every year we do not undertake any action we will be required to stump up $5 billion extra to help get us closer to the five per cent emission reduction target by 2020. I have noticed in this debate a reference to democracy, and I have noticed a reference to people not being given a say. I think that if we are going to talk about people having a say, there is one member of the entire opposition front bench of 21 MPs that has not spoken against the carbon price. He is the only member of the entire shadow ministry of 27 members, including all of the shadow parliamentary secretaries, who has not spoken. He is one of only five out of 72 coalition MPs not to speak against the carbon price and one of only three MPs of the 70 who have been present for the whole debate who have chosen not to speak. That person is the member for Wentworth. So if you are going to come in here and tell us that, bringing all of your petitions and all of your statements, and quoting people who have been denied a say, look at your own side, where there is clearly a division, particularly amongst senior people who believe that action does need to be taken and is not.

Let me share with you that, in a shocking and historically unprecedented suppression of political expression, 4,500 Australians opposed to the carbon tax have had their submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation rejected out of hand. Upon its establishment, the joint select committee called for submissions from Australians on the legislation to impose a carbon tax. Despite giving Australians only one week to wade through over 1,000 pages of legislation, the committee website specifically states that it encourages submissions to its inquiries from a wide range of individuals and organisations, yet only 73 submissions, mainly in favour of a carbon tax, were accepted by the committee, with 4,500 rejected out of hand. Never in the history of the Australian parliament has such a widescale rejection of opinions taken place. Never before have submissions been rejected in such a manner. This is hubris of the highest order.

The government is introducing the world's largest carbon tax legislation in parliament this week, and if the world's largest carbon tax becomes law it effectively means higher prices will also become law. It will be the law for higher fuel prices for 60,000 businesses. It will be the law for higher electricity prices for every Australian family and business. It will be the law for higher public transport costs. It will be the law that raises costs for Australian manufacturers.

It tends to emanate out of the south-eastern corner of this country. Significant costs will be derived from the cost of an increase in fuel and then transporting it across the country. When talking with truckies, they say to me that it costs them $3,000 minimum, and if they go further from Perth to Kununurra then the cost is again the same.

They find that the increasing costs are impacting on their quality of life and their choice of life for themselves and their children. Any other increases that are additional to what they experience at the moment will only be an added burden, and it will be a pity to see that the people who go without will be those in greatest need. Even those on Centrelink payments will have to bear the cost of the increases that will come. I am sure that there are many in this House who will never go hungry nor want for a comfortable bed, yet there will be others in my electorate and those of many others who will experience poverty and the challenges of meeting the costs of living. In that context, they will not be able to give their families and children the quality of life that they have always dreamed of and aspired to. Those seeking to own homes will have the additional burden of that tax. I feel for those who will have the greatest impact—
