         I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question because obviously the member for Deakin is far more interested in the security of Australia and the Australian people than some of those who have been

            <p>
             As I said a moment ago, September 11 tragically represented the loss of too many innocent lives at the hands of terrorists, and those events changed the security environment forever. This government is committed to the safety of Australia and Australians.
            </p>
            <p>
             The opposition would have us believe that a new department of homeland security would offer a magic answer to all security concerns. Unfortunately, administrative restructure would offer nothing in the way of new policy and ignores the excellent cooperative arrangements that underpin our security arrangements that are in place here in Australia today. As the Commissioner of the

             ,

             , acknowledged in a radio interview only yesterday, there exists a very high level of cooperation between relevant agencies here in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortunately for Australians, this government is committed to implementing practical measures to improve security. We have committed over $8.3 billion over 10 years, enhancing national security arrangements. We have increased the resourcing of our security agency
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

             —an increase in the order of a quarter of a million dollars in this financial year. We have identified critical infrastructure assets at greatest risk, and we have worked in partnership with the business community to protect those most vital assets.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our counter-terrorism exercise program is one of the most comprehensive in the world. It attracts observers from around the globe to Australia when those exercises occur. The national security hotline has proven to be a very considerable success, with over 83,000 calls since it commenced operation in 2002. Many of those calls have led to very fruitful lines of inquiries for appropriate agencies. On the legislative front, we have refined and adapted our laws in response to the experience and relevant developments we have seen abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the government cannot offer a guarantee that a terrorist act will not occur in Australia, we are clearly committed to protecting our citizens here and abroad. Our law enforcement and security agencies have the resources and the tools, and I am sure all members of this House would join me in recognising their professionalism at the front line in the fight against terrorism.
