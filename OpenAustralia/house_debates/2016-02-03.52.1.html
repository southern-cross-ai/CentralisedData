        My question is to the Prime Minister. The National Catholic Education Commission has warned that the government's $30 billion of cuts to schools will mean that 'fees will increase, schools could close and the quality of education will be compromised'. In light of this serious warning, why is the Prime Minister persisting with his cuts to schools, refusing to adopt Labor's '

          I thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question. I must say, I was somewhat surprised to see the release of a document the other day that purported to be an education policy, but I would say that this document was badly named, because it was not an education policy; it was a 'save Bill' policy. That is what this is about; it is all about a 'save Bill' policy. Labor's three-page thought bubble was just another unfunded, irresponsible policy on the run by the Labor Party to save the hide of the Leader of the Opposition.

          This government is investing record levels of funding in Australian schools—some $69.4 billion over the four years to 2018-19, an increase of over 27 per cent, including $5 billion of investment for students with a disability, a record investment—

                 Yes, we are focusing on those things that matter. We are focusing on the fact that it is important that local principals are able to make local decisions to benefit of local schools. Under our StudentsFirst policy, we are focusing on those elements that are going to improve educational outcome. Our funding is based on strong evidence, and we are committed to negotiating with the states and territories from 2018 onwards with regard to education outcomes, and we will also be negotiating with the non-government sector. Labor's plan is unfocused, it is unfunded and it simply has not been thought through—just more spending without understanding what works.

                 Labor really needs to go back to school regarding its three-page thought bubble. The document should really have been called 'Your child. Their debt'. Labor simply does not understand that future generations will be burdened by its irresponsible spending, with no regard for delivering outcomes.
