        Once again this year, it was a pleasure to host our stand at the Colac Show. It was a terrific success. One of the big talking points, particularly amongst dairy farmers, was our China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It will open up significant new opportunities. Tariffs of up to 20 per cent will be progressively eliminated. Tariffs on ice cream and infant formula, for instance, will go within four years. But, at the Colac Show, there was plenty of disgust all around at the dishonest campaign that was being run by Labor and the unions over ChAFTA. Even after Labor conceded that ChAFTA was good for jobs and our economic future, and joined with us to pass the enabling legislation in this place, the union movement continued with its dishonest and unethical campaign.
