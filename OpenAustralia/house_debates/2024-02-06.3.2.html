       <p>
        Earlier today, we received news that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         His Majesty
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles_III" rel="nofollow">
         King Charles III
        </a>
        has been diagnosed with cancer. A cancer diagnosis is never easy, not for the person and not for their families. Australians know that His Majesty has always reached out to us when our country has needed him. He has always shown kindness and empathy for those doing it tough. His Majesty spent a formative period of his life here studying, as a very young man, and Australia has always had a special place in his affections. He knows that the feeling is very much mutual. I wrote to His Majesty this morning to let him know that all Australians are thinking of him and his family at this difficult time, and I'm sure that I speak on behalf of the entire chamber when I do so. We wish him well for a speedy recovery and we very much look forward to him being able to take up our invitation to make his first visit to Australia as King.

         associate the Coalition with the Prime Minister's remarks on our monarch,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles_III" rel="nofollow">
          King Charles III
         </a>
         . Our hearts go out to him, to his family, to the British people and to all those across the Commonwealth who care so deeply about the royal family. The monarch, only one year into his reign, is now struggling with this and so I do associate the Coalition with your remarks, Prime Minister.
