       <p>
        I am pleased to inform members about how the Rudd Labor government are driving real transport solutions in the Moreton electorate. Within our first 100 days of government, we announced the preferred option for the Kessels Road and Mains Road intersection upgrade to deal with a major traffic headache on Brisbane’s southside. The upgrade will involve the construction of an underpass to take Kessels Road traffic under Mains Road. Kessels Road traffic will travel along a more free-flowing road, which will vastly reduce air and noise pollution for local residents as this road carries the greater number of heavy commercial vehicles. This should result in a decrease in diesel particulate matter especially. An average of 70,000 vehicles are already using the intersection each day, including more than 5,000 trucks and buses doing local business.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that cabinet has approved $300 million towards construction of the project, but I also recognise that, unfortunately, there will be some impact on local residents and businesses. Nevertheless, from day one the local community has been fully involved in this Rudd government project, and the federal and Queensland governments will continue to engage with the community through a detailed consultation process. The feedback will help shape a business case for the project. Separating the two roads with an underpass will ease access into suburbs straightaway and will cater for the expected growth on Brisbane’s great southside for at least the next 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also pleased to inform the House that construction is progressing well on the $113 million

        rail overpass on Beaudesert Road. The 18-month project will see a 1.4-kilometre section of the interstate standard-gauge freight rail corridor lowered about 10 metres and two three-lane road vehicle bridges constructed. For years, southside residents have had to put up with long traffic delays at this rail crossing. Thankfully, when the overpass is completed, motorists will no longer face delays of up to 15 minutes—me included—while kilometre-long interstate freight trains grind slowly through the crossing at sloth-like speeds. It will also boost safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians to get around the Acacia Ridge area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Work is also underway to construct sound barriers on Riawena Road—an important link in the Brisbane urban corridor. The need for noise barriers on Riawena Road was first identified in the Brisbane Urban Corridor Planning Study, which was undertaken way back in 2002. Since my election in November, I have been working hard with the state member for Yeerongpilly Simon Finn to ensure this important work is completed as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I am pleased to see progress on these fronts, I am conscious that this speech should have been made 10, 11 or 12 years ago. Instead, the people of Moreton have waited and waited and waited. They grew tired of the ‘all talk and no action’ agenda of the previous government. There is still much to be done and that is why we, together with all levels of government, are getting on with the job of improving transport infrastructure in Moreton.
