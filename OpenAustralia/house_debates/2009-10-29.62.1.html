        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his refusal in question time today to say whether the national security adviser is reporting directly to him, whether the

        security clearance expires tomorrow and what arrangements are being made to extend it, whether the government proposes to make cash payments to the passengers on the
        <i>
         Oceanic Viking
        </i>
        in order to induce them to leave the vessel, and what arrangements are in place to ensure that the vessel is adequately and safely supplied. Will the Prime Minister now finally take the opportunity to answer these straightforward, factual questions?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question on those matters which he has just referred to. Taking them in reverse order, the first was about supplies to the vessel. Yes, the vessel will be supplied. That is why we have arrangements already with Australian authorities, in cooperation with the Indonesians, to provide the necessary victualling and other supports for the vessel in question. Secondly, on the question of payments, because they currently have no status under Australian immigration law they are not receiving payments. Mr Speaker, the question was asked about payments to those on the vesselâ€”

            <p>
             The Leader of the Opposition is so desperate to get on with his censure motion that he now seeks to add to the questions he has just asked. The question he asked just now was: would I answer the question about cash payments to those on the vessel, and what I have said to those opposite is that they have no status under Australian immigration law and therefore they are not entitled to any payments. Secondly, if that status changes under Australian immigration law at any time in the future, consistent with Australian government practice in the past, they would be entitled to a range of supports, as the Howard government provided. But that is entirely determined on the basis of what happens with the future determination of their status.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thirdly, in respect of any support which is given to them in terms of sustenance by organisations like the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
              UNHCR
             </a>
             or
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOM" rel="nofollow">
              IOM
             </a>
             and international governments around the world who support those organisations, of course those arrangements would proceed as normal, as they have in all other circumstances. That is the second question, which the honourable member suggests that I have not answered directly.

                Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is always in search of how you whip it up into a censure motion. The agenda of course is to save his leadershipâ€”and it is Thursday, and it is not about the policy in question. Let me go to the third one which he asked, which was about the
                <i>

                </i>
                â€™s diplomatic clearance being extended. My advice is that the normal extension of diplomatic clearances for vessels is a routine matter between governments and, given what the Indonesian foreign minister said last night, we have no advice before the government which suggests any difficulty with the continued extension of the diplomatic clearance which extends to the vessel at present. That is the third one that he raised. And what was the first one, which is now the fourth?

                    also provided advice on security matters to my predecessor, Mr Howard, when he was Prime Minister.
