        Last Friday evening I joined Moreton residents and others in Multicultural Australia's LUMINOUS Lantern Parade at Southbank. I was joined by my colleague the member for Blair as well as the state member for Cooper, Jonty Bush, who was representing the

        and other politicians, and community leaders. A big congratulations to Multicultural Australia on the 16th successful year of

        . It is one of this nation's most significant welcome events. This parade uses light to symbolise hope and create a welcoming atmosphere for new Queenslanders. The LUMINOUS Lantern Parade has become an iconic annual event in our local calendar. It is a wonderful example of the aspects that make our multicultural community and multicultural nation unique in including the diversity of culture, heritage, people, places and industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parade showcases a magnificent display of lanterns creatively designed and illuminated to create a spectacular visual experience. The use of light as a symbol of hope reflects the spirit of inclusiveness and extends a warm welcome to those who are new to Queensland. The lantern parade also provides an opportunity for the entire community to come together and celebrate the rich cultural diversity within our state while embracing those who are joining the community fresh. Originally the parade was made up of a small group of refugee advocates and Friends of Multicultural Australia, then known as the Multicultural Development Association. All up, there were probably only 30 or so people at that very first gathering, each holding a burning candle in a cup. But, on the Friday evening just gone, there were more than 100 groups walking in the parade, about 2,000 people marching and nearly 10,000 people watching. People were carrying elaborate lanterns of all shapes and sizes but with a unified message of welcome to newly arrived Queenslanders. Morton-connected organisations such as the Muslim Charitable Foundation; Milpera State High School, which does great job of welcoming new students before they are mainstreamed; Yeronga State High School, the Federation of Indian Communities Queensland and the Queensland African Communities Council are long-term participants, and that is just naming a few.

        It was also inspiring to meet

        from the Yes campaign and to hear local multicultural groups loudly pledging their support for the Voice to Parliamentâ€”the newest joining with the oldest. They join a growing nationwide alliance of multicultural groups who have stepped up for a yes vote. Multicultural communities feel strongly about reconciliation. Many come from countries where they have experienced exclusion and disadvantage. Australia offers migrants a great opportunity and they see the referendum as an opportunity to give back to

        people, to thank them for their generous offer to walk alongside. The LUMINOUS Lantern Parade is only possible because of the support of dedicated staff of Multicultural Australia.
