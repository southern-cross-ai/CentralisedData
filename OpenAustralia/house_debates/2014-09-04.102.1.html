        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to Australia's continued draw-down of operations in Afghanistan and the return home of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel. Will the minister inform the House of the action that the government is taking to support the rehabilitation of those personnel who have been wounded whilst on active service?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Bass for his question and for his notable military service, including combat operations in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . Defence Force has now been involved in continuous operations since 1999. The decision to employ combat forces overseas is, for any government, a grave responsibility that this House well appreciates. It is also a responsibility that both sides have taken seriously in supporting the rehabilitation of our wounded warriors when they return home.
        </p>
        <p>
         Much has been done in recent years by governments of both persuasions to assist those of our personnel who have returned from service. Notably the Support to Wounded, Injured or Ill Program put forward by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of Army
         </a>
         is a fantastic initiative that seeks to continuously support the services we provide to our wounded and to increase and improve the rehabilitation services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our Soldier Recovery Centres at each of our major combat brigade locations have been assisting in the management of complex cases and are seeing some really fine results; and, of course, the transition centres have been running with a focus on those returning to civilian life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, as a continued part of the campaign to assist our wounded, ill and injured diggers, an Australian team will depart Australia today to participate in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Invictus Games
         </a>
         . This is an international adaptive, multi-sport competition. It will be held in London from 10 to 14 September for current and former military personnel who have been wounded or injured or have become ill serving their country. Championed by His Royal Highness Prince Harry, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          Captain Wales
         </a>
         , the games promote the role that can be played in physical and psychological rehabilitation. It is about inspiring our wounded, our injured and our ill and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thirty-six Australians will go, and they will join 400 other wounded, injured or ill soldiers from around the world. The government, enjoying the support of the opposition, wholeheartedly support this great objective, and we believe the games will inspire and support the rehabilitation of our current wounded warriors. Participants from 14 nations will all join in, including soldiers from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">

         , Canada, Germany, France, the

         and Afghanistan. Four hundred athletes will compete in a range of adaptive, multisport competitions: athletics, archery, indoor rowing, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is incredibly proud that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         has decided to join and sponsor part of the team of 36 and are putting forward some third of a million dollars to assist. I thank the RSL, on behalf of the parliament, for it. Each competitor will be accompanied by a family member to highlight the important roles that family and support networks play.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a privilege to launch the team last week, and I am sure I speak for the House when I wish all of our wounded warriors good success but, more importantly, good rehabilitation in the games and beyond.
