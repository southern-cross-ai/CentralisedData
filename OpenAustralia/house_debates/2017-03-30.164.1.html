        I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding local event that celebrates the best of the

        lifestyle with fresh produce, innovative gourmet foods, local and craft wineries, distillers and breweries. Toast the Coast is a fantastic initiative of Gosford Rotary Club. It is now in its second year and will take place this Saturday 1 April from 11 am. The festival is held at the entertainment grounds in Gosford and has become an outstanding celebration of our region's exceptional wine, food, produce and entertainment. With almost 100 specialty food, wine and craft beer vendors taking part, this year's event is set to build on last year's success, with organisers expecting more than 12,000 people this Saturday. There is really something for everybody. There is live music day, there is a kids entertainment zone and, for those who might need a little quiet time, there is even an adult's chill-out zone.
       </p>
       <p>
        For just a gold coin donation, festival goers will be treated to live entertainment, gourmet food stalls, local wines, microbreweries, street food, locally made cheese, fresh local produce and cooking demonstrations from our very own

        . As the ambassador for this year's event Julie has been singing the praises of our exceptional local businesses, farmers, chefs and entertainers. Julie said that Toast the Coast is a chance to celebrate all of the good things that we have here on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event is all about celebrating what we do well, but it also raises money for an outstanding cause, Coast Shelter's vital domestic violence prevention programs. This is an issue that I am personally very concerned about. It is also something that this government is backing with initiatives such as our $100 million women's safety package and $100 million to fund the Third Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Last year's event, which I attended, was just outstanding. It raised more than $20,000 for Coast Shelter. But I am pleased to report that Toast the Coast is expected to raise an impressive $60,000 this year to help people dealing with homelessness on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also fantastic to see local businesses get on board to support Toast the Coastâ€”businesses like Worthington

I would also like to pay tribute to each and every business, organisation and individual who has supported this year's event. It is their support that has allowed this event to grow and continue to grow with the goal of becoming one of the biggest food and wine festivals in

        I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about another great business on the Central Coast, Eastcoast Foods &amp; Beverages. They have been going from strength to strength over the past year. They have secured a contract to supply Woolworths and have added their juices to menus at local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
         McDonald's
        </a>
        restaurants. Now, I am pleased to learn, they have set their sights overseas. Eastcoast has been actively pursuing export opportunities into China, which will see our much-loved Central Coast business enter one of the world's biggest and fastest-growing markets. I am advised by owners Sam and Samuel Lentini that Eastcoast is currently pitching to export up to 100,000 of its water bottles per day, which will see them take on even more employees in Kulnura. I am advised that already the increasing demand for their water has seen six more jobs added to their Central Coast factory.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is growing demand across Asia for Australia's world-class produce, and I am so pleased that, as a result of the landmark China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, we will see more jobs and we will strengthen our economy, which will lead to and create a better future for everyone. The government has worked hard to ensure this high-quality agreement reduces tariffs and opens up opportunities for our local businesses by securing markets and providing improved access to China, so I certainly encourage local businesses, large and small, to make the most of our enhanced competitive position in the Chinese market and to learn more about how they can capitalise not only on this agreement but also those we have secured with Korea and Japan. I look forward to Toast the Coast this weekend and invite everyone from the Central Coast and beyond to join us.
