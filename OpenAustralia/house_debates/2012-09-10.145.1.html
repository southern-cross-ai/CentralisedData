       <p>
        Last Friday I attended the funeral service of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McKechnie" rel="nofollow">
         Robert McKechnie
        </a>
        , or 'Bob' as he was affectionately known in our community. Bob was one of the Territory's last surviving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
         Korean War
        </a>
        veterans. He sadly passed away on 1 September. On Friday, Bob was remembered for his ability to tell a good story as well as for his commitment to community service. I was fortunate enough to have known Bob, and I feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to spend some time with him and to listen to some of his many stories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob's health was not too good in the last year or so of his life. Sadly he spent quite a bit of his time coming to blows with the federal bureaucracies that we all know. Bob had asked me for my assistance to help him obtain a stair lift for his home because he was having enormous trouble navigating the steep stairs of his two-storey home. This came after the chemotherapy and operations he had had.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob had written to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans Affairs
        </a>
        requesting funding to get assistance for the lift, but unfortunately he was knocked back. We believed that he was eligible under the Veterans' Entitlements Act for this piece of equipment. I am pleased to say that despite their knock-back of his application, after my involvement the department reconsidered—after I spoke with the minister's office—and Bob was able to get the stair lift. He got that in March, and I will never forget the look on his face when he had the first ride on this stair lift in his house. He told me it made such a big difference to him and his wife because he was able to move freely around and was not confined.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was a highly respected man who will be sadly missed by us all. He was also heavily involved in rugby league, and was the passionate president of the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated associations, or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
         TPI
        </a>
        s. At his funeral they said that they broke the mould after Bob, and that is so true. He was a one-of-a-kind, a true gentleman, and we will never forget him. My condolences to Dorothy, his wife, his family, his friends, the veteran community and his TPI mates. Rest in peace, Bob: you will never be forgotten. Thank you on behalf of a grateful nation. We honour you and your services to our country.
