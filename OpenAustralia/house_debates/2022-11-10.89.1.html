        All Australians deserve to feel safe and secure in their communities. Unfortunately, Labor scrapped the $50 million in the budget for the Safer Communities Fund. This was to help high-risk infrastructure, especially places of worship. Labor members do not understand the benefits of the Safer Community Fund, because they simply don't care about these vulnerable communities.

         Maybe the Labor members should listen to this. For example, the invisible member for Lalor didn't visit a Hindu temple in Tarneit when it was firebombed, gas-bombed, vandalised or robbed, or when a vehicle was actually driven into the temple. After all the attacks, still the member for Lalor didn't bother to support them in their fight. The member's office is only 11 kilometres away from the temple, yet she was nowhere to be seen, to help.
        </p>
        <p>
         My office was 75 kilometres away, yet I've been there three times. The coalition stands up for and supports multicultural communities in Labor-held seats when the lazy Labor members can't be bothered. This member's in a safe seat. Maybe the Labor Party needs to find a more active member—or, better still, an active Liberal member.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everyone has the right to feel safe and to practice their faith in a safe and secure environment. It's time for Labor and the Treasurer to immediately restore that funding. It's a disgraceful decision. You should be ashamed of yourselves!
