           <p>
            I refer to an article on 10 August in a page 1 splash in the
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
              Daily Telegraph
             </a>
            </i>
            headlined 'Albo's Air Farce: Minister accused of helping MPs break curfew'. It was alleged by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
             Sydney Airport
            </a>
            chief Max Moore-Wilton that my office 'allowed 10 flights after the curfew between 11 pm and 11.30 pm the other night' and he is reported as saying, 'I suspect there were a few politicians on these planes.'
           </p>
           <p>
            The facts are these. Mr Moore-Wilton would know full well that decisions about the curfew's operation are made by the delegate of the secretary of my former department. Neither I nor my office made decisions on curfew dispensations on that evening. Further, there were no planes which took off or landed after the curfew. Further again, there were no politicians on those non-existent planes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I seek to make a further explanation. I can do them all in a job lot if you like, in order of the
            <i>

             <p>
              On the same day in an article headlined on page 3, 'Green light to break curfew', Mr Moore-Wilton alleged that I had written to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways" rel="nofollow">
               Qatar Airways
              </a>
              advising them not to fly to Sydney. The fact is this. Qatar is permitted right now to fly to Sydney seven times a week. Instead they choose to fly seven times a week to Melbourne and seven times a week to Perth, a fact that was relayed to the
              <i>
               Daily
              </i>
              <i>
               Telegraph
              </i>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              I have been further misrepresented in the same article. Mr Moore-Wilton is quoted as saying:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Really he is the minister for no noise over Marrickville. He will never spend a dollar on
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
               Sydney Airport
              </a>
              because the No Aircraft Noise Party and the Greens will tear him limb from limb.
             </p>
             <p>
              The facts are these. Sydney Airport is a privately run airport that has made substantial returns. I note it is yet to pay a single dollar in tax since it was privatised.
             </p>
             <p>
              Further, on 19 August in a front-page splash, 'Albanese blows billions on airport curfew',
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lyman" rel="nofollow">
               John Lyman
              </a>
              claimed:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The Deputy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's restrictive management of the Sydney Airport curfew has cost Australia $3.5 billion in lost tourism and nearly 8,000 jobs.
             </p>
             <p>
              The facts, which were also conveyed to the
              <i>
               Daily
              </i>
              <i>
               Telegraph
              </i>
              at the time, are these. The curfew was introduced after a private member's bill from the then member for Bennelong,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
               John Howard
              </a>
              . As minister, I made no changes to the act or the operation of the curfew. Between 5 am and 6 am the act did allow for limited exemptions for arrivals at Sydney Airport—ironically because of curfews which operate at both Heathrow and Frankfurt airports. By extension of the methods Sydney Airport used—that 11 flights a week deliver almost 8,000 jobs—this logic suggests that Sydney Airport itself is responsible for 4,195,800 jobs.

                Further, on 19 August, in an article by

                 John Lyman
                </a>
                on page 4 of the

                 Daily
                </i>
                <i>
                 Telegraph
                </i>
                headlined, 'Wimpish personal politics put ahead of the national interest', Mr Lyman argued that I had let my 'fear of aircraft blind him'—meaning me—'to the enormous economic benefits in job opportunities he is denying the people of Sydney'. The fact is this. The regulation limiting flights arriving in Sydney between 5 am and 6 am each week to 24 has not been changed by any minister, including me, since it was introduced in 1995. During my time as minister I received no applications for flights outside curfew from curfew constrained destinations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Further, on 21 August in an article in the

                </i>
                <i>
                 Telegraph
                </i>
                headed 'Too few flights cater for Chinese', John Lyman accused me of undermining the Chinese tourism boom by failing to strike a deal to allow more flights in. The facts are these. Right now, more than 5,500 unused weekly sites are available to Chinese carriers flying to major Australian airports and further seats are available for flights to airports other than the gateway airports. As minister, I in fact signed off on agreements which tripled capacity with China. The last agreements were signed just last year and we announced new flights to Cairns with

The work I commissioned on projects such as the second Sydney airport was essential prior work that now facilitates early decisions on the merit of these projects.

                          Madam Speaker, on a point of order: the member needs to show where they were personally misrepresented and correct the misrepresentation. It is not an opportunity for argument. The member for Grayndler showed her how to do it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has failed to do it successfully. I would therefore put it to you that she has abused the opportunity to correct the misrepresentation.

                           To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I would say that the member for Grayndler did show how it is done correctly. The deputy leader is not doing it properly. She is indulging in argument. Perhaps the member can show precisely where she has been misrepresented, with a statement and a response.

                            I do not have the health minister's response in writing, but my recollection of his wording was that there was the suggestion that chemotherapy services were disrupted under my watch as health minister. That is completely untrue. New medicines were listed on the PBS for 17 different cancers.

                                  the Treasurer attempted to draft me as a supporter of his $200 billion increase in the debt cap, quoting my words from May 2012. In those statements I was referring to a $50 billion increase, one that had been justified weeks earlier in the 2012 budget. I have been misrepresented, because this increase is four times larger and no justification for it has been provided. The Treasurer cannot conscript me into his service.
