        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer the minister to the investigation by the Office of Workplace Services into the offering of Australian workplace agreements to approximately 150 casual employees of the chocolate company

           I thank the member for Stirling for the question. I note that, in 1996, the unemployment rate in Stirling was 9.4 per cent, and today it is 5.2 per cent. Good news there, Mr Speaker! The economic reforms of past years have helped to deliver a strong economy today, and today’s reforms help to deliver a strong economy for tomorrow. All the reforms undertaken by this government—such as getting the budget back into surplus, paying off $96 billion of Labor government debt, taxation reform, reform of the waterfront—have been opposed by the Labor Party. More recently, the Labor Party has opposed the

              Future Fund
             </a>
             , as the Treasurer reminds me. All of those initiatives, including the changes to workplace relations, have helped to deliver a stronger economy. One of the most significant groups which has benefited from the changes to workplace relations has been women. Since March 2006, when
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
              Work Choices
             </a>
             was introduced, employment for women has risen by 113,500 jobs. Most significantly, 87 per cent of those 113,500 jobs have been full-time jobs. Since March 1996, the participation rate of women in the workforce has increased from 53.7 per cent to 57.6 per cent. The wages of women in the workforce have increased in real terms by more than 22 per cent. That is pretty positive stuff.

             Everyone is wondering what the Labor Party’s policy is on workplace relations. You should not have to go too far because the chief spokesman for the Labor Party,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">
              Greg Combet
             </a>
             , and his deputy,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharan_Burrow" rel="nofollow">
              Sharan Burrow
             </a>
             , are out there every day defending the Labor Party’s workplace relations policy, which is to reintroduce pattern bargaining, reintroduce the unfair dismissal laws, centralise the industrial relations system and so on. We have heard a bit of speculation recently that the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to manufacture a ‘Blair moment’ at the national conference—that is, to set up a straw man and then knock him over. He is going to pretend that he is being tough on the unions. I wondered to myself, ‘What is a Blair moment?’ I went back to what I think is a pretty impressive speech from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair" rel="nofollow">
              Tony Blair
             </a>
             at the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress" rel="nofollow">
              Trades Union Congress
             </a>
             , Brighton, on 9 September 1997. That was 10 years ago. In that speech Tony Blair commits to reduce tax—of course, the Labor Party oppose that. He commits to welfare to work—and the Labor Party in Australia oppose that. He said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             We will keep the flexibility of the present—
            </p>

             market. And it may make some shiver, but ... in the end it is warmer in the real world.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is saying that he is going to keep the reforms of the Tory government, the Thatcher government, and continue them because they are in the best interests of the workers of Britain. If that is a Blair moment, we cannot expect that from Kevin. The Leader of the Opposition speculated on what ‘a Kevin’ is. We know what a Kevin is: it is Sharan Burrow putting a half-nelson on the Leader of the Opposition. That is a Kevin. He is going to pretend that it is him putting a half-nelson on Sharan Burrow.

                            to trade away penalty rates, why isn’t it okay for individuals to negotiate their own employment outcome? The Labor Party does not like that. The Labor Party never likes to take into account the interests of the workers because it is just a party for the union bosses.

                              I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and for her very passionate support for small businesses. Over the past 12 months, small businesses have been speaking out very strongly in support of the Howard government exempting them from Labor’s unfair dismissal laws. Since becoming the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Griffith has said that Labor would listen to small business on this very important issue of unfair dismissals. In fact, when asked on ABC radio on 28 March about the Labor Party’s policy on unfair dismissals, the Leader of the Opposition said in no uncertain terms:
                             </p>

                              Earlier, on Channel 10, the deputy leader said:

                              I’m prepared to talk to small business on the substance of their concerns and see what we can do to address those concerns. That’s a genuine offer, it’s a serious offer.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Then, of course, we had the member for Rankin—who unfortunately appears to have gone missing in action—in a memorable interview with Madonna King on 28 February. He said:
                             </p>
                             <p class="italic">
                              … we will take account of the special circumstances of small businesses in developing our policies and we have not arrived at a position on how we will do that in terms of a precise policy because that will be released after we consult …

                              Small business today has spoken out very strongly with one voice. It is now time for the Labor Party to demonstrate whether in fact they have been listening. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that after listening to the member for Rankin, the

                              reform for small business was the introduction of the exemption for small and medium businesses from unfair dismissal claims.

That might come as a rude surprise to some, but I have been misled by her on a few facts previously. I know that is hard to believe, but it is quite true. I will tell you what: there is nothing family friendly about 11 per cent unemployment. There is nothing family friendly about real wages decreasing as they did under the Labor Party. I have been sitting there wondering what the motivation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be on this last sitting day before Easter to ask this question. I reflected on the fact that it was

                                       The member for Fowler is warned! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition sought leave to table the document. Leave was given. She was asked to resume her seat. If she continues to disobey, I will deal with her.
