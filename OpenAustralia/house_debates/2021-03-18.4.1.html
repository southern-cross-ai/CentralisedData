        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour
        </a>
        Federation Trust was established in 2001 by the Howard government, as a transitional body to rehabilitate prominent former Defence sites on Sydney Harbour and open them up to public access and for the benefit of current and future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that time quite a bit has changed for the trust. Its portfolio has grown, its life has been extended and it has successfully opened h up all of its sites to the public, with only some small areas still closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The trust is now increasingly focused on the day-to-day management of the sites and the longer-term planning and actions to protect, preserve and enhance the sites consistent with the requirements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Federation_Trust" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour Federation Trust
        </a>
        Act 2001.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognising this, in 2019 the government announced an independent review into the trust's future arrangements to ensure that the right arrangements are in place for the important sites the trust manages.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report of the review was published in June 2020, and it made 21 recommendations, finding widespread support for the work of the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government agreed immediately with the central finding of the review that the trust should become an ongoing entity, retaining responsibility for the sites, rather than handing them over to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government and local councils for ongoing management.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2020-21 budget provided $40.6 million in funding over four years for the trust to support its work in rehabilitating its sites and providing valued community spaces, facilities and attractions. This is in addition to the $9 million made available to the trust on release of the review report, to keep its sites safe and accessible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2021 is the next major step in the implementation. As with the review, the bill has been framed in consultation with key stakeholders and the wider public.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill takes forward four of the review recommendations as well and other amendments to improve the operation of the act and to better equip the trust for its new ongoing role.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill implements the central finding of the review—that the trust becomes an ongoing entity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The trust was originally set up with a mission to remediate the sites and hand them over to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        and relevant local councils for ongoing management.
       </p>
       <p>
        The independent review affirmed the community's strong support for these important sites to remain in federal government hands, managed by the trust on an ongoing basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government agrees with this proposition, and so the bill will ensure the sites remain in the hands of the trust into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill supports the review's recommendation for a refresh of the trust's membership requirements to ensure it is equipped with the skills and expertise needed for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also updates provisions regulating the trust's commercial activities. The primary purpose of trust sites is to remain open for public access and amenity. But the last 20 years of operations has shown that sensitive commercial activities have a role to play in bringing life and amenity to the sites and contributing to the costs of protecting them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill maintains and strengthens key protections by ensuring long-term leases are only available where it is clearly consistent with the objectives of public access and amenity, and the conservation of heritage and environmental values. As part of this, the community will get a direct say in any such proposals.
       </p>
       <p>
        To continue to support the trust in its new ongoing role, the bill also modernises the language of the act and includes amendments related to a review of regulations under the act which are due to sunset and anticipated to be remade later this year, following community consultation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to thank the hard work of the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        , the member for Wentworth and Senator Bragg. The tireless advocacy of these three local representatives is reflected not just in this bill, but also in the recent budget and in the establishment of the review itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of my first visits to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust was to Sub Base Platypus with the member for North Sydney. I was incredibly impressed with how this former base for Australian Submarine Squadron has been opened to the public and it is a credit to the member for North Sydney who fought hard to bring this site to life, and I encourage all to jump on a ferry from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Quay" rel="nofollow">
         Circular Quay
        </a>
        to North Sydney to explore this wonderful spot on Sydney Harbour—one of many.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want acknowledge the Headland Preservation Group for their positive and constructive engagement with government in this process and for the support they have given to this bill, and to Joseph Carrozzi for his exemplary chairmanship of the trust through this period of transition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, the bill supports the recommendations of the independent review, and the government's commitment to ensure it has the right arrangements in place to protect the special sites managed by the trust into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
