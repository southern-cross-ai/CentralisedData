        A few moments ago the Prime Minister sacked five departmental heads. He sacked Daryl Quinlivan, a fine public servant from the department of agriculture and water resources. He sacked Kerri Hartland, formerly of

        </a>
        and most recently the head of employment and skills. He sacked Renee Leon, human services department, who won a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        a few years ago for outstanding public service to public administration and law. He sacked Mike Mrdak from the department of communications, who won an Order of Australia in 2016 for distinguished service to public administration through executive roles in infrastructure, transport and logistics. He sacked Heather Smith, a Public Service Medal winner in 2015 who won that medal for outstanding service during the G20, from the department of industry. On 1 February these fine Australian public servants, most of whom have served both sides of politics, are going to be out of a job. As they leave the building, the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction is still going to have his job. So, the question Australians are asking is: why are these fine public servants, who have been doing an excellent job serving the Australian community, losing their jobs while the most hopeless, the most pathetic, minister on the front bench has still got his job? It's a disgrace.
