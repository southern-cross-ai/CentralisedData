        on indulgenceâ€”We mourn the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Roach" rel="nofollow">
         Archie Roach
        </a>
        . Our country has lost a brilliant talent, a powerful and prolific national truth teller. Archie's music drew from a well of trauma and pain, but it flowed with beauty and a resonance that moved us all. We will always have his voice.
       </p>
       <p>
        As he sang Archie gave Australia a priceless gift, with songs informed by his own experiences as a member of the stolen generations. He brought us face to face with the truth. His music spanned the breath of the human experience. He was an elder, a storyteller. He was a source of wisdom, compassion, encouragement, generosity and forgiveness.
       </p>
       <p>
        The circumstances of Archie's life may have been tough but they never ever hardened his indominable spirit, and above all of that it shone through to us in the music. He sang to us with love and patience, but he also sang with a humility that was as powerful as his talent. Indeed, he never asked anything of us, just to open our ears. And yet he opened his heart to us, his strong but tender heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        His voice arrived like a warm embrace, and in the process he made the universe feel just that much bigger. Archie took us to some beautiful places, but the path he took us on to get that beauty could sometimes be a rugged one. He did not shy away from either pain or sadness, but neither did he from love. As Archie put it: empathy was his impetus.
       </p>
       <p>
        His talent was recognised with plenty of awards along the way and an induction into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIA" rel="nofollow">
         ARIA
        </a>
        Hall of Fame, but it is hard to escape the feeling he prides nothing more than being able to share his music with us.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met him on a few occasions at various music events, and he was as humble in person as you would expect him to be when you listen to that extraordinary voice and when you read or listen to the extraordinary words that he wrote.
       </p>
       <p>
        May his family draw consolation from the thought that maybe Archie now just walks in another place alongside his beloved Ruby once more. While we grieve Archie's death, we will try to heed his words: 'We won't cry. Oh, we will lift our spirits high, up to the sky.' We will hold onto everything that Archie Roach gave us. We will celebrate him and all that he created. What a remarkable man. What a privilege that our lives overlapped with his. May he rest in peace.

         I join with the Prime Minister in honouring the life of Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Roach" rel="nofollow">
          Archie Roach
         </a>
         AM. Forcibly removed from his family at the age of two, raised in foster homes, learning of the death of his biological mother and father via letter, living rough on the streets battling alcoholism and doing prison time, Archie Roach had every right to be resentful and vindictive, given the hardships of his early life. Yet, in his autobiography he wrote: 'People ask me if I ever get sick of singing my song "Took the Children Away." I tell them it is my healing song. Through songs I have been able to deal with the pain and trauma in a positive way.' Through music Archie was able to forgive and to heal. Indeed, 'Took the Children Away' did the same for many of the stolen generations and it helped the nation to come to terms with the actions of his forebears. Archie wrote: 'I believe in redemption and I believe in forgiveness, both important aspects of love, because I've experienced both.'
        </p>
        <p>
         It was the love of his foster family, the Cox's, which inspired his love of music. And, if music helped Archie to forgive then it was
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Hunter" rel="nofollow">
          Ruby Hunter
         </a>
         who brought about his redemption. Both children of the stolen generations and sharing a love for music their partnership was the catalyst of change in fortune. Archie found his voice and audience in music. He found his rhythm and calling in life. A life which would take him from opening for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Kelly
         </a>
         and the Messengers in 1989 to releasing a career spanning anthology in March this year; a life which would see his talent recognised as the recipient of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIA" rel="nofollow">
          ARIA
         </a>
         s, Deadly Awards and National Indigenous Music Awards; and a life which would see his service to our country acknowledged by his being made a member of the Order of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         It speaks volumes that a man who suffered and voiced the trauma of the stolen generations was able to write: 'Live a good life, be the best person you can be and always let love be your guide.' Australians will continue to be inspired by the lyrics and legacy of Archie Roach. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to all of Archie's colleagues and friends; and to the entire Roach family, especially Amos and Eban, Archie's sons, and Kriss, Arthur and Terrence, Archie's foster children. May he rest in peace.
