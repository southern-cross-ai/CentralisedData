        I rise to speak in memory of a truly great teacher and mentor, Mr John Sessarago. Sess, as he was lovingly known, was farewelled last week at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairholme_College" rel="nofollow">
         Fairholme College
        </a>
        , a school he had taught at for 36 years. John was born in Roma to Brian and Elizabeth and was brother to Gaby and Chrissy. He was also the very proud father of Jamee and Georgie and even prouder husband to Kristen.
       </p>
       <p>
        John was one of those teachers who didn't just believe in his students; he went out of his way to put that belief into them. One of these times is recalled very well by one of his more famous students,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Freeman" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In my time at Fairholme College, as a 14 and 15-year-old, a teacher named John Sessarago told me I could be an Olympian like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Griffith_Joyner" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis" rel="nofollow">
         Carl Lewis
        </a>
        … He gave me a photograph of myself high-jumping with his handwritten quote that read, 'It is our doubts of today that limit our realisations of tomorrow' … Sess, as he was affectionately known, grew my self-belief at a time when I was so unaware of what my future might bring, with his generosity and spirit and kindness of heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was the kind of thing that Sess did. There are countless other students who had similar interactions, and I'm so pleased to say that on the wall of my own home there is a photo of John with my own daughter, with an expression of his kindness, care and compassion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our community is much the worse for his passing. Rest in peace, John.
