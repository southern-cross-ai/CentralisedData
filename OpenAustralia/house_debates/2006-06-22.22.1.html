         ACT
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal will provide new and upgraded facilities for dog kennelling and training at Majura in the

         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        to enable the Australian Federal Police to meet increasing demand for canine services within Australia and overseas. They are such an important aspect of law enforcement and investigation today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed new canine kennelling and training facility is to be the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        centre for law enforcement canine training. At present, there is no state or territory with such a dedicated purpose-built canine training facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The facility will produce canine teams for the detection of firearms, explosives and drugs in the aviation environment and AFP national operations, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        coverage in 2007. It will also develop and build canine capability for the Australian Federal Police to support international deployment commitments, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposed training centre will provide capacity to produce 54 canine teams per year and provide maintenance and validation of operational teams. The facility will constantly house around 30 dogs throughout the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overall out-turn estimated cost of the works is $10.2 million.

        Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in November this year and be completed by November next year. I commend the motion to the House.

        On behalf of the Special Minister of State, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That, in accordance with the provisions of the
        <i>
         Public Works Committee Act 1969
        </i>
        , the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed fitout of new leased premises for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment_and_Workplace_Relations" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Employment and Workplace Relations
        </a>
        at Brindabella Park, ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations proposes to undertake a fit-out, at a cost of $15.5 million, of new leased premises at Brindabella Park in the ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed fit-out will provide the department with an additional 10,800 square metres of office accommodation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This degree of fit-out is required to accommodate the projected staffing numbers of the department to ensure the most efficient and effective use of the resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sharp increase in staffing numbers is largely the result of recent changes to workplace relations policy and the governmentâ€™s reforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fit-out will embrace the dynamic requirements of the department and form the basis for strategic realignment of working groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the fit-out procurement process could begin during September, allowing construction to commence by November this year. A staged construction has been adopted allowing stage 1 completion and occupation by December this year. Stage 2 would be completed by the end of January next year for occupation in early February. I commend the motion to the House.
