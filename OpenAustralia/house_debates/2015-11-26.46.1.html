       <p>
        Today I wish to pay tribute to a valued member of my electorate,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Robertson" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Robertson
        </a>
        , who was tragically killed in a road accident last Saturday. Jim was a grazier from Mundubbera in the North Burnett region. People who knew him well said he had a generous spirit and remember him as someone who always put others first. He could talk all day; he loved a chat. It was a tragedy that Jim was struck and killed by a car outside the South Kolan Hotel on the Bundaberg-Gin Gin Road. He was attending a fundraiser for Bundaberg police officer Senior Constable Dan Lukan at the timeâ€”Mr Lukan himself recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident earlier this month. Jim donated $1,000 to the fundraiser 15 minutes before his accident.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim was a passionate supporter of local causes, including regional facilities and fundraising events. He sat on the board of Gayndah's aged care facility, Gunther Village, for many years and he supported many fundraising events over the years. Jim and his wife made billy tea and damper at events across the region. Jim was 79 years old and lived a full life, but he was still taken from us too soon. My condolences to Jim's wife Jocelyn, son James, and other family members. It was a big loss to the community. Rest in peace, Jim.
