        18 August 2012 marked the 46th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        and, as many of us would know, 50 years since the first Australian troops arrived on Vietnam's soil in 1962. Commemorative ceremonies were held across our communities over the weekend. I know many in this House attended. The ceremonies gave us the opportunity to pause, to reflect and to bring to front of mind the sacrifices of Australians who served during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . On Saturday and Sunday I joined Vietnam veterans, their families, current serving personnel who call Hawkesbury and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        home and their families to honour their service and sacrifice in our nation's name.
       </p>

        The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam was sent to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">

        in July 1962 to train and support
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">

        troops. Over a decade, of the 60,000 Australians who served, 521 of our finest were killed in action and more than 3,000 were wounded in action. All who returned home did so changed forever.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to make special mention of the Mountains Vietnam Veterans and Associated Forces Incorporated for their outstanding contribution in planning and coordinating the Memorial Day Parade and service at Springwood. This is one of the largest services across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Western Sydney
        </a>
        and the Blue Mountains. It brings service organisations, veterans and those currently serving from all around our local communities. This year the special guest was Ms Sandra Lee, journalist and author of the book
        <i>
         Saving Private Sarbi: t
        </i>
        <i>
         he true story of Australiaâ€™s canine war hero
        </i>
        , as well as the explosive detection dog Sarbi and her handler. It was a privilege to also have a contingent of explosive detection dogs and their handlers leading the parade. This was an opportunity to acknowledge the valuable and dangerous role that these dedicated soldiers and their dogs play in operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year was an opportunity to acknowledge the role of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        , with two Vietnam-era Caribou aircraft doing a low-level flyover during the parade. These aircraft have been decommissioned from RAAF service and the flyover was courtesy of the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society.
       </p>
       <p>
        I honour all those who served in Vietnam and all those who worked towards making the weekend such a successful commemorative event.
