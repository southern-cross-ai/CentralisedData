        After many, many months of hoping for rain to help the farmers in my electorate, finally our prayers have been answered and the rain has come. But, as they say, when it rains it pours, and it's been pouring for quite some time now. There is seemingly no end in sight. I understand there was a fair bit of rain last night as well. For the most part, of course, rain is welcome. It helps support our primary producers in places like Elimbah, Moorina and Rocksberg and helps reduce the risk of bushfires in really susceptible areas like Ningi and Beachmere.
       </p>

        But sometimes having so much rain means that events that you were really and truly looking forward to are cancelled. It happened to me yesterday when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bribie Island
        </a>
        Emergency Services Expo was postponed because of the amount of rain we've had. This event takes place every year, and it's always a fantastic event. Thousands of people stop by to see everyone from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the police and the ambulance to the rural fire service come together and demonstrate what it is they do. This means plenty of demonstrations: anything from surf lifesaving to fire rescuers. It means plenty of fun for the whole family, who can get up close with fire trucks, army vehicles and other high-tech rescue equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as importantly, it means that we get an opportunity to thank personally the people who keep our communities safe, for the very important and often very dangerous work that they do. I'd like to make special mention of Graham Gibb and everyone from the Volunteer Marine Rescue organisation on Bribie Island, who host the expo every year, and every year outdo themselves. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMR" rel="nofollow">

        do some absolutely commendable work for our community, helping to ensure that people stay safe in the beautiful

        . I'm very grateful for the work that they do. I'm proud to have helped them last year secure a $10,000 grant to refurbish their rescue vessel, the

        .

        While the expo was rained out, on Saturday the Hairdresser With Heart event went ahead. I'm looking forward to visiting Michelle at her salon. The program launch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_Folk_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Woodford Folk Festival
        </a>
        happened on Saturday night. We're looking forward to that over the Christmas and new year period as well. We had some events that didn't get rained out that were very welcome in our community. I understand the emergency services expo has been postponed. An alternative date will be announced soon. I encourage everybody to get along to, hopefully, a sunny day and a great event.
