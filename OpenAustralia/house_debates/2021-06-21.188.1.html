        I thank the wonderful volunteers from the Marion Historic Village Museum for recently hosting me on a tour of their museum and showing me their exciting plans for extending the exhibition space. The museum was created in 2011 by a small group of volunteers dedicated to preserving and promoting Marion's distinctive cultural heritage. Marion was one of the first townships of Adelaide and is one of only three Adelaide districts designed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_William_Light" rel="nofollow">
         Colonel William Light
        </a>
        , who was Adelaide's first surveyor-general and picked the site for the city of Adelaide. The museum is located behind the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        , formerly the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Methodist Church
        </a>
        established in 1862, on Township Road. The site was originally in the heart of the township of Marion and surrounded by farmland, orchards and grapevines. Of course, before that it was the land of the Kaurna people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The museum and volunteers teach many locals, visitors and school students about the rich history of our local area. It is a community run museum. The collection has come from our local community. People have donated photographs, furniture, clothing, tools, household items and books. I was very impressed with the new exhibition that charts the history of policing in the area. Volunteers also host wonderful walking tours of the area, explaining the rich local farming history, buildings, characters of the district and, of course, our Kaurna heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I give my sincere thanks to the wonderful dedicated volunteers—Chairman Peter Stretton, Secretary Kathy Creer, the tireless David Jarman and all the other volunteers—for the amazing work that they do explaining and preserving our local history.
