        On 1 November, one of my constituents, Mrs Rita Greiner of Arcare Malvern East, celebrated her 100th birthday. As part of the celebrations, her family shared some of Rita's stories of her life of enduring community service. Rita was born in Mogilno, Germany, in 1920, and by 1939, with war looming and in order to escape Nazi persecution, her parents had decided to send Rita to live in Australia. Tragically, she never saw her parents or sisters again. Her first job arriving in Australia was as a nanny to two young children, before training to be a nurse, acquiring certificates in nursing, midwifery, infant welfare and obstetrics. In 1946, Rita travelled to Higgins, where she met her future husband. Together they raised three beautiful children, including twins. As well as working at the local Caulfield Hospital and raising children, Rita always found time to visit people in their homes so she could provide them with support and companionship. But it is her service to Emmy Monash Aged Care that has been an enduring passion. Her time there has spanned a remarkable 50 years, initially as a visiting nurse, before helping to distribute morning tea in order to raise funds for much-needed lifestyle equipment. Rita's long life has been dedicated to community service, and she's a role model to us all. I think we can all agree when Rita says there is no other country like Australia. Happy 100th birthday, Rita.
