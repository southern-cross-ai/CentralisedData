        Yesterday was the completion of a month-long T20 cricket tournament. I was invited by local community leader Satya Yelisetti to join the Springfield Lions Cricket Club. It was the club's first time holding the final tournament awards event. It was fantastic to see members from all parts of Springfield and the surrounding suburbs, who are from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and communities, come together over a common love of cricket. Sporting clubs and groups work hard to promote community, a place to belong and a great environment for those who share an interest. There are over 70 sporting clubs in the Oxley electorate, and they are certainly growing. It's been an incredibly tough year for sport and recreation clubs around the country, who have been unable to meet or even, at times, play contact sport during the COVID-19 restrictions. Club managers, coaches, parents and presidents have all done a fantastic job in keeping up a sense of community connection and involvement throughout the pandemic and have still managed to find innovative ways to increase community involvement and stay connected. I want to congratulate all of the volunteers who have worked so hard during the pandemic to keep community sport, including kids' sport, alive. I look forward to seeing all that is ahead for the Springfield Lions Cricket Club, a new club in my electorate, who are there helping to create fantastic opportunities for our community to come together. I put on record my thanks to everyone for helping put together a wonderful event. I look forward to sharing many more in the area.
