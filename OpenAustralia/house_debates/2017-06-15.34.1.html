        I rise today as I am very proud to congratulate the following Chisholm residents who were acknowledged as part of our nation's honour system and were awarded

        honours. Professor Andrew Gleadow of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Hills" rel="nofollow">

        was made an

         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his service to the earth sciences as an academic and researcher in the field of thermochronology and landscape evolution. Mr Paul Bonsak of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_South" rel="nofollow">
         Blackburn South
        </a>
        received the

        and was recognised for his service to children, having fostered more than 26 children between 1980 and 1998. Mr Bonsak's compassion for children was jointly acknowledged with his service to business, particularly in the water and gas sectors. Mr Norman Fettell of Burwood, who is known as Rex, received the Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to sailing, having designed the Minnow and Sabre class dinghies in the 1970s. Rex is a proud member of the Carrum Sailing Club and

        and his innovation in sailboat design is evident as thousands of sailors worldwide continue to sail in his designs. They are three extremely deserving recipientsâ€”wonderful Australian citizens who contribute to our society and live in the Chisholm electorate.
