        My question is to the Minister for Health. Lakemba Respiratory Clinic is run by the federal government. It's one of the sites the minister referred to in his last answer. The manager of the clinic, Dr Saleh, says he's been forced to borrow vaccines from nearby clinics because his weekly delivery didn't show up. Dr Saleh says:

        We don’t know which day doses will arrive, last week it was Monday, this week we have been told Thursday.

         I'd be pleased to receive the details, because we have a vaccine operation centre which ensures that each week we are achieving full national distribution. There are 8,000 sites. Those are being delivered on a weekly basis. The advice that I have is that they are being achieved. If there are any issues in relation to this particular site, this has not been drawn to my attention. This is one of the issues which we manage on behalf of many members in this House and we've been able to resolve them as and when they arise. I'm not aware that the member has previously made any representations to myself or Operation COVID Shield on this. It doesn't sound like it, in which case—

            The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat for a second. I say to the Minister for Health, the way question time works is that the ministers get the questions. I discourage interjections. We cannot adopt a practice where you ask a question and expect them to answer. Otherwise—and this has happened a couple of times, not just with the Minister for Health—if that is going to be the practice, I'll stop it, and I might stop it by allowing an indulgence on the matter from the target of that. The Minister for Health.

             I would be very pleased to receive any information in relation to this particular facility and I would be happy to provide the details of the provision of vaccines. There is no doubt that every facility is receiving vaccines around the country—as I say, over 8,000 Commonwealth facilities. As well, there is the provision of support for over 800 state facilities. And, if there is any particular evidence and material, we would be pleased to respond to that immediately, as we have done with other members who have made representations. I would also note that there is one element which may affect distribution over the coming days. There is the risk of a transport strike on Friday—
