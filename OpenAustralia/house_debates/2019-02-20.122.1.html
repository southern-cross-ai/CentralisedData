        I want to update you today in relation to phenomes. A phenome is a dynamic fingerprint of your body. By analysing the chemicals in the body, researchers can uncover the complex interactions of genetics, lifestyle and environmental factors that contribute to a person's individual health and their disease risk. The study of phenomes will revolutionise health care. I was pleased that Health Minister Greg Hunt returned to

        in my electorate of Tangney to announce that the Morrison government will provide $10 million to the Australian National Phenome Centre for world-leading research. The Australian National Phenome Centre, at Murdoch University, is Australia's first dedicated phenome laboratory, and brings together all five of WA's universities and leading medical research institutes. It will also connect into the International Phenome Centre Network.

        will be at the forefront of international precision medicine. Murdoch University will foster the billions of researchers like Professors Jeremy Nicholson, Elaine Holmes, Robert Trengove and Ruey Leng Loo. These researchers have a key role in revolutionising the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of serious health challenges like cancer, Alzheimer's, autism and type 2 diabetes. Their research will help to save and transform lives.

        This government is supporting phenome research and the Australian National Phenome Centre at Murdoch University because it will mean real benefits for every Australian. It will help us to live longer and healthier lives, and will bring hope to thousands suffering untreatable and life-threatening diseases. This government's $10 million in funding for the National Phenome Centre comes from our landmark Medical Research Future Fund. This fund will double Australia's investment in health and medical research.
       </p>
       <p>
        The $500 million Australian Genomics Health Futures Mission is a centrepiece of the $1.3 billion national health and medical industry growth plan announced in the 2018-19 budget. This record funding in world-leading research is possible because of good and strong economic management. By keeping our economy strong, we can make record investments in essential health initiatives like medical research.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a world-class health system and a long history of being at the forefront of new medical research breakthroughs. The critical research carried out at the Australian National Phenome Centre at Murdoch University will position Perth and WA as a global leader in precision medicine and will enable quantum leaps in the prediction and treatment of disease.
