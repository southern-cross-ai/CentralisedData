       <p>
        It's appropriate that the House recognises the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Harry" rel="nofollow">
         Dr Harry
        </a>
        Nespolon. He died recently after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. He had practices in the

        and at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He was a caring and compassionate general practitioner, but he was also a strong advocate for public health and for general practice. Harry was actually the first person I rang when I was appointed shadow minister for health. In fact, I rang him before it was even announced, to talk to him about policy issues, and he was a very strong interlocutor every day after that. In fact, on my phone there are text messages from Harry about policy matters relating to COVID-19 which I received just days before he died.

        Harry was also a lot of fun. He was a great character, he was great company, and his conversations would reflect his very broad interests. As well as a medical degree, he attained while working as a general practitioner a Master of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Administration" rel="nofollow">

        , an economics degree—a man after my own heart!—and two law degrees—a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. He played a vital role—and I'm sure the Minister for Health would agree—in our COVID-19 response, suggesting to the government how to deal with telehealth and better incorporate general practice. He was always trying to achieve more. He said at the

        general conference in 2019: 'We should always endeavour to do better, to break the mould, to include voices that haven't been heard, to innovate and to learn.' I will miss Harry. I know that the member for Ballarat, my friend the former shadow minister for health, will miss Harry, and I'm sure many honourable members will miss Harry Nespolon.
