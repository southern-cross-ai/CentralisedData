       <p>
        I wish to inform the House that, in accordance with standing order 222A(a)(viii), the House Appropriations and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Administration Committee
        </a>
        met on Monday to consider
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        security upgrade worksâ€”perimeter security enhancements. As chair of this committee, and in accordance with this standing order, I now report to the House on the committee's consideration of the matter and its recommendation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As honourable members will see from the papers that were tabled on Monday in relation to this motion, the proposed works are for security enhancements which include a fence, a gatehouse facility, replacement of window framing and glazing, and additional vehicle bollards at the perimeter of the southern entrance to Parliament House in line with bollards already in place at other entrances. Honourable members will see that the designs and visual representations of the proposed works are included in these tabled papers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received a briefing from the officers of the Department of Parliamentary Services, which has overall carriage of these building works. This briefing explained the proposed works in detail and the need for the works to strengthen and enhance the existing physical security framework at Parliament House.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its deliberations, the committee noted the importance of balancing security with access to Parliament House, which is rightly known as the people's house. The committee also observed the importance of preserving the valuable and unique heritage of Parliament House, and noted that, accordingly, the Presiding Officers have instructed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
         DPS
        </a>
        to ensure that the final design solution, including all structures, finishes, colours and placement, considers and supports the central reference document, conservation management plan and design principles documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recognised the importance of these works and therefore resolved to recommend to the House that it support this motion to agree to the works.
