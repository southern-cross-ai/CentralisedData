        People here would be aware that there were 13 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases reported overnight in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , which takes us to 31 cases now linked to the so-called Bondi cluster. As a result, I just want constituents and others to be aware that a number of new restrictions have been imposed in New South Wales. If you live and work anywhere in my electorate of Wentworth, including the local government areas of Sydney, Woollahra, Waverley or Randwick, you are now no longer allowed to leave metropolitan Sydney unless the travel is for essential purposes, and that's from 4 pm today for seven days. I know that will interrupt a number of people's school holiday plans and other vacation plans, and I do apologise, but this is too important, obviously. Masks will now be required to be worn indoors at all venues inside Sydney, and we're back to one person per four square metres. Outdoor seating events will now be only at 50 per cent capacity. A particularly important point is that there will no longer be dancing allowed inside. There's a small exception made for weddings, but only for the bridal party, so any other celebrations unfortunately will have to be put on hold for some time.

        I did want to urge people who have been to any of the venues of concern, and that includes

        , any time over the last seven days to please go and get tested. There were about 44,000 people tested in Sydney yesterday, which is good. It's up from 28,000. I know the testing staff are working incredibly hard at the Bondi and
