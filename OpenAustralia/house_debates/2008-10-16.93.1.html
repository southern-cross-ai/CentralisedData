        Today I would like to talk about the positive effects that the Rudd government’s $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy will have on the families and pensioners of my electorate of Deakin. From 8 December each of the 7,069 families with children who receive family tax benefit A by fortnightly instalments in Deakin will receive a one-off payment of $1,000 for each eligible child in their care. That covers 13,008 children in my electorate of Deakin and is a direct boost of over $13 million to the local economy at a time when the global financial crisis is placing an increasing pressure on household budgets that are already stretched by the rising cost of living. This $1,000 one-off payment will also be paid to families who receive family tax benefit A as a lump sum at the end of the financial year when they make their claim, and there are quite a few of those in the electorate as well. Also, the $1,000 one-off payment will be paid to families whose dependent children receive the youth allowance, Abstudy or a benefit from the children’s education scheme payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd government is also delivering for pensioners, seniors and carers by delivering a $4.8 billion down payment for immediate financial help in the lead-up to comprehensive reform of the pension system. In the seat of Deakin over 20 per cent of the electors are over the age of 65, and it is a very important issue out my way. One-off lump sum payments of $1,400 to single pensioners and $2,100 to couple pensioners will be paid to the full range of pensioners. That includes 6,253 single aged pensioners in Deakin and 8,689 pensioner couples; 3,452 disability support pensioners; 443 carer payment recipients; 431 wife and widow B pensioners, partner, widow and bereavement allowees; and 2,459 eligible self-funded retirees in Deakin holding a Commonwealth seniors health card. These payments will also be made to all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Veterans Affairs
        </a>
        service pensioners, veterans income support supplement recipients, Veterans Affairs gold card holders eligible for seniors concession allowance, and those of pension age who are receiving a parenting payment, special benefit or Austudy. The 2,187 people in Deakin who receive a carer allowance will also receive $1,000 for each eligible person being cared for.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pensioner, seniors and carer payments will be made automatically through Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs in the fortnight beginning 8 December 2008. These payments will recognise the additional costs that single pensioners face relative to couples, as many cost-of-living expenses are fixed for the household. As all of these payments will be non-taxable and will not be included for future income-testing purposes, it means the full amount flows through to where it is needed most. This decisive action will strengthen the Australian economy in times of global financial turmoil and will be of great benefit to the people of Deakin and Australia as a whole.
