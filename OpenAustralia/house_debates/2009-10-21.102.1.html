        A number of weeks ago I spoke in this place about the need to prevent a repeat of the disgraceful, immoral and unethical conduct displayed by James Hardie in its attempt to mislead workers and run from its compensation obligations over the deadly effects of asbestos. I announced that I would be working to ensure that Australia plays a leading role in establishing a treaty that would once and for all ban the mining, sale and use of all forms of asbestos throughout the world. I also said that I would work to ensure that our young people would be taught business ethics in our schools and universities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The response by my constituents to this campaign has been incredible. In just one week over 500 residents signed a petition calling on this parliament to ensure that we lead international efforts to establish an anti-asbestos treaty and to promote business ethics. I intend to table this petition in the final sitting week of parliament this year. The response of the people of Lowe to the anti-asbestos campaign demonstrates that the Australian people are fed up with the dishonesty and the deceitful games played time and again by corporate giants such as James Hardie.
       </p>
       <p>
        With this in mind I draw to the attention of the House an article that appeared in last Wednesday’s
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper by Milanda Rout titled ‘Cruel and inhumane squabble puts asbestos victims in limbo’. This article reveals that compensation claims to dying asbestos victims are being delayed because Australia’s two asbestos manufacturers, James Hardie and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSR" rel="nofollow">
         CSR
        </a>
        , are in a legal dispute over their respective share of financial liability. As a result of this feud, James Hardie, now Amoco, and CSR are insisting that victims of asbestos prove which company’s product they were exposed to. This is outrageous. Victims of asbestos have suffered far too long at the hands of corporate immorality and dishonesty. This latest game of corporate bickering merely creates more suffering and pain for the ever-growing number of innocent victims of asbestos who are urgently waiting to settle their compensation claims. I am not one for mincing words on this topic. As I said, this is an absolute disgrace. As a parliament, we must all do what we can to ensure that James Hardie and CSR meet their compensation obligations and ensure that the poisoning of innocent Australians by asbestos never happens again.
