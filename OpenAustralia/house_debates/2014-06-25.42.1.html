       <p>
        The Abbott Liberal government's cruel budget has today claimed another victim: the very successful Deadly Choices program that helped young Aboriginal people in my electorate of Newcastle make better lifestyle choices. This government's shameful inaction has forced the Awabakal Newcastle Aboriginal Co-operative to regretfully end the program, effective immediately. Despite having an in-principle agreement to continue in 2014-15, no written confirmation of funds has come from this government for the program, meaning it ends on 30 June this year. That is next week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deadly Choices was created by the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health and focused on educating and empowering young Aboriginal people to make healthy choices to help avoid long-term health issues. Healthy lifestyle workers hosted community days and ran health and fitness programs for Aboriginal people in Newcastle, focusing on preventative health measures such as healthy diet and exercise and the importance of quitting smoking. The program also connected with local high schools, teaching young Aboriginal people about leadership, healthy relationships and empowerment through connection to culture.

        Don McCaskill has said that ending Deadly Choices is a significant blow to Newcastle's efforts in closing the gap in health inequality. I agree. The Prime Minister has said he would be a Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs. He has also said we should be guided by his government's actions, not their titles. On either measure he is failing Aboriginal people in Newcastle.
