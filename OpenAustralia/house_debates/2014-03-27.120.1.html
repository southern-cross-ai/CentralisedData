       <p>
        Recently I had the great pleasure to present local sporting champion grants to some of our dynamic young sports boys and girls at an afternoon tea in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . The Local Sporting Championship program is an Australian government initiative designed to provide financial assistance for young people aged between 12 and 18.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the following rising stars. Berwick's Sophia Locandro, who received her grant to play in the school sport Australian basketball championships. At just 13 years of age, Sophia is already a veteran of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandenong_Rangers" rel="nofollow">

        representative system. Sophia first started playing at the age of just seven after watching her older cousins get so much enjoyment out of the sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rachel Guy received her grant to attend the Australian women's under-15 hockey championships. Rachel is determined to play hockey for Australia one day. But for now, the 15-year-old from Berwick has her sights set on winning gold at the hockey championships. Rachel took out top goal scorer in the Waverley under-14s girls team last year, scoring an incredible 23 goals throughout the season.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emerald's Bryce Haesler is a local gymnast who is being helped to participate in the Australian championships. Sixteen-year-old Bryce was previously selected for the state squad and has picked up a gold medal. Bryce began gymnastics at the age of two.

        hockey player Samantha Wagg received a grant for the national indoor hockey championships. Samantha's parents, Phil and Sandi, played the sport in the state league. Samantha made her Victorian debut at the Pacific School Games a few years ago, where she and her teammates settled for a runners-up finish to the

       </p>
       <p>
        Belgrave South's 14-year-old Jessica Brown has received a grant to help with her expenses to attend the Australian Interschool Equestrian Championships. The nine-year-old

        student has been training with her 19-year-old horse, Lakevale Wizardâ€”known as Wiz. Jessica is a member of the Hallam Valley Pony Club. Year 9 student, Aaron Currie at Fountain Gate Secondary College was presented with the grant for outstanding performance in his chosen sport, lacrosse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations must also go to other grant recipients: Mike Jarrod and the Target Rifle Victoria Team for the youth national championships,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dawson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for his participation in the under-19 boys softball championships, Hayden Trezise for under-17 boys softball championships, Montana Chavasse for School Sports Victoria under-12 girls softball and Dylan Donnelly for the under-14 nationals. I congratulate all these fantastic sports stars.
