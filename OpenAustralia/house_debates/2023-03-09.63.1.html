       <p>
        I want to update the community on a number of very important projects funded by the former coalition government that are soon to be completed. The first is the Sportlink redevelopment in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_South" rel="nofollow">
         Vermont South
        </a>
        , which is going to assist the Whitehorse Netball Association, and anybody associated with Sportlink will see that it's taking shape. The roof is on. The courts have been upgraded to ensure better lighting and a better outcome for spectators as well. The Sportlink redevelopment is due to be completed in March, and we'll very soon have our young netballers enjoy this new facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cheong Park Pavilion upgrade, which I kicked off with a half a million dollar grant a few years ago, is now completed. It's formally opening in April and is assisting the Croydon South Football Club, the Croydon South Cricket Club, and, of course, U3A Croydon will be able to get some use out of it as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dorset Recreation Reserve, which I think will be the best soccer facility in the eastern suburbs, is very soon to be completed, providing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon_City_Arrows" rel="nofollow">
         Croydon City Arrows
        </a>
        and our local Burmese community with an outstanding new facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the Heatherdale pavilion, which I kicked off with a $2 million grant, is going to assist the Heatherdale Cricket Club and the Heathmont Jets Juniors Football Club. We're very excited to open it.
