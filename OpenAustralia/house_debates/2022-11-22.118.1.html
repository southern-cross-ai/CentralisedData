        In the second week of October I hopped on my pushbike for my fifth annual Tour de Fisher. Each year I cycle the length and breadth of the Fisher electorate holding listening posts in local parks and cafes. This year, I think, was the biggest yet, with 23 listening posts in 23 towns over 4½ days. It began with a launch in chaotic weather from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Kings Beach
        </a>
        , which almost blew us away. I held a listening post in Beerburrum's new cafe, Cafe Phillies, and I was treated to an impromptu question time at Montville State School. I called on Labor to come to the table on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        rail from Beerwah station, and I visited businesses right across Fisher, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippy_Downs" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Each time I'm reminded that we really do live in the greatest place on earth, the Sunshine Coast, and it's largely thanks to the people who call it home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only a week later I joined leaders and volunteers from across the Sunshine Coast for the annual Fisher Community Awards. I want to send out my gratitude and enormous thanks and praise to Kim McCosker, our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
         MC
        </a>
        ; to Priscilla and the Caloundra Power Boat Club; and to Brenda at Brenco Trophies for their support. Each year, we honour those unsung, fantastic people in Fisher. I'm not going to say that phrase 'unsung heroes', because I think that is totally overdone, but it's those amazing people, who often go without recognition, that make Fisher the place to be for education, employment and retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I spoke about students of the year yesterday, I want to acknowledge a few more of the award winners from the Fisher awards night. We had the Fisher Educator of the Year, Mr Murray Finch, who, after 40 years, continues to teach at Caloundra State High School. Forty years, Deputy Speaker Freelander—can you imagine being a paediatrician for 40 years? You probably can, actually!

          Murray Finch is inspiring active living and is offering boys a valuable male role model. Fisher Education Provider of the Year was Kairos Community College, Caloundra, whose unique approach to holistic group learning is giving vulnerable and otherwise disengaged young people the chance to realise their potential and to graduate from high school. Fisher Business of the Year was the

          and Stu Anderson have created a million-dollar landscaping and drainage business which is creating jobs and funding local community groups through campaigns like the Give Me 5 For Kids Appeal. The Fisher Educator of the Year, GreaseBoss, are fast becoming an

          and high-tech manufacturing icon across industries, all while supporting men's mental health. The Fisher Employee of the Year, Josie Tully, is a proud Gamilaraay woman and commercial analyst at HeliMods, whose work in and beyond the workplace is empowering young people and women to thrive. Fisher Senior of the Year, Cath Scully, is making a difference to the isolated and those in palliative care through her writing, radio, dance teaching and personal support. The Fisher Senior Group of the Year was Uniforms 4 Kids, who have provided over 3,000 items of clothing for young people in need by connecting law enforcement and first responders with a hardworking team of artisans in Caloundra. I actually jumped behind the sewing machine and helped them out once. It doesn't happen very often, but I did it that day.
         </p>

          The Fisher Environmental Leader of the Year was Mooloolah River Landcare, whose education, citizen science and practical environmental initiatives are engaging locals across generations to protect our local environment.

         <p>
          The Andrew Wallace Community Group of the Year was the Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club, sometimes referred to as South Alex. This surf lifesaving club celebrated 100 years of lifesaving patrol and community service. Thank you to all the clubbies at Mooloolaba for your vigilance and service, and thank you to all those who took part in the program.
