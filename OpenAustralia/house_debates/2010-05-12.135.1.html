       <p>
        I would like to speak about one of the top priorities for real action in the electorate of Boothby. Over the last 13 years, residents of Belair in the electorate of Boothby have faced two major bushfires, posing a real threat to lives and homes. Woody weeds, in particular feral olives, which are widespread in the Mitcham Hills, have been identified as a major fire hazard, with olives being highly flammable. As a key bushfire prevention strategy, the local country fire service and Mitcham Council are committed to olive tree eradication. They are to be commended for their efforts in reducing fuel loads through the clearing of olives, with Mitcham Council investing approximately $300,000 per annum to this cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, the Leader of the Opposition and I met with the Mayor of Mitcham, Ivan Brooks, the local country fire service and local residents at a site in Belair which was partially cleared of olive trees. We heard and saw firsthand the difficulties facing the local community, firefighters and council workers. We observed the work involved in removing an olive tree.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mediterranean climate, with its mild winter temperatures and hot summers, of the Mitcham Hills makes the area prone to olive infestation. Controlling and minimising the spread of these weeds is a difficult task and it is too big a job for the local council and the local community to manage. As a result direct action is required. What is required is more funding and support if we are to have any hope of improving the situation for the local community and preserving the natural environment for our children in the future. There is a twofold priority here: revegetation of bushland but also reduction of the fire risk. Intensive labour is required if we are to make an impact on areas of major environmental degradation and ensure the preservation of wilderness areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year, in January, the Leader of the Opposition announced that, if a coalition government were elected, a strong environmental workforce would be established—a standing green army. This green army would comprise 15,000 members. It would be available on an ongoing basis and supplemented by volunteers to tackle the local and regional environmental priorities that most urgently need a sustained application of labour.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate, the council, working with about six workers, has made a real impact in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Hill_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Brown Hill Creek
        </a>
        . They have made an impact starting from the top of the hill’s face and working down in restoring bushland to its original state and reducing these very hardy olives. But there is much more that needs to be done, and a green army of 15,000 members spread across 150 electorates would mean 100 people in each electorate being available to work on local environmental projects. So if a Liberal-National Party government is elected then I will be pushing hard to see that one of the first weed eradication projects for the green army will be in the bushland of the Mitcham Hills. The Mitcham council is making a good fist of this, but they need reinforcements, and that is where I see the green army coming in.
