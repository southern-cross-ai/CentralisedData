       <p>
        In the 12 months campaigning as a candidate pre-the 2013 election, in the hope of winning the seat of Reid—obviously an extremely culturally diverse seat—I heard time and time again from the constituents there of the need for aged-care facilities that were empathetic of culturally and linguistically diverse communities. I know that Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou would know this from her background. After being elected, it was great to hear from Dr Abdurrahman Asaroglu at the Gallipoli mosque, in early 2014, that the mosque, in Auburn, had acquired a significant parcel of land next to it and had turned its attention to building a culturally sensitive aged-care facility for the Turkish community and other Islamic communities in our patch of Sydney. We lobbied the then minister, Minister Fifield, extensively. At the end of 2015 or early 2016, we secured a $10 million capital grant as well as some 86 bed licences. The Turkish community in Auburn went to work immediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was, indeed, a great thrill yesterday with Minister Wyatt—a great mate of mine, who jumped on a plane and came across from Perth the night before—to open this outstanding facility, the Gallipoli Home. Already, quietly over the past few weeks, 40 residents have moved in. There have been additional beds put in. It will ultimately be home to 102 local Turkish elders. This facility, under the magnificent stewardship of Dr Abdurrahman and the mosque board, will offer outreach to the local community—far broadening the reach beyond what was originally envisaged.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also a fantastic occurrence that yesterday signified 50 years to the day that the first plane load of Turkish immigrants arrived in Australia in 1968—at 5 pm on that Sunday, to be precise. It was a really fantastic coincidence, which was obviously chosen on purpose for the launch. I would like to, again, thank not just Dr Abdurrahman but the boards that we have dealt with over the past three to four years. It's a real thrill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned in my maiden speech my desire—and when we all get here we do try and set out what we stand for and what we hope to deliver. This has been an amazing delivery for the community—the irony of which is that I lost that part of Sydney in the last redistribution. That said, they've never made me feel anything but part of that community, and yesterday was no exception. Congratulations to all involved. It was a thrill to be with you, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
