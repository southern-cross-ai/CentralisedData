        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, the government introduces the 2023-24 Additional Estimates
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        s. These bills are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These bills underpin the government's expenditure decisions made since the 2023-24 budget that relate to the 2023-24 financial year, including decisions made in the 2023-24 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2023 MYEFO continued the government's responsible economic and fiscal management, which has helped deliver the first budget surplus in 15 years and helped ease inflationary pressures at their peak.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fiscal position has further improved in the MYEFO with lower deficits and gross debt now forecast across the forward estimates compared to the 2023-24 budget. This is great news, indeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks approval for appropriations of approximately $8.7 billion from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        . This would ensure that there is sufficient funding available to cover estimate variations for existing programsâ€”for example, changes in costs for demand driven programs. The bill would also provide funding for the 2023-24 financial year costs of measures announced since the 2023-24 budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically, the bill provides funding to support the following significant items.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence will receive close to $2 billion. This primarily reflects a reclassification of $1.6 billion from capital to operating funding reflecting updated expenditure requirements, $213 million for operations undertaken in 2021-22 and 2022-23, and $174 million for changes in foreign exchange rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Social Services portfolio will receive over $1.4 billion, with the majority of the funding for the National Disability Insurance Agency to provide reasonable and necessary supports for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive approximately $1.1 billion. This includes $537 million to support older Australians in receiving appropriate care, and $99 million for the community pharmacy sector's transition to maximum dispensing quantity changes and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will receive approximately $807 million, which includes over $650 million to support employers who have engaged apprentices and trainees.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to say that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        will receive close to $696 million to safeguard national security interests and critically to improve cybersecurity and security of critical infrastructure assets.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very pleased that Services Australia will receive close to $344 million, including $232 million for additional frontline and service delivery staff to help reduce claim backlogs and support more timely access to government services. I take this opportunity to thank all of those staff of Centrelink, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Support_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         Child Support Agency
        </a>
        and Medicare for the great work that they do in supporting Australians and representing the government in delivering those critical services. I take note of the great work that Centrelink staff did in relation to the recent cyclone events in Cairns and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        . They were on the ground quickly, supporting people in affected regions. This is just an example of the sort of work for which additional estimates appropriations are needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Industry, Science and Resources will receive approximately $338 million, including for the decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour floating oil production and offtake facility and the implementation of the Modern Manufacturing Initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Signals Directorate will receive over $257 million to deliver on the government's foreign signals intelligence and cybersecurity objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will receive over $230 million, including $207 million for costs incurred on the national interest account managed by Export Finance Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Treasury" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Treasury
        </a>
        will receive approximately $213 million, which includes around $175 million for Housing Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill, the explanatory memorandum, and the portfolio additional estimates statements which are tabled in parliament today.
       </p>
       <p>
        With those comments, I commend the bill to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
