        We have a despairing

        who are just asking the state Labor government for some progress on roads. The sad reality is that in the city of Redland every single road project right now is federally funded, with the exception of the traffic light duplication fiasco in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cotton" rel="nofollow">

        where the state government put the traffic lights in the wrong place. The

        bypass was promised by the Labor state candidate at the last election. He promised hundreds of people as they walked past on election day. But there is no money. It's just a feasibility study, which you can't drive on. I'm now funding, through the council, that Victoria Point upgrade. With special vehicle permits needed for many roads in my electorate, I'm funding upgrades to culverts along Woodlands Drive, so that trucks and cranes don't have to take large detours around Woodlands Drive.

        But we have a state MP up there,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Richards" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Richards
        </a>
        , who's just too busy scouring mudflats for wrecks that she can identify. This is about relieving congestion for curlews more than it is for humans on the roads. She's busy building three bus stops but not a cent for the roads in between, because she forgets that buses need the roads in between the bus stops! We've got these magnificent artistic renditions of bus stops, but no state investment on roads themselves. Like that great leader who looked at things and pointed at things, in Redlands we have Kim, Don and Tom—the three state Labor figures—doing nothing, pointing, umming and ahing, but not investing. It's time to see real progress on roads in Redlands, because it just isn't happening at the moment, and locals deserve more.
