       <p>
        I rise to advise the House of a new and emerging business that has just opened its doors in my electorate. I was fortunate enough to be at this small business restaurant opening the other night. All in this place know the importance of the small business sector in the Australian economy and the effect that it has on employment. Scott and Fiona Roebig are behind the small business, which is doing very well. They have opened a restaurant called Thom and Ann's Deli Restaurant. You may ask yourself why people named Scott and Fiona would open a restaurant in the names of Thom and Ann. It is because they have dedicated their substantial investment to their children, Thom and Ann. At the opening of the function the other day, the kids were running around, and you could just see the pride that Scott and Fiona had in setting up a business that hopefully one day they would be able to give to their kids.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opening was a private function, and they very strategically had some of their stakeholders with them. They had there with them their bank managers, their financiers, both sets of their parents—who I think played a little bit of the financier's role—their architects and their accountants. It was an excellent night. I hope to go back to that business in many years time and see them profitably trading. They have an enormous work ethic. Scott is the chef and Fiona, who has such a wonderful personality, is up-front. Do yourselves a favour when you are next at Yarrabilba and pop in and have a lemonade at Thom and Ann's Deli Restaurant.
