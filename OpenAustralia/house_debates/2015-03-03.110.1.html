        This year marks the Centenary of Anzacâ€”100 years since that fateful landing at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaba_Tepe" rel="nofollow">
         Gaba Tepe
        </a>
        , now known to us as Anzac Cove, which forever altered our national identity and place in the world. On 25 April, across Australia we will pause and remember the service and sacrifice of those who have proudly served our nation, those who gave their tomorrow for our today. The Anzac Centenary will be one of the most significant commemorations to take place in our lifetime. Anzac Day goes beyond the anniversary of the landing at Gaba Tepe in 1915. It encapsulates and embodies the human qualities of courage, mateship and sacrifice, qualities valiantly displayed by Australians over the years in times of war and conflict and in peacekeeping operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since my election, I have had the great pleasure of working with local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branches, historical societies, surf clubs and local councils to ensure the Dobell community is well represented in and benefits from the array of commemorative activities. The Dobell Centenary of Anzac committee considered many exceptional proposals that captured both the significance of the centenary and the importance of community involvement in the commemoration.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Wyong Family History Group has designed pull-up banners that celebrate the values of courage, mateship and sacrifice, and honour local young men who fought in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . Mr John Selwood from the Wyong Family History Group said that the banners will be 'an account of our local community's war service and sacrifice that will be displayed throughout the local area at various venues'. The banners will provide an opportunity for people to learn about and reflect upon Wyong's contribution to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        . I recently visited the Wyong Family History Group to congratulate them on their efforts and I was most impressed by the degree of detail contained in the banners.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Centenary of Anzac affords us the opportunity to impart the significance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        legend to future generations of Australians. The Toukley and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         The Entrance
        </a>
        -Long Jetty RSL sub-branches have developed projects that will ensure that the legacy and significance of the ANZAC legend will be passed on to younger Australians. It is imperative that our children understand the service and sacrifice that forged our nation's destiny on the world stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Toukley RSL Sub Branch will install commemorative stones and bronze plaques at each of the 10 schools within their area, a lasting memorial and recognition of the ANZAC legend. The president of the sub-branch, Mr Bob Wilson, said: 'Our sub-branch wanted to share the legacy of the ANZAC in our local schools and ensure that their sacrifice has an everlasting place in our local community.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The Entrance-Long Jetty RSL Sub Branch will supply specially designed medallions to primary school students within their area as a lasting reminder of the special occasion. Sub-branch president Mr Alan Fletcher
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        has been working closely with local schools to ensure that their students are part of the commemoration. I recently attended the official opening of the Anzac Centenary display at The Entrance-Long Jetty RSL Sub Branch museum. It is anticipated that thousands of students and members of the public will visit this display in the coming months, in the lead-up to Anzac Day. I want to acknowledge and thank the volunteers who run and maintain this museum for their dedication and effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to local services and the aforementioned projects, Dobell residents also plan to commemorate the centenary abroad. Members of the Soldiers Beach Surf Life Saving Club are marking Anzac Day by participating in a commemorative event on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Gallipoli Peninsula
        </a>
        , with support from the Toukley sub-branch and the Doyalson-Wyee RSL Club. The event is a commemorative row by Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        surf-lifesaving clubs, retracing the path of the original British flotilla which was the precursor to the Gallipoli landings. The row proceeds through the Dardanelles, around the Gallipoli Peninsula, and finishes south of Anzac Cove on the eve of the 100th anniversary of that fateful landing. The boat used by the Soldiers Beach Surf Life Saving Club will be donated to the Turkish surf-lifesaving movement on the Gallipoli Peninsula as a gift from the Soldiers Beach community. It should also be acknowledged that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        rowers are direct descendants of people who have served in numerous Australian campaigns. The row is a mark of respect to their relatives' contribution to our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am extremely proud to be working with a community that is so passionate about and dedicated to ensuring the Centenary of Anzac is commemorated by all. I would like to personally thank the members of the Dobell Anzac Centenary committee for their time and assistance in ensuring that our local community benefits from the best possible projects to mark the Centenary of Anzac. I also want to thank the many members of local organisations who have volunteered their time to develop these projects on behalf of the broader community. This will be a hugely significant moment for all Australians and a time that we will reflect upon for many years to come.
