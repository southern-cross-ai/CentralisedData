        On 23 September, I attended the annual presentation evening of the St George Basketball Association, down at Club Central Hurstville, and as always it was a fantastic event, with lots of great players recognised. It was terrific to be able to present the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards on the night, as I've done for a number of years now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge the committee that manages the St George Basketball Association so well: Ray Barbi, the president, for his leadership and vision for the basketball community in our area; Anna Pazanin, the administrator, who's done so much for our community; Elizabeth Chipman, the secretary, who, when she's not running cricket competitions, is running basketball competitions; and all the other members of the committee who were there on the night. More than a thousand people play basketball through the St George Basketball Association, and I commend them for their efforts.

        On 19 September, kids from Revesby Public School visited my electorate office. They were doing a walking trip around Revesby, going to various places along the way. They also went to St Joseph Banks High, Broderick Gillawarna School and the Beechwood nursing home. There was a large group of kids, about 40 kids, and they were from the stage 3 group. Narelle Nies, the principal, was leading the group along with a number of teachers. It was great to see them. The school has a very proud history and dates back to 1896, so it is one of the very oldest schools anywhere in my electorate, and also the only school in my electorate with its own museum about its historyâ€”a history of which the school is justifiably proud. I'm really looking forward to seeing the short film that the kids were making on the day, and thank you to them all for their visit.

        On 25 September, I attended the end of season presentation night for the St Charbel Netball Club at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lewis" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Lewis
        </a>
        . The club was only started about three years ago, but more than 100 girls participate in the Canterbury-Bankstown netball competition. It's a great credit to the club president, Madonna Ghajar. I also acknowledge Reverend Father Maroun Youssef, the Principal of St Charbel's College, who was there, and, of course, Father Superior El Ferekh for his leadership of the St Charbel's community and the broader Maronite community in my area. It was fantastic to see the girls there on the night, so enthusiastic and so dedicated to their sport. Congratulations to everyone involved in St Charbel's Netball Club.
