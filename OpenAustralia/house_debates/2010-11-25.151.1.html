        Several weeks ago, I hosted the inaugural Bennelong trilevel government meeting, bringing together federal, state and council leaders on a quarterly basis. These meetings will address collaboration on projects where limited resources were previously wasted due to duplication. Inevitably, the topics for discussion centre on overdevelopment and the inadequate provision of infrastructure. Bennelong faces a dire situation due to a lack of long-term planning and the impact that has on our daily lives. Not a day goes by without a different situation raising its head to add to this condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month I spoke of the state government using its part 3A powers of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        planning laws to overrule council decisions on the establishment of high-density housing. As an example, the former Channel 7 site in Mobbs Lane, Epping, will now have 800 apartments—in a lane. Where is the infrastructure to support these people? Where is the planning? Last week I met with senior managers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Australia
        </a>
        regarding an electricity substation next door to residential homes in Buffalo Road, Ryde. Despite the $40 million price tag, the costs to the community of exposure to high levels of electromagnetic fields were mostly ignored and consideration was only given to community consultation after the property was secured. We have seen Telstra and Optus towers in Ryde and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         North Ryde
        </a>
        being proposed, again with insufficient community consultation, requiring multiple meetings with the management of both companies to improve their dialogue and assess alternative sites.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday I read a report by an independent think tank called Lateral Economics which described New South Wales as ‘groaning under the weight of a widely recognised infrastructure crisis’. The report went on to comment that our constituents are paying for this lack of long-term planning:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … they are paying with inflated tolls on roads … they are paying with their time as they wait at peak hour in traffic … Indeed, these problems explain no small part the below average economic growth of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        itself since these policies took hold.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even Labor councillor Alison McLaren was quoted as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “The government can no longer justify deferring critical transport projects such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West" rel="nofollow">
         South West
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West" rel="nofollow">
         North West
        </a>
        rail links …”
       </p>
       <p>
        The Epping to Parramatta rail link must be added to this critical list.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we have the ridiculous situation regarding a road over the M2 freeway, called Murray Farm bridge. This road carries 1,000 cars an hour during peak-hour periods and connects the two parts of Beecroft split by the M2. The Murray Farm bridge is due to be closed for a period of 10 months while widening work is done on the freeway. The proposed alternative route takes locals on a roundabout journey, down back streets, through black spots and past several schools, all leading to a 30-minute drive time for a two-kilometre journey. Give me a break.
       </p>
       <p>
        Add to this the development of the Royal Rehabilitation Centre in Ryde, which will offer some benefits to the community. But, again, I ask: where is the planning? The traffic generated from 791 apartments will funnel onto
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Morrison Road
        </a>
        , which is already running at three times over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTA" rel="nofollow">
         RTA
        </a>
        operational capacity. I have been meeting with stakeholders on this matter since February. I must also declare a personal interest, as I have recently bought a house just off Morrison Road. The absolute inefficiency and the cost of this total lack of long-term planning is frightening. To quote Lateral Economics again:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the citizens of NSW are realising that their long term interests have still fallen victim to short-termism.
       </p>
       <p>
        The important consideration is that this is a national problem that requires a national solution. It is our job as representatives to plan for the future and make provision for the necessary infrastructure as we grow. We are suffering from the super cost and compromise of the retrofitting of infrastructure. This must be replaced in the future by serious, well-considered long-term planning. Trilevel government collaboration should be an important component of the development of planning and the implementation of that infrastructure. This cooperation is in the best interests of our constituents. These matters are of the utmost importance.
