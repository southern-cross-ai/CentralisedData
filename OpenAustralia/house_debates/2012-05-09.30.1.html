        It is my pleasure to rise and acknowledge a couple of the community organisations and events I have recently been to. Firstly I thank ROPE, which is a respite centre for people with disabilities, who recently hosted the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers,

        , and myself. We had the opportunity to talk to some of the clients and also to the staff and the volunteers about the great work they do. On the weekend, ROPE put on an art exhibition, which was a fantastic exhibition of art done by the clients. The day that the parliamentary secretary and I visited ROPE was also the day of the

        rally, which both the parliamentary secretary and I attended in the city. It was great to see so many familiar faces there supporting the NDIS.
       </p>

        I also acknowledge the Regional Community Association Moreton Bay, who last week held a candle-lighting ceremony for domestic violence. I thank them for putting on this service. A couple of the speakers were women who have been personally affected by domestic violence. As difficult as it was to listen to their stories, it is so important that we get those stories out so that people's awareness is lifted, so that we do not remain silent on domestic violence and so that we stand up and take action.
