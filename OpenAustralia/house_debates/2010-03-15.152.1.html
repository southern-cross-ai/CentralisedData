       <p>
        For many years there have been problems in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander Heights
        </a>
        with the bushland adjacent to Highview Park. It is an open space that is thick with trees and shrubs and is interspersed with tracks made illegally by four-wheel drive vehicles and trail bikes. These vehicles not only damage the flora and disturb the local residents but, in the case of the four-wheel drives, are also responsible for some dumped garbage. On first hearing about this problem during the 2007 election campaign, I asked the local government, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to act. They said that it was a state government matter. As I recall, the state had already been asked to intervene but did nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I then raised the matter again with the new state government in 2009, asking them to fence this open space and thereby restrict access, reducing the noise and dumped garbage problems. In giving me a hearing, the state minister originally said that fencing was not possible, due to the trees along the border. I did not accept that but instead provided the Minister for Planning, Culture and the Arts,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , with photographs and further information, which resulted in him accepting the need for fencing. The fencing will stop the vehicle use and protect the flora of this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later in 2009 I was contacted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Walsh" rel="nofollow">

        ,

        </a>
        , who told me that he was responsible for the fencing project. We have spoken on several occasions about it. Last week the fencing work began. I am very pleased that I was able to achieve this result for local people in Alexander Heights. I take this opportunity to thank Minister John Day, Sean Walsh and the local people who raised this problem with me.
