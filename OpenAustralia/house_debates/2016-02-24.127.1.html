        What a remarkable juxtaposition we saw this weekend in the nation's two most populous cities. In Melbourne, the nation's cultural capital, the Victorian government supported
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Night" rel="nofollow">
         White Night
        </a>
        , which saw the city open from 6pm to 6am, with live music across the city, art installations and street parties, it brought half a million revellers of all ages passing through the city. It was a credit to the Victorian government—including my friend, the Minister for

        . It kept Melbourne ahead of the pack; not just as the most liveable city but also as the most culturally vibrant.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Sydney, by contrast, a protest of over 10,000 was held to 'Keep Sydney Open'. They were protesting the lockout laws imposed by the previous Premier and now defended wholeheartedly by the neo-puritan

        . Baird has really poked the bear, as it were, with his recent Facebook post defending the laws attracting over 17,000 comments, mostly from angry Sydneysiders fed up with the laws. Now Queensland looks like following New South Wales' lead and imposing its own lockout. Senator—

        —Lazarus wants a national lockout law, but the problem is that, just like those shorts Senator Lazarus wore to his ABC interview yesterday, Sydney's lockout laws are not one-size-fits-all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, Victoria was the first state to trial lockout laws. In 2008, the Brumby government trialled a 2am lockout, which was scrapped after just three months. There were many reasons that the lockout did not work, but the main point is that it pushed people outside and isolated drunk people in the streets, walking around aimlessly, frustrated they could not get in anywhere. It put pressure on police to protect the streets. Inside a bar or club, we know that responsible service of alcohol restrictions apply, and we know all clubs have security.

        I suspect most parents would agree with me that, while we would love our kids to be in bed by 12, we would prefer them to be inside rather than outside a licensed premises drinking or dancing. And, of course, the high prices inside ought to slow their drinking down. After all, police report that for approximately every 1,000 assaults in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne CBD

        says assault rates are down in his city. True, but patronage and traffic in the areas has been affected massively. Of course, fewer people in those areas means fewer assaults, but that does not balance the negative impact these lockouts have on the economy, jobs, the hospitality industry and the viability of artistic venues. What will happen if the Oxford Art Factory closes down? It might not affect the Premier, who would prefer

        The tragic deaths of young men coward-punched by drunken louts in Sydney which precipitated these lockout laws occurred early in the night.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Kings Cross
        </a>
        at 10pm. His killer, according to
        <i>
         The Saturday Paper
        </i>
        , had been predrinking since 5pm. Daniel Christie's life was cut short by a coward punch at 9pm. These were tragic and shocking events. We all feel the devastation of our communities in seeing such promising young lives cut short by drunken violence, but we also see that the problem is not at a particular time or place, nor is it about access to licensed venues.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are always ways of tackling alcohol fuelled violence without forcing the closure of the entire nightlife of a city. The easiest thing to do is not always the smartest. Lockouts are easy and popular, but they have side effects. Victoria succeeds without lockouts because police work with licensees. The late police inspector,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Warren
        </a>
        , helped set up the Melbourne Licensees Forum, and there are many visionary police officers who have helped since. They work together to combat violence. Move-on laws with appropriate fines, increased police presence and safety officers are all measures that can and do work to reduce violence in the streets. Another great measure in Melbourne has been the 24-hour public transport on weekends, giving young people the chance to get home quickly and safely without having to clamour for a taxi or hang around for hours on the streets, drunk, waiting for morning services.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        We also need to consider that, if people get off lightly for less serious but still violent offences, the wrong message is being sent. There is little point doubling sentences for killers but giving good behaviour bonds to people who throw punches but are lucky that their victims do not fall and hit their heads. All punches are dangerous and all punches can kill. It is never okay to throw a punch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps New South Wales premiers should learn from Victoria. To curb violence, you do not need to gut the night-life, force places to close, force licensees to lose customers and give young people nowhere to go. Victoria should keep its present laws and keep supporting the arts, music and a vibrant night-life. Others will fall behind.
