        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the Morrison-Joyce government is ensuring our strong economic recovery by investing in infrastructure projects and creating jobs in regional Australia?

         I'd like to thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Wide Bay
         </a>
         for his question. I note the great work the member for Wide Bay has done, especially with regard to road safety, and part of the process of road safety was the upgrade of the Tiaro bypass. I remember that he worked with the member for Riverina to make sure that that was the safest possible outcome, because he was very aware of what was most precious in the work that he has done, especially as a policeman, and that's the saving of lives. Infrastructure has been part and parcel of what this coalition government has done, what the Nationals and the Liberals have done, because we know that, of the 7.7 million square kilometres that make up this nation, over five million square kilometres are held by coalition members and about 1.5 square kilometres are held by Labor members, with the balance being held by Independents. Mind you, 1.35 square kilometres make up one electorate, so we have to be very mindful of the length and breadth of this nation and how Australians do not just reside in capital cities. That's what makes us a coalition government looking after the nation, rather than a Labor government that has forgotten about its regional areas and has retreated predominantly to the inner suburbs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of the process of looking after that huge expanse of our nation is the Building Better Regions Fund. I'd like to thank the Expenditure Review Committee and all those who fought for a further $100 million so that we could look after the disparity in what has happened between those investments in the capitals and those investments in the regions. The state coalition government in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         has now invested close to half a billion dollars in one project in the member for Sydney's electorate, which is an art gallery. We in the coalition have been making sure things get funded in regional areas, such as in the Hunter electorate and the Hunter Sports Centre at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
          Lake Macquarie
         </a>
         . It was great to go to Lake Macquarie, in the Hunter electorate, to make sure that they got $10 million so they could build that facility for $25.7 million. It was at this facility that my daughter Odette ran in the state championships. The fund also allowed us to put $5 million into the Swimming and Fitness Centre at Palmerston in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . I know the member for Solomon was a great advocate for that project. I also commend the member for Lingiari, who also wrote a letter of support for that project. Then there's the Birubi Point Aboriginal Place and Tourism and Information Centre in the Labor-held seat of Paterson, and how important that was. This goes to show that we are focusing on regional Australia, making sure we grow this nation, not just in pockets but across the length and breadth of this great country.
