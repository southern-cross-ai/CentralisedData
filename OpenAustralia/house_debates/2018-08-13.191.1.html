       <p>
        The Turnbull government continues to demonstrate a blatant disrespect for our veterans, which absolutely astounds me. The Prime Minister has ignored calls from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , the Royal Australian Regiment Association, the Alliance of Defence Services Organisation and many ex-service organisations, veterans and current serving members, and the Turnbull government has continually and repeatedly ignored all calls from current serving personnel and veterans to include the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is essential that we know that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">
         CSC
        </a>
        is working in the best interests of current and former ADF personnel, and it must be included in the royal commission. Just before the Longman by-election, the Prime Minister reiterated that he does not support the royal commission including the CSC. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        Turnbull government has turned its back on our service men and women. Labor has listened, and we want to see the CSC included in the royal commission. Labor's shadow minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Rishworth" rel="nofollow">
         Amanda Rishworth
        </a>
        , has written to the Turnbull government's veterans' affairs minister on several occasions, to no avail, which simply shows just how out of touch this government is in refusing to act in the best interests of current and serving personnel and veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I have launched a campaign calling on the Turnbull government to include the CSC in the banking royal commission. I urge all members of our ADF, veterans and ex-serving communities to visit my Facebook page, to click on the link and to sign the petition. We must let the Prime Minister know that this is a very important issue for veterans.
