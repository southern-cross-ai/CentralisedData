       <p>
        Today in Queensland is state government budget day. I just thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast what the state government has done for the good people of Queensland as opposed to what the federal government is doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's have a quick look at what the federal government is doing for the good people of Queensland, particularly in my patch, from an infrastructure perspective. State-wise, $110 billion is in our infrastructure program, and $3.5 billion of that has been committed by the federal government to road and rail projects which are going to benefit the people of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        . There was $808 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        upgrade, Caloundra Road to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Motorway
        </a>
        , 80 per cent of which was funded by the federal government. If you listen to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bailey" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Bailey
        </a>
        , the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, you would think it was funded 100 per cent by Queensland. They're only funding it to the tune of 20 per cent. There was $800 million for the Bruce Highway, Cooroy to Curra, section D; $500 million for the Bruce Highway, Caboolture-Bribie Island Road to Steve Irwin Way; $130 million for the Deception Bay Road interchange. All of these works are funded 80 per cent by the federal government and 20 per cent by the state government. There was $12 million for a new four-lane bridge at Mayes Canal in Mooloolaba. Admittedly, that's not a Queensland government project; that's a local government project. But, once again, it's the federal government coming to the assistance of both state and local governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        From a state perspective, there was $390 million for the duplication of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        rail. It's a $780 million project. I wonder why they call it
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Rail" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Rail
        </a>
        ? Is it because the Commonwealth owns it? No. It's because the Queensland government owns it. Yet, when we stumped up and offered to pay $390 million, what did our fearless Premier say? That's not enough money. She wanted us to pay more than 50 per cent on something that's wholly owned by the state government. There was $14.4 million in safety upgrades on Steve Irwin Way, 80 per cent of which was funded by the federal government. Steve Irwin Way is a state government road, and yet we had to pay 80 per cent. Why do you reckon that was? It's because the state government is so inept and incompetent. It just refuses to spend money on good Queenslanders and their projects, and inevitably the federal government has to come to their rescue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, there was $5 million for a network planning study in Caloundra, 100 per cent of which was funded by the federal government on a 100 per cent state road network. In the May federal budget, there was $160 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooloolah_River" rel="nofollow">
         Mooloolah River
        </a>
        interchange on phases 1 and 2. The Mooloolah River interchange is a state road, and yet we're funding it to the tune of $160 million. There was $7 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicklin_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Nicklin Way
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Third Avenue
        </a>
        connection in Caloundra. That's a local government and state road project. Once again, we're coming to the rescue of both the council and the state government. You will very rarely hear either the state government or the mayor of the local government of the Sunshine Coast Council give any appreciation for the funding that we continue to provide the local government. That's really a great shame,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jamieson" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Jamieson
        </a>
        . When we fund projects like your Mayes Canal Bridge and the Third Avenue connection, you'd expect a little bit of appreciation. From time to time, we can't fund everything you want, like the $20 million that you've been hitting me up for for the stadium. If we didn't have to keep propping up this state government, maybe we could fund $20 million for the stadium. For as long as we have to keep putting our hand in our pockets and propping up this hopeless Labor state government in Queensland, we are going to have to make certain priorities.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Dick" rel="nofollow">
         Cameron Dick

        has handed down a budget today with not one extra cent for additional road projects that haven't already been announcedâ€”not one extra cent. The people of the Sunshine Coast continue to get ripped off by this Queensland government.
