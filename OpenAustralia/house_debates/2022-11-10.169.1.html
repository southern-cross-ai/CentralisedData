        I'd like to deliver speeches written by some young people in Cowan as part of the Raise Our Voice program. The first speech is by Liora Fletcher in response to the question: what should Australia's new parliament accomplish? I am actually very honoured to deliver this speech in this place on behalf of Liora. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a 21-year-old woman, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak about topics I believe are important. Having said this, I am aware I am not the only one with visions of how I would like Australia's governing body to look and this is a very good thing. Without the diversity of voices, the new Parliament cannot be truly representative of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For this reason, it is absolutely crucial that the new Parliament enshrines the voices of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        peoples in the Constitution to enable an empowered voice in the social, economic and spiritual matters which directly affect them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Law Council of Australia describes this constitutionally enshrined voice as a manifestation of the right to self-determination, entitling people to have control over their destiny and to be treated respectfully.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This change would be a positive step towards Reconciliation, allowing a First Nations body to advise Federal Parliament on matters that disproportionately affect Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

        peoples including;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title" rel="nofollow">

        , housing, heritage protection, employment and health. It makes sense for the people who have the best understanding of the challenges facing their families and communities to have a say in how to best address these.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that we are currently facing a climate crisis and as recommended by the

        , consulting with Indigenous peoples can give rise to invaluable natural resource management strategies to mitigate climate disasters. There is no better time for cultural collaboration than now. An excellent example of this is Indigenous knowledges of cultural burn offs to prevent catastrophe during bushfire season. We have seen the consequences of not implementing these burn offs and knowledges too many times.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Parliament should take action and pass legislation to hold a referendum and change the Constitution and ensure an enshrined First Nations voice which cannot be undone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Liora. I am proud to be able to read your words in parliament and to assure you that this government takes your voice seriously and takes the measures that you've suggested seriously. We will be taking this to a referendum. Liora, I look forward to meeting you and discussing these issues further.
