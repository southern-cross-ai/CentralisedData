        About six years ago, with a group of dedicated local residents, I established the Dickson Seniors Expo. It was my pleasure again this year to invite my constituents, their friends and their families to visit the Dickson Seniors Expo 2008. The expo was officially opened by me and the Mayor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Councillor Allan Sutherland, and I am very pleased to advise that the expo, as usual, had a very successful outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year there was a range of guest speakers and presentations, including a recital by Northside Singers, a collection of men and women who are dedicated to exhibiting their talents and it was a great credit to all involved, particularly this year as the presentation they made was wonderful; a presentation by Rachael from
        <i>
         4 Ingredients
        </i>
        , Australia’s No. 1 selling cookbook; some wonderful gardening advice from Russell Young of Theo’s Nursery and

        </a>
        ; and a demonstration of exercises for seniors by Victoria Gill of Green Apple Wellness Centre. Bush poetry was a popular presentation this year, with a local known to many as ‘Long John Best’ entertaining us as well. Health presentations were also great to listen to and become involved with. This year Shay Green Podiatry and Home Assist provided some great advice. And, for the animal lovers,

        came along with a baby crocodile and a snake.

        As always, the fashion parade presented by Millers and Chaps Menswear from

        was an added attraction. Special thanks must go to Patsy Barr, Jacqui Buckland, Don Connolly,

        , Tony Pratley, Joan and Keith Penman and Gail Scott for their modelling on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the fifth year of the expo, which is an initiative of the Dickson Seniors Council held during Seniors Week to showcase local businesses and community groups. The expo is focused on areas of interest to local seniors and is a great opportunity to gather useful information and listen to informative speakers as well as a great day out. Whilst entry to the expo is free, those who attended had many chances to win some fantastic prizes and were also given free sample bags to take home. Special thanks to the Comiskey Group for their donation of a helicopter flight for two as the major door prize.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expos such as the Dickson Seniors Expo take much hard work and many months to organise, and, as is usually the case, the dedication and efforts of a small team. I would particularly like to thank the Dickson Seniors Council for their dedication and hard work to ensure that in 2008 the expo was once again the must-visit event for many of my constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thanks to the chairman, Mr Keith Thompson; the secretary, Mrs Olwyn Connolly; the treasurer, Mrs Joyce Wills; the expo coordinator, Mr Don Peverill; and committee members Mr Bert Baker, Mrs Erica Comiskey, Mrs Penny Edwards, Mr George Sands, Mrs Raelene Fittkau, Mrs Nan McQuilty, Ms Jodie Hampson and Mrs Cath Tonks. I look forward very much to working with the committee to make sure that 2009 is even bigger and better than 2008.
