        I have kept members of the House updated on the progress of the Hinkler Hall of Aviation, and finally the first sod was turned on the project a few weeks ago.

        Mark Vaile did the honours, and it was the culmination of more than 20 years work for a handful of dedicated souls—people of the calibre of Lex Rowland and the late

        , and also Bert Bent, Stan Lohse, Ray Townson and John Wientjens, who have put decades into the completion of this complex which is located in Bundaberg’s botanical gardens.

        contributed $4 million, the state contributed $2 million and the council contributed $1 million to the project. All of this money will be used to build the hall and refurbish the existing Hinkler House.

        development will comprise Hinkler’s original Southampton home, which was rescued, transported and rebuilt in 1983-84, and the Hall of Aviation, which will have a public display of memorabilia and artefacts from Bert Hinkler’s life, as well as original and replica aircraft and interactive displays.

        , the Southampton home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hall of Aviation should attract up to 34,000 people a year. To echo the sentiments of the Acting Prime Minister on the day, I am greatly heartened to see the Bundaberg community celebrating the achievements of one of its greatest sons. Too often Australians shrug off the remarkable triumphs of their citizens, so it is wonderful to see a country town elevate one of its citizens in such a public way. Bert Hinkler was Australia’s greatest solo aviator. His most important achievement was his pioneering flight from England to Australia in 1928—a 14½-day flight which excited the world and led to international air travel as we know it today. His pioneering spirit cost him his life, in Italy’s Prato Magno Alps in 1933, when he was attempting another record—but not before he had put Bundaberg on the international map.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the modern-day heroes of this story are the members of the Hinkler House Memorial Museum and Research Association, led by Lex Rowland, and the Mayor of Bundaberg, Kay McDuff, whose council had the courage to take on the project. For more than 25 years, members of this group have assiduously gathered together an incredible amount of Hinkler memorabilia, including replica aircraft, maps, furniture and personal belongings from his English home. There are 4,000 items in all—a huge aviation resource. The material will make up the bulk of the Bert Hinkler complex, and I urge any future custodians of this material to treat it with care and respect. It is part of Australia’s aviation history; in international terms it is the caveman stuff of early aviation. As such, it should be preserved and displayed.
