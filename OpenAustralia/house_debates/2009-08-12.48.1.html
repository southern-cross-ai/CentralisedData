         I thank the member for her question. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing our deep sympathy and condolences to the families of the nine Australian victims.
        </p>
        <p>
         On a number of occasions at this dispatch box, I have said that, when Australians find themselves in trouble overseas, there is often a limit to what the Australian government can do for them. On this occasion we were able, in our view, to do a lot to assist the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         search and rescue effort. Unfortunately, on this occasion it was with a terrible and tragic outcome. From the moment that we received advice of this terrible accident, our officials in Papua New Guinea at our High Commission in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
          Port Moresby
         </a>
         and our officials in our consulate division in Canberra have worked around the clock to seek to ascertain the state of circumstances in Papua New Guinea and to render as much assistance as possible to families in terrible circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have to advise the House that I have had a number of conversations in my time as foreign minister with our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          High Commissioner
         </a>
         to Papua New Guinea, Chris Moraitis, and I have had a number over the last 24 hours. It was with a very heavy heart that he advised me shortly before one o’clock that he had received information from Papua New Guinea authorities that PNG police on the ground had confirmed at about 12.30 today that there were no survivors. I indicated to the House earlier today that, when we came into receipt of further information, once the families were advised of that we would advise the House, and I was in a position shortly before question time to advise the Prime Minister of the terrible news.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our officials in Canberra have worked effectively around the clock. The head of our consular section told me he got less than an hour’s sleep last night. I spoke to him on the last occasion last night sometime after 10 and spoke to and saw him on the first occasion this morning before 6 am. That reflects the dedication of our officers in the face of these difficulties. In the face of this tragedy, I want to pay a great compliment to the high commissioner and his officers in Papua New Guinea and to the department and its consular staff in Canberra. They have now had to perform the very difficult task of advising eight families on four separate occasions of worsening news and now the worst news possible.

         just take this opportunity to thank the shadow minister for foreign affairs for her cooperation in this matter, and can I thank the House for the indulgence that they have given on more than one occasion over the last 24 hours.
