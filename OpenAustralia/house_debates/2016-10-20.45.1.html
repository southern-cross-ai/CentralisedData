       <p>
        Like the people of Chisholm, I have always been a passionate supporter of the interests of ordinary working people whilst believing there is a place for unions to properly represent members' interests. However, no-one, including me and the people of Chisholm, is immune from the corruption, thuggery, assaults, bullying, and xenophobic and sexist misconduct of union officials and leaders who partner with the opposition. I have heard stories from many people in Chisholm, in particular from small to medium-sized business owners. Once, as I was attempting to drive out of my employer's factory after attending a management meeting, some unionists who had found out about my Greek heritage and that I was part of management chased me down, threw themselves on the bonnet of my car, rocked it backwards and forwards and slammed their aggressive faces against my car window, calling me a wog and other obscenities that went to my gender.

        Restoring the rule of law and the Australian Building and Construction Commission is not just about curbing unlawful activity but about improving productivity. Housing affordability in Chisholm and the development of key facilities such as hospitals and roads are being negatively impacted by working days lost and 30 per cent increased costs. The Turnbull government is delivering for all those people who just want to get on with their jobs, create more jobs, grow our economy and, in turn, contribute to making Chisholm and Australia thrive.
