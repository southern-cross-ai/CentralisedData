       <p>
        I rise today to continue fighting a battle that the people of Canning should have already won. I'm referring to the extension of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkin_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Tonkin Highway
        </a>
        . The Tonkin Highway, as I've explained many times in this place, currently terminates in the north of my electorate at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Thomas Road
        </a>
        . It needs to be extended south through the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale and into the heart of the Peel region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our region is one of the fastest growing in Australia. We now have suburbs in what was recently farmland, and high frequency traffic on what are still country roads. The roads weren't designed for this kind of use. It's not safe, as evidenced by the tragic number of car accidents and fatalities, particularly on Thomas, Karnup and Mundijong roads. If that weren't reason enough, extending the Tonkin Highway would also fast-track local economic development. It's a critical piece of infrastructure to attract business and grow local jobs for people living in towns like Serpentine, Mundijong, Jarrahdale, Pinjarra,

        </a>
        and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've argued the case for this development many times in Canberra. The people of Canning have enthusiastically supported my efforts. They want this to happen. And earlier this year we were successful. The coalition committed $581 million for the Tonkin Highway's upgrade and extension. That would facilitate the extension of the highway south, past Mundijong Road, and connect it to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Western_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         South Western Highway
        </a>
        . The funding was announced in partnership with the McGowan Labor government in a joint media release between the Prime Minister and the Premier. We thought this was a massive win. The coalition had committed over half a billion dollars to a project that would transform our region, and it appeared to have the Labor government support. But since then, our region has had nothing but disappointment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The WA Labor government has refused to commit to the Tonkin Highway extension. In fact, during the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Range
        </a>
        by-election, where the Tonkin Highway extension was a major issue, Labor said nothing. WA Labor has let the people of the Peel region down yet again. Labor is happy to fill our region with crowded suburbs but won't invest in the sort of infrastructure needed for local jobs and the growth of real communities. When people can live and work in one place, they will put down roots and make that community their own. That's what we need in the north of Canning. An extended Tonkin Highway would improve local safety and help create the conditions for local jobs. Labor may take the Peel region for granted, but the coalition has delivered and will continue to do so. The Tonkin Highway extension is essential for the future of our region, and I will not stop fighting for it.

         If no member present objects, three-minute constituency statements may continue for a total of 60 minutes. There being no objection, I call the member for Corio.
