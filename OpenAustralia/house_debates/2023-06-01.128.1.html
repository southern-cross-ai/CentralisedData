        Poor mobile phone reception can be a significant inconvenience and safety risk for those living in certain areas of the Redlands. It makes it difficult for people to stay connected with loved ones, conduct business and even make emergency calls. This is not just an issue in the far reaches of the bay islands in my electorate; it's also experienced in many pockets of our mainland suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Official mobile coverage maps are often not accurate to the realities on the ground. In the Redlands, many known areas of poor mobile reception are not reflected in these official maps which are used to determine new network improvements. In today's digital age, having a reliable mobile phone service is not a luxury but a necessity. It should be a reasonable expectation that people living in our suburban community should be able to enjoy excellent mobile coverage. I'm determined to advocate for better mobile phone coverage across the Redlands.
       </p>
       <p>
        This month I've sought the help of local Redlanders to develop a map of local mobile reception strength. With the help of several thousand local responses to my survey, I've been able to identify specific blackspot areas and better understand the extent of the local problem. The data clearly demonstrates reception issues exist at

        , the SMBIs, Point Halloran,

        and other notable pockets throughout the city. This information will inform my efforts to work with mobile phone companies, all levels of government and other stakeholders to deliver infrastructure improvements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former federal Liberal and Nationals government funded more than 1,300 mobile base stations across Australia to improve coverage, including improvements on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Island" rel="nofollow">

        and North Stradbroke Island in my electorate. I'll be applying pressure on the new government to match this level of investment and ensure that we get our fair share for the Redlands. Of course, we don't hold much hope given that the most recent round of blackspot funding saw 74 per cent go to Labor held electorates. This is despite the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">

        holding only one-third of seats in regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to see that the Auditor-General has advised there is merit, including a potential audit topic, for round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program in their work program. I hope this audit goes ahead and some recommendations get us to a point where we can let the data and the evidence lead investment decisions rather than politics. I want to thank all the Redlanders who took the time to rate the strength of their signal through my survey. By participating in this community survey process, you have helped make a positive change in our community.
