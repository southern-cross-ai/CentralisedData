       <p>
        I rise on indulgence to acknowledge the tragic loss of lives which occurred when a vessel known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEV" rel="nofollow">
         SIEV
        </a>
        221 sunk just off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        on 15 December last year. That boat came to grief on a very rocky shoreline in very dangerous and difficult seas. Forty two people survived the wreck—41 were rescued and one man managed to swim ashore by himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 41 who were rescued were rescued because of the outstanding professionalism of our nation’s Customs and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Protection_Command" rel="nofollow">
         Border Protection Command
        </a>
        and also the courage shown by Christmas Island residents as they rallied to save lives. I pay tribute to each of them today. They responded instinctively to what is the oldest law of the sea—that is, that you have a duty to rescue those who are in peril—and they did so fearlessly. Forty one people are alive today because of their courage.
       </p>
       <p>
        At least 30 people died that morning and there are an unknown number who are missing and presumed dead. Whatever one’s views they were fellow human beings, men, women and children, whose lives were lost on our shores in a tragic accident. We acknowledge the circumstances of their passing with sadness and with respect.

         I rise to join the Prime Minister in expressing the House’s deep regret for the tragedy that took place just after dawn on 15 December when an unseaworthy boat carrying about 90 people smashed onto the rocks of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         . Islanders woke to the screams of men, women and children and, as Australians do, many of them scarpered down those cliffs to try to help. Naval and Customs personnel also put themselves at risk to save lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         Forty two people were saved, 30 bodies were recovered and we cannot be sure how many others perished. It was the wrong place, the wrong time and the wrong thing, but I suppose people cannot be faulted for thinking that Australia would be the best place for them to live. If anyone is to blame for this tragedy, it is the people smugglers. Certainly, it is not the Customs and naval personnel, who did what they could in difficult circumstances to help.
        </p>
        <p>
         This tragedy should strengthen our resolve to do whatever we can to deny the people smugglers a product to sell. We do not agree in this parliament on how to stop the boats, but we certainly do agree this is a terrible tragedy and we must do everything we can to try to avoid any repetition.
