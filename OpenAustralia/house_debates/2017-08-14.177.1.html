        Following the member for Ballarat, it would be remiss of me, as the spouse of a long-time member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bulldogs" rel="nofollow">
         Western Bulldogs
        </a>
        , not to say 'Go Doggies', this weekend as well. But this afternoon I want to talk about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Link" rel="nofollow">
         North East Link
        </a>
        , which is the missing link to connect Melbourne's freeway network between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Ring_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Metropolitan Ring Road
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Freeway
        </a>
        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EastLink" rel="nofollow">
         EastLink
        </a>
        . This is a vitally important piece of infrastructure for the constituents of Menzies. Indeed, each day, major roads such as Bulleen-Templestowe Road,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manningham_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Manningham Road
        </a>
        ;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Bridge Street
        </a>
        , Fitzsimons Lane and Warrandyte Road—particularly where those roads are major crossings of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_River" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra River
        </a>
        —are simply congested, morning and afternoon, every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        So it's pleasing that the four possible routes for the North East Link have now been released. And these four options include a link from Greensborough Road to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulleen_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Bulleen Road
        </a>
        , possible links to EastLink at Ringwood and a much longer outer ring road. Details about the possible routes can be found at northeastlink.vic.gov.au, and I note that there are a number of information sessions coming up shortly: this Thursday at the Veneto Club; Saturday at the Warrandyte Primary School; Sunday at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyule_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Banyule City Council
        </a>
        offices in Greensborough; and, on Thursday the 24th, at the Maroondah Federation Estate in Ringwood. I commend them to my constituents.

         Now we know that the Deputy Prime Minister is a bit distracted at the moment, and there are real questions over whether he is actually legitimately able to sit in this House as a member. But that doesn't forgive him for his constant attacks on Australian and Queensland coalminers living in Rockhampton and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         in the electorates of Capricornia and Dawson. Time and time again, he says that it is Labor that has let down these coalminers when it is not. It is his own government that refuses to stand with these coalminers—the coalminers of Oaky North who, again this week, have been locked out by their employer—multinational mining company Glencore—who is refusing to bargain with them. Instead, they have ordered that the workers take down 'Scabby the Rat', a blow-up protest rat.
        </p>
        <p>
         Can you believe that, rather than letting these workers come back into the mine and back to work, they have locked them out and are replacing them with labour-hire workers? This practice is happening across the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
          Bowen Basin
         </a>
         . Time and time again, directly employed workers are being replaced with labour hire. There is no job security and there are pay cuts. They are being told they are full-time equivalent, yet have no sick leave or annual leave. This is what is happening in Queensland mines, yet the government and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
          The Nationals
         </a>
         are refusing to do anything to stand up for these workers. It is wrong.
