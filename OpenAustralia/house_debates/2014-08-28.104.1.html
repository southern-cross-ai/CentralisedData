       <p>
        In the short time I have remaining, I would like to continue where I left off on the importance of having a government that invests in clean energy—that supports our community and economy transition to a cleaner and greener economy. The government's backflip on its support for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
         ARENA
        </a>
        shows the deep-seated opposition that they have towards clean energy and energy efficiency, as well as their continued denial of the effects of climate change—further evidence that the coalition said whatever they needed to say to get elected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ARENA abolition bill is part of the government's wider attack on the renewable energy industry. It also shows, as we have seen from some of the contributions in this debate from the other side, that they fail to understand this vital industry. These are the jobs not only of the future but also of today. In my area, which is a regional area, jobs are on hold in this industry—a future industry that we want to see further investment into, not less.
       </p>
       <p>
        The renewable energy industry has been devastated by uncertainty created by this government and a public scare campaign against renewable energy. We need to have clarification and confirmation that this government will actually support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RET" rel="nofollow">
         RET
        </a>
        , the Renewable Energy Target. Every other day when I have home when I am in the electorate, I talk to somebody who is actually concerned about not only what this could mean for the jobs in their area—in areas like Castlemaine and Woodend—but also concerned about what will happen to our environment. People in our country accept that climate change is real. They also accept that the government has a role to play to ensure we have the policy settings right so we can tackle the effects of climate change. Investing in renewable energy, ensuring that you have an agency to support that investment, is a piece of the puzzle.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support the second reading amendment because it clearly seeks to reaffirm this country's commitment towards renewable energy. The amendment also highlights the advice of the experts—the fact that the industry and the experts support the renewable energy agency. It also talks about the need for there to be a great deal of value for the efforts in tackling climate change and in supporting new commercial models and technology developments in reducing carbon pollution. The amendment also highlights that driving investment and reducing carbon pollution will actually help boost the government's bottom line.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we are serious about tackling climate change, if we are serious about transitioning our economy to have jobs in the future, then investing in renewable energy is the right direction to go. This government likes to talk about creating a million new jobs, yet fails to really demonstrate a jobs policy. This is one area where we can continue to create jobs, particularly in regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will finish on a little town in my electorate called Newstead. Their goal is to be 100 per cent renewable energy powered. They are ready to power themselves. They have worked out in their town a map where to place the solar panels to help power each other. All they ask is for their government to join them in that challenge—to work with them to achieve their goal. They have businesses ready to sign on and the council ready to sign on. The only players not joining this small town in their plan to become 100 per cent renewable energy powered is the state coalition government and the federal coalition government. I urge the House to support the second reading amendment because it talks about real action on climate change and the need for renewable energy.

         I rise to speak on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Repeal) Bill 2014. This bill repeals the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011. The bill also provides for the transfer of all of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">

         's existing contracts and commitments to the Commonwealth and for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Industry" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Industry
         </a>
         to assume management on the commencement of this bill. It is also anticipated that this bill will deliver savings of almost $1.3 billion, as identified in the 2014 budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         During this debate it has been very clear that the opposition simply do not get it. They are in absolute, complete denial of the budgetary mess that they have created. They still seem to believe that there is some magical money tree or some magic pudding out the back that they can just keep pulling the money from and spend, spend, spend, spend. They do not seem to understand that one person's subsidy is another person's tax increase.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just look at the mess we are in. We have to go back to the previous coalition government, who paid off $96 billion worth of Labor's debt. What is often forgotten is that along the way they paid back $50 billion in interest repayments and put $50 billion in the bank. The last Labor government to deliver a surplus was back in 1989. So anyone who is under 24 has never, ever seen a Labor government deliver a surplus in this nation. I thought it was very sad yesterday to see former Prime Minister Keating attack former Labor leader Mr Hawke. It was very sad to see such a bitter and twisted man attacking a former prime minister, especially given that former Prime Minister Hawke was actually the last Labor leader to deliver a budget surplus in this nation—albeit 24 years ago.
