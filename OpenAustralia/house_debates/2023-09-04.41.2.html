        It is Men's Shed Week, celebrating 30 years of sheds. For many Australian men, the local men's shed offers somewhere to go, something to do, and mates that make it all worthwhile. We're lucky in Casey to have 11 amazing active men's sheds. I want to pay tribute and acknowledge the men and all the volunteers that make up those sheds: Boorndawan Men's Shed in Lilydale; Morrison Men's Shed in

        I've had the chance to visit many of these amazing organisations over my time as the member for Casey, and it's wonderful to see the camaraderie and the spirit. There's one key theme that comes through, and it's the sense of being with your mates and building things to support the community. Every men's shed in Casey spends time on projects that support schools and community groups. They raise money for their own shed but also for charity. It's such an important institution, and it gives these older men something to do when they've retired. It's a big part of their life, and I'm really proud to be able to support them.
