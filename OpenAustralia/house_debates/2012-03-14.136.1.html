        I welcome the opportunity to speak about the unique suburb of Elanora within my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        and the importance of the area's local shopping centre,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pines" rel="nofollow">
         The Pines
        </a>
        Shopping Centre, or The Pines, as it is locally known. Last week on Friday, 9 March, I had the great pleasure of being part of The Pines 25th birthday celebrations. This was more than just a gathering of people acknowledging the 25th birthday of a shopping centre. It was a celebration of the longevity and success of the hub and heart of Elanora. Trading for 25 years is an important milestone for any business and especially so for a local shopping centre such as The Pines, which has truly been an integral part of the Southern Gold Coast community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pines is a unique shopping centre on the Gold Coast because, unlike other centres in the region, it is not located near the coastal strip and therefore serves predominantly the local community rather than tourists. The Pines is centrally located in Elanora surrounded by the local schools, Elanora State School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elanora_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Elanora State High School
        </a>
        ; and right next door is the retirement village, Aveo Pine Lake Village. Rather than just being a place to do your shopping, The Pines is more of a village central, providing the residents of Elanora with a place to buy their groceries, dine out for breakfast and lunch, as well as being a meeting place especially for the elderly community. This is particularly important considering that over 50 per cent of Elanora residents are considered seniors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to acknowledge several people and organisations that were in attendance at The Pines 25th birthday celebrations. There were members of The Pines senior management team: Stuart Breen,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tree" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Tree
        </a>
        and Sarah Clasen. There were representatives from the Currumbin Volunteer Marine Rescue service. I had the privilege of presenting a cheque from The Pines for $1,000 to the president of Currumbin Volunteer Marine Rescue service,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Brown
        </a>
        . The Currumbin Volunteer Marine Rescue service provides a tremendous service to the community and I congratulate them on their good work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Elanora State High School principal, Fran Jones, was also in attendance. I recently attended that school for the induction of the 2012 school leaders. I congratulate all of the year 12 students as well as the school leaders. Across the road from The Pines is the Elanora State School, which I also visited recently, firstly for the induction of their 2012 school leaders and then just the other week to present an Australian flag. Congratulations to the principal, Patricia Neate, and the deputy, Barry Love, as well as all of the staff, parents and students for their wonderful work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that so many store owners and eminent local residents were at this celebration or are closely linked to The Pines demonstrates the strong community connection that The Pines has with the Elanora community. I am proud to represent such a community-oriented suburb. I again congratulate The Pines on achieving the milestone of their 25th birthday and for the integral role that they play in the Elanora community.
