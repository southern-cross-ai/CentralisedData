        According to a survey by Travel Leaders, Australia is the world's No. 1 travel destination. So you'd think that promoting Australia to the world would be the easiest job going. But there's one chap who was sacked in 2006 by the Howard government as the head of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Tourism Australia
        </a>
        , in a unanimous decision of the board. Don't feel too sorry for him, since this chap was reportedly fired from his $350,000 job because tourism minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Bailey" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        couldn't stand his ego. He reportedly got a $300,000 payoutâ€”doing better than the 16,768 public servants who've lost their jobs since the coalition came to office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Flushed with success, the same chap ran for preselection for Cook and was eliminated in the first round, garnering just eight out of 152 votes. But the Liberal Party state executive intervened to dump the

        In parliament, he spoke about 'the values of loving kindness', but the same chap objected in 2010 when the Australian government sought to fly Madian El Ibrahimy to attend the funeral of his wife, four-year-old son and eight-month-old daughter, who had perished in the

       </p>
       <p>
        This chap's first idea as Treasurer was to increase the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        . He led the resistance against a banking royal commission, calling it a 'populist whinge' and voting against it 26 times. This chap's energy policy doesn't go any further than waving around a lump of plastic-coated coal in question time. As Treasurer, he presided over the worst wages growth in a generation and the highest debt in our nation's history while pushing $80 billion of corporate tax cuts, including $17 billion for the big banks. This chap put his arm around

        Malcolm Turnbull was a talented political orator who came to parliament after a distinguished business career and took a stand on issues he believed in. In fact, if he'd stuck to his ideals more he might still be Prime Minister. By contrast, in Prime Minister Morrison Australia has its most underwhelming leader since

        : a ruthlessly ambitious man who will do anything for power; a speaker who veers from angry rants to cliche-packed homilies; a former party apparatchik driven entirely by politics, without an ounce of original policy thinking.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's a good reason people dream about Australia. Ours is a magnificent nation. That is why we deserve so much better than a mediocrity who couldn't even keep his job promoting Australian tourism to the world.
