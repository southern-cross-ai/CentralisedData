        In 1937, as the polio pandemic took hold across the world, our isolated state of Tasmania was not immune, with the disease affecting over 2,000 adults and children across the state, resulting in 81 deaths. One bright light during this bleak time was the establishment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Giles" rel="nofollow">
         St Giles
        </a>
        , a service provider for Tasmanians living with disability and one of only a handful of disability organisations across the country that still exists 85 years later.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the height of another global health crisis, COVID-19, St Giles began to collect interviews from our Tasmanian community who are closely connected with the organisation, culminating in a wonderful exhibition at the

        with stunning photography from Scott Gelston. Face time has also been published as a book, with the interviews compiled by local writer Bridget Arkless. It is a wonderful read, telling the stories of current and former participants, staff and board members of this beloved organisation. There are many moving interviews, but I was especially struck by the interview with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Dobson" rel="nofollow">
         Arthur Dobson
        </a>
        , Life Governor Emeritus, who first came to St Giles as a child recovering from poliomyelitis in the 1950s and went on to become a board member from 1978 to 2007. Arthur tells of his time of living at St Giles as a child for around two years as his family lived on a farm in Hagley, which 70 years ago was a long way from Launceston. 'I have nothing but good memories of my time at St Giles,' Arthur said, reflecting on the strong sense of community at the time. And reflecting on the organisation today: 'St Giles still does the best that it can and in a very different climate. It still puts kids first as much as it possibly can. I have utmost respect for the organisation.'

        Though all the faces of St Giles featured in the book deserved to be highlighted individually the time constraints here make it somewhat difficult, but I'd like to give a shout-out to the wonderfully exuberant George Van Dijk, who was a participant for almost 20 years and is a wonderful addition to my office as he recently joined me as a volunteer; and to Andrew Billing, who recently stepped down as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        . Andrew, thank you for your leadership of St Giles, particularly through the pandemic. Our community is so appreciative.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be remiss of me to talk about St Giles without touching on the challenges that they're currently facing as a provider, largely due to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        funding structure. This has put immense financial pressure on them. While actively working on plans to strengthen and diversify their funding streams, they are in need of more immediate assistance. I've been working closely with interim CEO Honni Pitt to advocate for their needs. And I appreciate the time that Minister Bill Shorten has already given me as I advocate on behalf of the organisation to find a pathway forward.
