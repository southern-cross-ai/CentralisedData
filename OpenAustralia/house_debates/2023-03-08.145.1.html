        Greetings to everyone on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        . Today it is essential that we acknowledge the crucial role that women play in our society. However, despite our significant contributions, women's health and wellbeing have been neglected for far too long. Women face a unique set of health challenges in this world. From delayed diagnosis to overprescribing and dismissal of pain or other symptoms, there are unique challenges that women and girls face that lead to poorer health outcomes. On International Women's Day, we must take a moment to recognise the importance of improving this situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to focus mainly on the issue of low screening rates in my electorate of Holt when it comes to two diseases that predominantly affect women: breast cancer and cervical cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Approximately 57 Australians are diagnosed each and every day. That equates to over 20,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer each year. One woman under the age of 40 is expected to die each week from breast cancer. The statistics are a little better for cervical cancer, but that does not remove the fact that women bear the brunt of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early detection is among the best ways to avoid breast cancer or cervical cancer, and it is only possible with regular screening. Unfortunately, research by the South Eastern Melbourne Primary Health Network found that, in my electorate of Holt, only 42 per cent of women participate in regular screening for breast cancer and only 49.9 per cent undergo screening for cervical cancer. Establishing the National

        Advisory Council will go a long way in addressing the stark differences in the health outcomes for women and girls. In Australia, women fall through the cracks due to 'medical misogyny', and I'm confident that the council, chaired by the able and experienced Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, will find effective ways to address this problem. Women and girls require tailored and targeted health care that recognises and reflects their experiences and outcomes. On International Women's Day, I am proud to say that the Albanese Labor government is leading the way in making this a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Happy International Women's Day!
