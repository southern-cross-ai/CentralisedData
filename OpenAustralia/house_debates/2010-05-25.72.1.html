        I want to speak about the Centrelink jobs expo in Ipswich. The Rudd government is keeping Australia working and we are keeping Ipswich working as well. Centrelink is holding a series of job expos across Australia as part of the government’s Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. The main objective of these expos is to provide information about jobs and job pathway opportunities and to provide real jobs in areas hardest hit by the global recession. More than 300 previously unemployed people will have a job in Ipswich thanks to the Keep Australia Working jobs expo held at the showground on

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Clare" rel="nofollow">

         Bernie Ripoll
        </a>
        , and me. We congratulated all the jobseekers who found employment at the jobs expo. Unemployment in the western corridor, from South-West Brisbane through to Ipswich and the rural areas beyond, is approximately 7.2 per cent—above the national average of about 5.4 per cent. That is why the jobs expo was so important. Also, youth unemployment is 1.5 per cent higher than the national average. About 80 businesses and organisations set up stalls and there were about 500 jobs on offer.

        I congratulate the

Having a job is more than just having an income: it is about the future; it provides opportunities to participate, connect, look after yourself and achieve everything you want in life.
