        I rise today to congratulate all those who participated in Ride for Hope to raise funds to help children living in Adelaide but also living right around the globe. Ride for Hope is an initiative of Edge Church International in which participants could walk, run, cycle, motorcycle or drive along a route and raise money to help a number of organisations.

        The organisations that the fundraising went to include the Childhood Cancer Association, which provides critical emotional, practical and financial support for children living with cancer. Also, funds went to Transform Cambodia Life Centres, which aim to provide educational opportunities for children who otherwise would not have had those opportunities. Funds also went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
         World Vision
        </a>
        , which helps over 20 million people each year through relief and development.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a very successful event, and I was very privileged to be at the closing ceremony where I saw a sea of orange shirts, of people who had walked, ridden or driven, and who had, most importantly, done a lot of hard work in raising money for these important organisations. At the count on the day, people had raised $21,000—a great effort—with more money coming in. I would like to congratulate everyone involved and wish them all the best. This was the inaugural event, and it is only going to get bigger.
