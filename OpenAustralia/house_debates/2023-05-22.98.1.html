        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you would be aware that Stella Assange is in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and is, in fact, in the gallery right now. Prime Minister, why are you not meeting with Stella today? Will you meet with Stella tomorrow? And why won't you do more to see

        reunited with Stella and their young sons, Gabriel and Max?

         I thank the member for his question. Indeed, who I meet with is determined by the priorities that my office has. A priority for us isn't doing something that is a demonstration; it's actually doing something that produces an outcome. And that's my focusâ€”not grandstanding.

          If I
         </a>
         thought that that would help, then, yes, the member for Clark would have a case. But I've made it very clear to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         administration and to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         administration the Australian government's view. I appreciate the fact that that is now a bipartisan view after the comments last week of the Leader of the Opposition that enough is enough when it comes to the ongoing incarceration of Julia Assange and that nothing is served from the ongoing incarceration of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
          Julian Assange
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         What I have done is act in the most effective way possible. If having a demonstration produced an outcome, then there would be an argument. But what I have done is act diplomatically in order to maximise the opportunity that is there of breaking through on an issue which has gone on for far too long. I appreciate the member's sincerity on this issue, along with a range of other members from across the parliament who have raised this issue. As an Australian citizen, I have made representations. I will continue to do so. But this issue is not a simple one.
        </p>
        <p>
         My motivation here is not to make a judgement. People will have different judgements about the actions of Mr Assange and can still reach that conclusion of, 'Enough is enough.' But it is certainly my view that this issue does need to be resolved, and I'll continue to advocate, as I continue to advocate for Australian citizens around the world. That is the role that the Australian government has. That's the role we'll continue to have. I'm very pleased that this is now a bipartisan issue, and I acknowledge that.
