        19 February is a national day of observance because on this day 76 years ago, in 1942, mainland Australia came under attack for the first time. On this day Japanese forces mounted two air raids on Darwin that involved over 260 enemy aircraft, killing at least 252 Allied service personnel and civilians. Last Monday was 19 February and I attended ceremonies in Darwin commemorating the 76th anniversary of this really significant event for our city and for our countryâ€”when Darwin was bombed. First we met at the

        memorial and then at the Darwin cenotaph for the commemoration, including at 10 am a re-enactment of the raid complete with aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. It was a lot of excitement for the families who came along.

        Also on this morning the

        of Australia had a commemoration at Stokes Hill Wharf for those seafarers and waterside workers who were killed when bombs rained down on the wharf. This commemoration goes back to 1943, so they held their commemoration a year after the bombing and every year since.

He broke from his hunting party, approached the Japanese pilot from behind, poked him in the back with the butt of his tomahawk and said, 'Stick 'em up.' I was sitting next to the Father of the House, the member for Lingiari,

        I thank Waldo for that poem. I also want to acknowledge the fantastic commemorations that were held in Darwin last Monday. It was great to see the schoolkids there learning about this very important part of our history. Of course, we should always remember the fallen, as we do every 19 February, but we should also look after the living, so it was great to have
