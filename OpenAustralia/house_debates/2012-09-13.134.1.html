        I rise to join with my colleague the member for Hunter in expressing disgust at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government's decision to withdraw funding for education in New South Wales. I also call on the member for Paterson to join us in our campaign to see that the New South Wales government reverses its decision and actually provides resources for education in New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        The focus of the federal government, since being elected in 2007, has been on making education a priority, as Labor recognises that education is imperative and it is so important that all children can obtain a quality education. We have made an absolute commitment to making our great schools even better. The Prime Minister and the education minister commissioned the Gonski review and have committed to implementing the Gonski reforms. We are planning to build on the reforms and investments that we have made in schools with our national plan for schools. Better schools will give our children the best start in life, and that is why we want to put more teachers into the classroom, give principals more say in the way their schools are run, get better results for education and improve the information that parents get. It is all about education and making sure that we position our students so that they can enjoy a good quality of life. Education is the key to success.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is very different from the approach that the New South Wales government has adopted, and I am extremely disappointed. I hope that the state members in my area will speak out against the $1.7 billion that the Barry O'Farrell Liberal government is slashing from education. New South Wales government cuts to schools will put thousands of students at risk. This comes just after the government has confirmed its commitment to the national school plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the ground, this has a devastating impact. It is going to mean a cut of $116 million to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and 1,800 jobs will be slashed. This will also lead to an increase in TAFE fees. TAFE fees will increase by 9.5 per cent and overall there will be a three per cent cut in education funding. This is a four-year funding freeze to all government and non-government schools. It is not going to impact on one sector over the other.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first learned of these changes when the director of schools from the Catholic Schools Office on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        contacted me and said that the New South Wales government was about to announce a cut of $24.5 million to Catholic schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        What that will mean in that diocese is 20 teachers will lose their jobs, there will be approximately 10 per cent in government cuts and it will lead to a steep rise in fees and the withdrawal of advertising and funding. It will also lead to planning for a Catholic high school on the Central Coast being put on hold, and it is very much needed in the northern part of the Ryan electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a heavy blow. It was unexpected. I have been told by people involved in Catholic education that the four-year freeze will mean they will be struggling to keep pace with increased costs, but they are going to try not to pass it on to the families. There will be cutbacks in services and planning and, as I just mentioned, the Lake Munmorah High School. It will lead to a lack of support for teachers. One of the most important issues is that this will lead to students with special needs not getting the services they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are heartless cuts and they cannot be allowed to continue. It is imperative that the New South Wales government reverse its decision and recognise the fact that education is imperative for every student. Education is our future and the New South Wales government needs to knowâ€”
