        I wish to speak on something that I am profoundly concerned about and disturbed by, and that is the politicisation and corruption of the entire peer review process of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
         IPCC
        </a>
        and other organisations relating to climate change. This came to light with the release of certain emails between certain individuals concerned. I will read some of them to give you some flavour. This is regarding the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWF" rel="nofollow">
         WWF
        </a>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hi Mike. I am sure you will get some comments direct from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rae" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Rae
        </a>
        in WWF Australia, but I wanted to pass on the gist of what they have said to me so far. They are worried that this might present a slightly more conservative approach to the risks than they are hearing from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        . In particular, they would like to see the section on variability and extreme events beefed up if possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is another one, to do with some papers that were published:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The other paper by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MM" rel="nofollow">
         MM
        </a>
        is just garbage—as you know. De Freitas again. Pielke is also losing credibility as well by replying to the mad Finn as well—frequently as I see it. I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin and I will keep them out somehow—even if we have to redefine what peer review literature is!
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is another one, to do with De Freitas, the editor of
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Research" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Research
         </a>
        </i>
        , a peer-reviewed journal:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One approach is to go direct to the publishers and point out the fact that the journal is perceived as being a medium for disseminating misinformation under the guise of refereed work. I would use the word ‘perceived’ here, since whether it is true or not is what the publishers care about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is another one from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Trenberth" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Trenberth
        </a>
        on actual climate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact is, we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we cannot. The series data publishing in the August
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAMS" rel="nofollow">
         BAMS
        </a>
        09 supplement 2008 shows that there should be even more warming: but the data is surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is another one, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Jones
        </a>
        again:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So once again there is a blip in temperature that they don’t find convenient. If we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, 0.15 degrees Celsius, then this would be significant for the global mean—but we’d still have to explain the land blip.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is of grave concern. We have Dr Clive Spash with CSIRO being censored by the government. He has a paper that is critical of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
         ETS
        </a>
        . That is not being published. Are we wanting further censorship? We are getting internet censorship and indeed censorship of our own mail to our electorate.
