        <p>
         I thank the member for Pearce for the question. The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting former defence personnel, veterans and their families. In my portfolio, we are delivering targeted cost-of-living relief, including to veterans. Today, I introduced a bill that will deliver an increase to the maximum rate of rent assistance by a further 10 per cent. This is our second consecutive increase and means that, on 20 September, the maximum rate of rent assistance will have increased by 40 per cent since this government was elected. This support will help close to a million households, including 13,000 veterans and dependents.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government have also announced we will freeze social security deeming rates for a further 12 months so that part-pensioners, including 96,000 service pensioners and income recipients, can keep more of their payment. In the budget we have also announced a freeze on the price of PBS medicines for concession cardholders so that they will pay a maximum of $7.70 per script for the next five years. That will benefit—this might be of interest to those on the other side—330,000 veterans and dependants. In last year's budget, our government made a record investment in Medicare. We tripled the veterans access payment for those on a white card or a gold card, helping 290,000 veterans get better access to a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government's approach has been supporting people, including veterans, right around the country. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite. Just a few weeks ago, we had the member for Hume, who signalled that, if he was Treasurer, there would be a question around whether indexation would flow to pensioners and veterans, as he vowed to cut so-called unrestrained spending. I've got news for the member for Hume: indexation is a critical part of ensuring that pensioners' and veterans' payments keep up with the cost of living. It is insulting that he thinks this indexation is so-called discretionary spending.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know that the coalition has form. They cut pensions and payments, including veterans' payments, when this Leader of the Opposition was in the cabinet. Those opposite have done it before; they'll do it again. It is our government that stands up on the side of veterans, ensuring they get the support they need when they need it.
