        Caboolture woman Sammie Lee Milgate has been achieving success in the very competitive music industry for years. But not wanting to steal the spotlight herself, Sammie has created and runs her own small business, Live Music Promotions. It is a publicity and marketing agency for dozens of bands and music venues right across the east coast of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a very long time social stigma has led many to believe that women like Sammie just cannot do it—that they are supposed to stay at home and fall into the trap of traditional gender roles. Sammie has wrestled with this stigma throughout her professional career, but it is her success that proves not just that women can do it but they can do it really well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have good news. Sammie has been nominated as a finalist in the 2017 Australian Small Business Champion Awards, which are being held this Saturday. This is the second year in a row that Sammie has been nominated. She is just one example of the amazing work that women right across the electorate of Longman are achieving—what they are doing, the efforts they are putting in and how they are being recognised right across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge you to join with me in wishing her the best for the awards on Saturday night at the Australian Small Business Champion Awards.
