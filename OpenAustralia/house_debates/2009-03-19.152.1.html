       <p>
        Last Friday, I attended the official opening of the Hunter prostate research centre. As we all know, prostate cancer is a cancer that affects men. One in 1,000 men in their 40s will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, 12 in 1,000 in their 50s, 45 in 1,000 in their 60s, and 80 in 1,000 in their 70s. Prostate cancer is a disease that is more prevalent if one male in the family has had it. If a father has had it, his son’s chance of getting it is much greater.

        prostate research centre will provide a holistic service to sufferers of prostate cancer and, in addition, will be an excellent research base. It is supported by the

         University of Newcastle
        </a>
        and by the Hunter Medical Research Institute. I pay credit to Professor James Denham, a leading oncologist in this field, who has done a considerable amount of work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forums were held in my electorate in 2005 and last year. The Treasurer attended the first of those forums and he and Professor Denham made presentations to well over 300 men who came to the sessions. Professor Denham’s vision was for this centre to be built in the Hunter, and he was able to achieve that because of the work of a number of people in the Hunter. I would particularly like to acknowledge Geoff Fryer, a survivor of prostate cancer, who donated $1 million of his own money towards the establishment of the centre. The Minister for Defence, the member for Hunter,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">

        , is patron of the centre. On the day of the official opening, Geoff Fryer and John Sakoff cut the ribbon. Leigh Maughan, who has added an extra dimension to the centre and to the profile of prostate cancer in the Hunter, was the emcee. I congratulate everybody that was associated with the day. I know that the centre will grow and thrive.
