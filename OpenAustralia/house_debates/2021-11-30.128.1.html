        Just like last year 2021 has been incredibly tough on school students in my community on the

        . They faced an extended lockdowns in the middle of the school year because of COVID-19 which interrupted their studies and face-to-face learning. Many of them had to cope with learning from home again, not being able to see their friends, missing out on weekend sport and other activities, and not being able to celebrate milestone occasions like graduations. This has taken its toll but, just like last year, young coasties were up to the challenge. They encouraged each other and pushed through the tough times together. After everything they've been through, it's important to recognise their resilience and achievements.

        Now, as the school year draws to a close, I'd like to thank all the teachers, principals, parents and carers who have worked so hard to support our students over the past 12 months. You kept them motivated when times were tough, and you made sure they stayed on track with their learning. Our students couldn't do it without your support. On behalf of all Coasties, thank you for your efforts, and congratulations again to the recipients of this year's Dobell awards.
