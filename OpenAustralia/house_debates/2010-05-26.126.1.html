        I continue to express my concern in the public interest about the unsavoury debt recovery practices of some banks and financial lenders. It is no wonder there is a developing momentum for a class action against the price-gouging actions of financiers. My last advice was that there were 30,000 Australians signed up to that class action. But it is not just about the gouging that occurs when a borrower defaults and is faced with massive penalty interest the likes of which I have never seen before; it is about the bullying tactics undertaken by some lenders. I am keeping a league table now, covering all the major lenders, but there is one particular bank that I am declaring war on, and that is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Rural Bank
        </a>
        . It is what is left of Elders, and it is a tragedy that this bank is majority owned—60 per cent—by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        , a community bank. I have been pleading with Bendigo Bank to take some action—in its own interests, because it has a wonderful reputation and a wonderful concern for the community; it is owned by its depositors—to call the Rural Bank to order and to bring some level of accountability to bear for the thuggery and bully tactics that are being employed.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is one particular debt recovery officer I want to refer to, Malcolm Sparrow. Because I have taken a stand and stood with my constituents against the bank’s bully tactics, he has been out in my constituency bad-mouthing the member for Mallee. I can say this to Malcolm Sparrow: if he wants to pitch the integrity and the vociferous representation I provide to my constituents against his reputation, he is going to come out a very poor third last. He is no higher than the soles of my shoes. This man is a thug and a grub and the sooner he is dismissed out of that organisation the better. This man must have a very tiny mind. He is not satisfied with recommending that the bank move in with lawyers and solicitors; he wants to crush my constituents and constituents in my near neighbours’ electorates of Farrer and Barker. It is like vengeance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been calling on the Australian Bankers Association to remove this particular bank from its membership. I call on all those other responsible lenders who have behaved in a very honourable way to support my call to have the Rural Bank dismissed from the Australian Bankers Association. It does not deserve to be a member. If the other banks do not support me in this call then it will reflect very poorly on them. I again ask Bendigo Bank, which owns 60 per cent of the Rural Bank—and which has six of the 10 board members—to take some action and bring this bank to order.
