        This evening, in less than an hour, the country will tune in to cheer on the Matildas in their huge Women's World Cup round of 16 clash against Denmark. There are a few mixed feelings in Tasmania because of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Princess_Mary" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , but I'm sure we'll all get behind the Matildas. Tens of thousands are expected to fill Sydney's Olympic Park, and millions will be watching on screens worldwide.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Women's World Cup here in Australia has been a huge success already, with record figures for stadium attendances and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        audiences viewing women's sport. Stadium attendance numbers have averaged over 26,000, with over 75,000 at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Stadium Australia
        </a>
        for the Matildas opening game against Ireland. It's estimated that, over the tournament, two billion people will have tuned in worldwide, doubling the figures from 2019. I know when the bells ring to adjourn the House, many of us, particularly the assistant minister, will be racing out to find somewhere to cheer on our Matildas.

        As millions of viewers tune in, it sparks conversations about gender equality and women's representation in sport. It amplifies the voices of those advocating for equal pay, improved facilities and increased media coverage of female athletes. These conversations go further, moving into learning institutions and workplaces. When girls see women on the field in the World Cup, they know they can pursue their own dreams, and to hell with what the boys say! Encouraging young girls to pursue
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for example, helps bridge a gender gap in industries that are traditionally male dominated, fostering innovation and diversity. The fabulous STEMforGIRLS program in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helens" rel="nofollow">

       <p>
        The Women's World Cup tournament serves as an inspiration to countless young girls who dare to dream big in whatever they want to succeed in. When they see
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Foord" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Hayley Raso competing at the highest level, they see role models who exemplify resilience, dedication and the pursuit of excellence. Not only are there champions and role models on the field, but there are people off the field making a huge difference. At this World Cup, my state is represented by someone with a very important role. Tasmania's Holly-Lace Ayton is the Matildas equipment manager at the tournament. It's her job to make sure the players' kit, training gear and equipment are pristine and at the right place at the right time. She sets up and packs away training equipment and ensures it's delivered to the next location. Holly has toured the world in her role with the under-20 Young Matildas in previous years and, in between, has returned home to play for her beloved Taroona
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and coach young Tasmanian girls, empowering them to be the best they can be. I need to mention Alex Aylott and the coaches at Launceston City, in my electorate, whose passion and dedication to the kids in and around Launceston every weekend promote not only health but inclusivity, teamwork and dedication. They're training the next generation of Matildas.

        The impact of this competition echoes through other sporting codes, like Aussie rules and cricket, where professional women's teams are now a regular part of the sporting calendar. This percolates through community sport and, in just a short few years, we see the difference this makes, not only to women in sport but to children and also to men, to appreciate the fantastic role that women have in the sport. Not too many years ago, men would have been aghast at the idea of women playing full-on Aussie rules footy, but it's just what they do now. It's terrific to see.

        Last weekend, in between sitting weeks, I volunteered at the South East Suns Women's Football Club, celebrating the Indigenous round of the competition, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Norfolk" rel="nofollow">
         New Norfolk
        </a>
        Pathers junior soccer club, where hundreds of kids, boys and girls, descended on Tynwald Park in New Norfolk. Young kids are taking it for granted that boys and girls can do anything. When I was at school, girls weren't even allowed to do metalworkâ€”we've come a long way. We've still got a long way to go, but, with every kick, every tackle and every goal, the Matildas are helping lead the way. Go, Tillies! You have the nation behind you.
