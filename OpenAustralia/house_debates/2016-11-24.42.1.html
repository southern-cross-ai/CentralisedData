        This coming Saturday the community of Copacabana is invited to a morning tea at eleven o'clock at the Allagai Bay Cafe to discuss local issues and to hear updates on some major election commitments. For instance, we are installing new and upgraded
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        camera at Copa as part of the coalition government's Safer Streets program. The rollout includes cameras near the shops at Del Monte Place, two cameras at the skate park and one at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Cook" rel="nofollow">

        lookout. With the support of our hardworking local police, the community and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        , work on installing the cameras is expected to start by April next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will also talk about our $3.8 million investment to upgrade Oceano Street, which is riddled with potholes and needs fixing, and we will tackle an issue that has been brought to my attention on Facebook this week: the campaign to bring back Chantelle. It started when Nav Davis reached out to me with a story about how he and his mates at Copa made a wooden bench that they liked to sit on together and chew the fatâ€”a bench made, in his own words, 'with their blood, sweat and tears'. They called their favourite homemade bench Chantelle. But now, in news that sent shockwaves through the youth in this beachside suburb, Chantelle is believed to be missing. Police have made some inquiries on their behalf, but there are no leads at this early stage. The
        <i>
         Express Advocate
        </i>
        newspaper has now jumped on board, so if you know where Chantelle might be, come to my community morning tea and help us bring back Chantelle.
