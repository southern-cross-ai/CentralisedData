        On indulgence, I wish to inform the House that there has been a terrorist atrocity in Tunisia. There has been an attack on the national museum in Tunis in which many people have been killed or wounded, including, it seems, some 17 overseas tourists. Plainly this is a terrorist outrage. Plainly it is an attack by Islamist extremists on a fledging democracy which had thus far proven quite effective in resisting the extremism characterised by al-Qaeda and its variants and the ISIL, or Daesh, death cult in the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously the Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms this atrocity. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the dead and wounded. I regret to say that one Australian dual national is reported to be among the dead. This person cannot currently be identified but obviously our deepest sympathies and condolences go to his family and friends and his family are being rendered every possible consular assistance.

         I rise on behalf of the opposition to support the Prime Minister's words. We have been saddened this morning by reports of at least 19 people having been killed at the national museum in Tunisia and many more wounded. I am sure we all felt when we saw the footage that we were seeing evil abroad again—innocents murdered, tourists and citizens killed, and scared people seeking security. Our thoughts and sympathies are with the fledgling democracy of Tunisia and its citizens and, of course, the families and friends of those who have lost their lives, many of them international tourists. It is an act of murder designed to shake the foundations of a new democracy. But I understand that the members of the Tunisian parliament, locked down in their country's parliament building as reports of the attack broke, refused to cower in fear; instead, they sang their national anthem in defiance. Our parliament is reminded of their strength and we stand with them in democratic solidarity.

          I would like to add my own remarks and identify with those of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in that I visited Tunisia last year as the guest of their government. I was in that museum. I met with many of the new people who are forming that new democracy and their new constitution with their effort and the hopes and aspirations they have for all their people—men and women alike. I We feel for them and hope they will persist with their ideals and not be persuaded by terrorism. I think that is something we all feel.
