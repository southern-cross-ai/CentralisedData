        , when we pay our respects to current and former defence personnel, having been marked yesterday, I would like to take a moment to share the loss of one of Bonner's Bayside veterans. It is with great sadness that I share the news of the passing of former Manly-Lota

        veteran Mr Doug Jones, who died aged 87. Doug served in Vietnam and was involved in the Manly-Lota RSL for many years before becoming president in 2016. I was very honoured and humbled to not only know Doug but work alongside him to deliver funding grants and positive outcomes for the Bayside veteran community. He contributed so much to the sub-branch, and tributes have flowed in following his passing. His peers described him as an articulate person who had helped the sub-branch develop procedures for all their major commemorative events, such as Anzac Day, Remembrance Day and Vietnam Veterans Day. His legacy and contribution will be remembered during each of these services for years to come. A

        local, Doug was a well-liked member of the Bayside community and was loved and appreciated by those who worked with him at the sub-branch. Survived by his wife, three children and grandchildren, Doug will be farewelled at a private funeral today. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Doug's family. While his presence will be missed by the Bayside community, his service to our country and contribution to the Vietnam veterans community will always be remembered.
