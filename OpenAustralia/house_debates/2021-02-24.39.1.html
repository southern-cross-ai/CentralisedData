        I can't help but pull the member for Fenner up on something, and the guy has a PhD! But I just heard him say about JobKeeper that there were billions going to billionaires. I don't think that's right. I don't think those numbers are right, but anyway—he obviously didn't get a PhD in detail.

        I rise today with regard to invasive species. We had a meeting the other day on the national week of invasive species. It was great to see the work that's being done. One of the things that really interests me in my electorate is the problem of blackberries. There are a number of cultivars of blackberry and we've had a bit of success with rust, but rust only works in humid areas. Now they're developing another biocontrol—the sawfly. This is going to save so much in chemicals and labour if we can get it out there.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the peculiarities we have, though, is this sometimes inane bureaucracy. They were telling us about sawfly in the Mural Hall, but when we rang up today apparently they can't tell us about it anymore. That's always a bit of a concern! It reminds me of another issue we've sort of stalled on, and that's carp eradication with the carp herpes virus. This is incredibly important for giving our native fish a fair go. As soon as we can get that herpes virus moving, the better it will be for all fishers.
