        Who could forget the 2014 budget, when this mob on that side declared to all Australians that the age of entitlement is over? There were cuts to pensions, there was the dreaded

        tax, there were $100,000 university degrees, and the cost of medicines were going up and up and up. The

        staff to conduct meetings with the bosses at Helloworld so that they can get an inside run on a lucrative contract with that agency. And Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance and the Public Service, who's been busy for the last five years cutting hospital and school funding, has been at it as well, helping himself to a free trip to Singapore with his family—a regular guy who didn't realise that $3,000 hadn't been taken out of his business account.

Well, the age of entitlement is back on, and these chums are in it up to their necks.
