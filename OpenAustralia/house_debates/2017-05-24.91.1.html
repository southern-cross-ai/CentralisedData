       <p>
        There is some gravity attached to this issue, and I advised the Leader of the House that I wanted to raise it and the manner in which I wanted to raise it. Moments such as what we had in the parliament this morning are of great import, and the unity of the chamber is a very important part of those moments. I am quite sure you were not responsible for the organisation of the issue I am going to raise, but I simply want to draw it to your attention, as there was a ceremony in advance of the speeches here within the House, which I believe has potentially had an effect on the dignity of the House itself. I do not want to raise it in a way that causes anyone who travelled long distances to be here today to feel in any way that the moment was less than what it was.
       </p>
       <p>
        For reasons which you may be able to find out—or there may be a way for other members to bring to our attention as a result of this question—invitations to government members to that ceremony went out at around a quarter to eight in the morning, or something of that order. Invitations to the opposition, for most members of the opposition, never arrived. Given the nature of what we were dealing with this morning, I might add that that includes the member for Barton, who was not counted in the census until she was 10. She was not invited to the ceremony that was part of the lead-in to the proceedings in this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        I raise it with you not with respect to your administrative functions, because, as I understand, all the administrative roles that you play as Speaker, involving people being seated in the House and everything that you are required to do, were done exactly as is appropriate. But it is important for the country that moments like this morning can be moments of genuine unity. If there is a way, in your role of protecting the dignity of the House, to advance it so that invitations are properly given and that everybody is able to show to Australia how unified we are on these issues, I believe it is good for all involved, better for the parliament and better for the country.

         I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. Given the significance of the day, I have heard him at length. I thank him for the way in which he raised it. With respect to the arrangements, arrangements within the building lie with the event organisers. As Speaker, my role is to give various approvals. In this case they fell into three categories. One was to agree to the guests on the floor of the chamber and in the Speaker's gallery up there, which was done. The other is, whenever there is use of the private areas, to give that approval, which was given. The third is a waiving of the media rules if that request is made. That is the extent of my involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you talk about matters within the parliament, obviously within the House I have a responsibility, but when functions are happening throughout the building, as I said, it really does lie with those organising them. I appreciate the manner in which the Manager of Opposition Business has raised this, and I hope that my answers clarify that for his perspective and for all members.
