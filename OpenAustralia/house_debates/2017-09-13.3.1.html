        released the first global scientific assessment of the impact of climate change on World Heritage coral reefs;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the assessment found that it is a well established conclusion of international peer reviewed literature that limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels provides a chance of retaining coral-dominated communities for many reef locations around the globe;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the assessment also found that the GBR will start to experience severe coral bleaching twice per decade by 2035, a mere 18 years away; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) this frequency of bleaching will not allow coral reefs to recover, putting the survival of the GBR in danger along with the 64,000 jobs that are dependent on it;

        (2) welcomes the funding allocated to all successful projects under Rounds One and Two of the SCP, including the Caloundra Woodworking Club's grant of $15,000 to enable the construction of an extension to their building and the grant of $8,700 to Caloundra Surf Club which enabled the purchase of an inflatable rescue boat;
