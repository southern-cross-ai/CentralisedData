The lots that are not required for Defence will be sold to the general public, creating a mixed civilian and Defence community and reducing

        ’s net outlay.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal is part of ongoing activity to replace houses that do not satisfy the current standards for ADF housing that were introduced in 2007. Community standard housing for families is vital to the ADF in attracting and retaining skilled personnel. The site is conveniently located three kilometres from the Holsworthy Army Base and six kilometres from the Liverpool city centre. The homes constructed will deliver an excellent lifestyle opportunity for Defence families.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of the site and the construction of houses will be governed by DHA through a number of contractors, in accordance with DHA’s national specification covering performance and design requirements for DHA housing. The total out-turn cost of the proposal is estimated at $45.1 million, inclusive of

        Defence Housing Australia proposes to develop stage 1 of a 167 hectare former Department of Defence site at Muirhead, Darwin, Northern Territory. It is intended that the site be developed in stages over the next eight to 10 years. Stage 1 will develop 178 residential lots, with DHA constructing 50 houses to accommodate Defence families in Darwin. Under a memorandum of understanding between DHA and the Northern Territory government, 25 lots will be offered to the Northern Territory government to support its affordable and community housing initiatives. The remaining lots will be sold to the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed development is part of ongoing activity to replace houses that do not satisfy the current standards for Defence housing. Community standard Defence housing, as in the previous item, is vital to Defence attracting and retaining skilled personnel. DHA will develop the site as an economically viable, sustainable and affordable master planned community. Lot layout and house design will recognise Darwin’s climate and unique lifestyle, paying particular attention to minimising energy consumption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Site development and housing construction will be governed by DHA through its contractors and in accordance with DHA’s national specification covering housing performance and design. The gross outlay for stage 1 is estimated at $41.4 million, inclusive of GST, with net costs reduced through the sale of surplus lots. Subject to parliamentary approval, the stage 1 estate development works will commence in March 2011, with the construction of the 50 homes to be completed in June 2012. I commend the motion to the House.

        The Pawsey centre is crucial to the government’s strategy to address the paucity of high-ranked supercomputing systems in Australia.

       <p>
        The Pawsey centre will be specifically designed to house the petascale HPC system and provide an appropriate and secure working environment for support staff. The building, services and external infrastructure will incorporate energy conservation initiatives and comply with all relevant local, state and Commonwealth standards, codes and regulations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in late 2010 and be completed by the end of 2011, consistent with the HPC procurement, installation and commissioning program which will be completed in 2013. I commend the motion to the House.
