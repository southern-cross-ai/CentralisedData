       <p>
        Within the electorate of Cowan we are blessed with a number of seniors clubs that provide great recreation and support options for older Australians within the electorate. On 17 February I was fortunate enough to be able to attend, once again, the Girrawheen-Koondoola Senior Citizens Club located at Patrick Court in Girrawheen. I had on that occasion a chance to say thank you to the committee and the leadership of the club because they do an absolutely splendid job. There is, particularly in the lower socioeconomic suburbs, a sense of isolation. I see that the leadership and committee of the club are doing great work in encouraging more seniors to come out, interact with others their own age, work with some advocacy, get some computer training or get involved in arts, crafts, bowling, indoor carpet bowls or bingoâ€”a lot of traditional type activities for seniors. As I said before, they add great value in the community. I really do not know what we would do without them
       </p>

        It is important that I acknowledge the leadership of the club. Graham Furey

        has been a leading light at the club for a long time. He is a great bloke. He does excellent work and I appreciate the work that he has done for the locals. I would also like to thank: Bella Alphonso, Hilary Austin and Rose Barto, who are committee members; Joyce Bloomfield, who calls the bingo;

        , who works in the kitchen; Coral Fotheringham, who is on the committee and is also the coordinator of the bus; and Deanne Hetherington, who is the Secretary-Treasurer.

        is on the committee, he is a general worker and he is also a leading light within the Girradoola Lions, so I thank Les for his work in the local community. Veronica Klaver, Irene Milton, Vera Lean, Joan Nash, Rita Shepherd, Pol Situe and Alf Smallacombe are also members of the committee and represent leadership in the Girraween-Koondoola Senior Citizens Club. As I said before, particularly in suburbs like Girrawheen and Koondoola, where there is a great deal of challenge due to the lower socioeconomic circumstances of the area, it is great to have the support of organisations such as seniors clubs, particularly the Girrawheen-Koondoola Senior Citizens Club.
