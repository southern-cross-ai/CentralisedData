       <p>
        I take this opportunity to say some words of praise, respect and gratitude for the contribution June Hutchison has made to community life in Fremantle for which she received the Medal of the Order of Australia on Monday. Since moving to Freo in 1983, June has been a whole-hearted and indefatigable agent of social inclusion, social justice and progressive change. The range of her involvement in volunteering and community roles is quite incredible.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an activist, June has been an anti-nuclear campaigner and worked in support of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Aid_Abroad" rel="nofollow">
         Community Aid Abroad
        </a>
        and the Australian Conservation Council. A teacher and librarian, June also served as President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Library_Association" rel="nofollow">
         School Library Association
        </a>
        and as chair of both the Fremantle Library Advisory Committee and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Arts_Centre_Press" rel="nofollow">
         Fremantle Arts Centre Press
        </a>
        . From 1986 to 1991 June was a councillor on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
         City of Fremantle
        </a>
        , chairing the planning and development committee. In 1993 she co-founded the Fremantle community justice group and in 1996 organised the Fremantle forum on constitutional reform. In 1999 June received Fremantle's Citizen of the Year award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can tell you that at 93 June remains an active member of the Fremantle Labor branch and maintains a strong focus on issues like the fair and just treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. I cannot think of a better model of engaged and principled citizenship than June Hutchison. She has influenced and inspired the civic participation of many people in my community over a long period of time, and I'm very glad to be one of those people.
