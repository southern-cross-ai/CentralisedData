        has produced some outstanding sportspeople in the past, and it is important that we support the next crop of our local sporting talent. Unfortunately, succeeding in sport doesn't just take talent and determination; parents also often have to put their hands in their pockets to get their children to competitions.

        The Local Sporting Champions program provides financial assistance to young people to compete, coach or umpire in their chosen sport. Sport is important in the development of young people. It teaches them lifelong skills like teamwork, it keeps them fit and healthy and it allows them to excel in something they love and enjoy. I know firsthand how expensive your chosen sport can be, especially when you're competing on the state, national or international stage. These small grants make a lot of difference to the athletes and their parents.

        Sport is at the very heart of our community, impacting on our culture, society and economy. Sport has the ability to improve the health and wellbeing of all who participate, regardless of age, ability, background or gender. The benefits of sport go well beyond just health. You can't underestimate the positive impact sport has had on our culture, society and economy. Our communities are strengthened when we come together to play sport, building a sense of belonging and feeding our national identity.
