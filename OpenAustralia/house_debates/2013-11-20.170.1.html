        traces the story of two neighbours, Dougie Waters, an Aussie factory worker, and his pompous British neighbour Edward Lords, who is the boss of the local factory and nextdoor neighbour. Following a great shot by one of the Dougie's guests during a game of backyard cricket, Edward's prize cat, Dexter, falls into the roaring barbecue and is instantly incinerated, leaving only ashes. This is a movie about a tabby, not tubby—Tubby is another Wagga Wagga cricketing icon,

        The film made its world premiere on 6 November at Wagga's Forum 6 cinema, with a green carpet! All the cast, crew and more than 700 guests were there. I congratulate CrowCrow Productions. This morning I spoke to Wagga Wagga director Mark Grentell. He is very enthusiastic about the film. He said: 'We're 100 not out. We've got $100,000 so far. It's playing in all the regional theatres.'

        The film is showing at Wagga Wagga, Albury, Orange and Tamworth. It is well worth a watch. When it comes to a cinema near you this summer, go and see it; it would be unAustralian not to do so. It deserves every success. It was filmed in the Gurwood Street backyard of Mark Grentell's grandad, the late Jack Misson, who was a Wagga Wagga cricket umpiring icon, and Jack's wife, Judy. The film deserves every success.
