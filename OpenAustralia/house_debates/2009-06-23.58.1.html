       <p>
        I rise to present a petition on behalf of the residents of Coffs Coast, because there has been substantial inequity in the treatment of the victims of the storm event of 31 March. It is an issue that has touched the hearts of many residents in our region. It is an issue that prompted the local newspaper, the Coffs Coast
        <i>
         Advocate
        </i>
        , to sponsor this petition. I commend the Coffs Coast
        <i>
         Advocate
        </i>
        and their staff for the effort they have made in this regard. The Coffs Coast
        <i>
         Advocate
        </i>
        cares about the people affected by the 31 March storm event, the 6,000 people who signed this petition care about the people affected by the 31 March storm event and the Coffs Coast community cares about those people; but, sadly, our Prime Minister does not.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Prime Minister sees his way clear to promising assistance in this House—in the presence of the press gallery, in the full gaze of the national media—and delivers nothing. To our Prime Minister the plight of Coffs Coast storm victims is of no concern. He came into this House and promised them help on 25 May. He created a media opportunity, he danced in the spotlight and then he turned his back. He turned his back on many who had lost everything. He turned his back on the needy—people like 89-year-old war veteran Athol Hardie. He is a man with failing health who has lost everything. His house was destroyed and he was uninsured. The Prime Minister clearly believes that Athol Hardie is not worthy of assistance. The Prime Minister believes the countless pensioners, low-income earners and families affected by this storm are not worthy of assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, I have a message for our Prime Minister: our community thinks differently. The 6,000 Coffs Coast residents who signed this petition think differently. They think that the Coffs Coast storm victims deserve help. They deserve the help of this parliament and they deserve the support of this House. The 31 March storm event was declared a natural disaster, just like other storm events this year. Yet this Prime Minister turns his back. The muddy waters were just as destructive in March as they were in May, yet the Prime Minister turns his back. Why do you take this course, Prime Minister? Why did you mislead this House by saying that assistance to individuals would be forthcoming, when it was not?
       </p>
       <p>
        We have heard the feeble excuses of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin—firstly, that the damage was primarily to public infrastructure. I doubt that Mr Athol Hardie would agree with that: his house was destroyed; it was washed off its foundations. And, when that pathetic excuse was discredited, the minister claimed that payments would not be made because only four local government areas were affected. What is so magic about the number four? Surely it is the case that, when an area is declared a natural disaster area, it is proof positive of the impact of a storm event. This simple fact appears lost on this government. This simple fact appears lost on the minister for community services. This simple fact appears lost on our Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        This petition calls on the House to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Provide
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        , Bellingen and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambucca_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Nambucca Shire
        </a>
        residents affected by the March 31, 2009 floods the same Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment of $1000 per adult and $400 per child that has been afforded to victims of the May 2009 floods in northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        and south east Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an issue of equity—the simple principle that all Australians should be treated equally by this government, no more and no less. Six thousand Coffs Coast residents have spoken, and the Prime Minister will be held accountable for his disregard for the wellbeing of the needy in our region. It is absolutely outrageous that, by virtue of postcode, some Australians are being treated less well than others. It is a principle that is un-Australian. It is a principle that is not acceptable to the people of the Coffs Coast. It is a principle for which this Prime Minister will be held accountable. I present the petition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of frustrated residents of the Coffs Harbour, Bellingen and Nambucca Shire Councils draws to the attention of the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That individuals from the aforementioned Council areas who suffered property damage during the extensive floods in the region (March 31, 2009) have not received Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, similarly affected flood ‘victims’ from the May weather event on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Rivers
        </a>
        regions were/will be compensated following a Prime Ministerial directive made on May 25, 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The payments announced were for a one-off immediate payment of $1,000 to adults and $400 to children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While their neighbouring counterparts can access the payments having suffered the same personal disadvantages associated with a major flood, many individuals and families in the Coffs Coast region continue to struggle to make ends meet in the wake of the devastating and officially declared
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Disaster" rel="nofollow">
         Natural Disaster
        </a>
        of March 31.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The payments would go a long way toward helping recovery for those who have suffered substantial losses and should be made immediately to redress the anomaly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Provide Coffs Harbour, Bellingen and Nambucca Shire residents affected by the March 31, 2009 floods the same Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment of $1000 per adult and $400 per child that has been afforded to victims of the May 2009 floods in northern NSW and south east Queensland.
