        I rise to inform the House that the 2009-10 harvest in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        has been one of the best for many years. Following years of drought, it has come as a welcome relief and it will allow most farms to restore some balance to their operations to start the new season. It is expected that the total harvest will exceed eight million tonnes and be one of the biggest on record. While growers have been disappointed by the falling prices in the last six months or so, they still remain close to the 10-year average with most damage being inflicted by the relatively high value of the Australian dollar, in part propelled by the governmentâ€™s reckless borrowing and spending policies.

        However, as always, life is not fair to all and, although there are other pockets around the state, I am particularly concerned about the hundred or so farms on the eastern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in the Cowell, Cleve and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Arno Bay
        </a>
        districts who are still suffering from severe drought. The National Rural Advisory Council has recently visited South Australia and will shortly recommend to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Burke
        </a>
        , as to whether exceptional circumstances assistance should be continued for the many regions in the state currently declared. This will include the eastern Eyre zone which covers a much larger area than just the affected farms, and there are fears that if NRAC treat the region as a whole, they may recommend to withdraw support. Banks in the area have only been lending to some farmers on the proviso they are eligible for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC" rel="nofollow">
         EC
        </a>
        funding, and I am concerned that if the rug is pulled prematurely, banks will withdraw finance triggering lower land values with severe consequences for the local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have written to Minister Burke informing him of the situation and, in the event of NRAC recommending the end to exceptional circumstances in the eastern Eyre zone, urging him to declare a subzone for the continuation of support of these affected farmers. A number of farmers from the area have contacted me and morale is very low. I have personal experience with extended drought and the effects it has on farming communities. The reality is one of year-on-year failures, no matter what effort an individual contributes, and a sliding further into debt every year with the weight of responsibility to others hanging heavily on the individual. These are the experiences of those who live with extended and exceptional drought. I have serious concerns for the welfare and health of some. It is hard enough to endure a drought at any time. It is even more difficult when almost everywhere else is enjoying a good season. I urge the minister not to abandon these 100 farms.
