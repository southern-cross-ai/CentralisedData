         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        is the major arterial road providing north-to-south corridor access in the eastern part of my electorate of Moore. For most of its 44 kilometre length, Wanneroo Road is a dual carriageway. However, along a relatively short section between

         Joondalup Drive
        </a>
        and Menchetti Road it remains a single carriageway of rural standard. There has been a history of traffic incidents along the road over the years with incremental improvements through state and federal road funding programs. Unfortunately the most recent fatal accident occurred last weekend. Over time, the volume of traffic has increased due to growth including the number of heavy haulage transport vehicles servicing quarries and general industry. A petition signed by 466 residents was organised and presented to the

         City of Wanneroo

        calling for the road to be widened. The cost of widening the 5.4 kilometre stretch of Wanneroo Road is estimated in the order of $45 million. Mayor Tracey Roberts and councillors at the City of Wanneroo have been strong advocates for the upgrade.

        to Hester Avenue is constructed in 2017, the planned Neerabup Road exit off the freeway will be designed to directly meet the realigned Flynn Drive at a major signalised intersection on Wanneroo Road. This key intersection will form the entry to the Neerabup Industrial Area—the source of future employment and economic development. It will make practical sense to complete the extensive roadworks, including traffic signals, in a single construction phase with Wanneroo Road at dual carriageway standard as opposed to the wasteful demolition and reconstruction of the intersection at a later date.

Accordingly, federal assistance is sought towards the cost of widening Wanneroo Road between Joondalup Drive and Menchetti Road. Upgrading Wanneroo Road will directly improve road safety for my constituents in the suburbs of Carramar and

        —particularly at the Golf Links Drive intersection. The upgrade will also ease congestion by removing the need for traffic travelling along Wanneroo Road to merge from the existing dual carriageway into a single lane north of the intersection of Joondalup Drive. By having a continuous dual carriageway along Wanneroo Road to Hester Avenue, residents of the—
