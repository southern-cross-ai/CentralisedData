        I inform the Chamber that my electorate office has this week relocated to new premises at 129
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Boulevard" rel="nofollow">
         Grand Boulevard
        </a>
        , Joondalup. The lease over the old office had expired and, after some 22 years, the premises were in need of maintenance due to water leaks. There was also a requirement to comply with contemporary building codes currently in force to provide disability access to all constituents and to comply with upgraded security protocols. My dedicated team of staff and I look forward to continuing to serve our constituents and the community from our new office, which is in a more central and accessible location within the civic precinct of the Joondalup CBD, with good access to public transport and car-parking facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking forward, major infrastructure priorities for the electors of Moore include widening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">

        between

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodges_Drive" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the extension of it north from Hester Avenue to Romeo Road in Alkimos. East-west traffic connectivity is set to improve from next year through the construction of bridges over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        to permit the free flow of traffic at the congested intersections with

        . In addition, the provision of federal road funding to the city of Joondalup will improve road safety at a number of busy intersections along

         Marmion Avenue
        </a>
        . The federal government has delivered $8.99 million in road funding to the city of Joondalup under the Roads to Recovery program. In addition, under

        funding, $1.44 million has been allocated to improve road safety at 10 of the most dangerous locations in the Moore electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to be a member of the federal government which has delivered $5.5 million in financial assistance grants to the city of Joondalup in the current year to ensure the delivery of essential services for local residents. There are a number of local community projects which I actively support in conjunction with local government. To mention a few, they include the extension of the clubrooms of the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club, the provision of a sheltered bowling green at the Sorrento Bowls Club, the installation of closed-circuit television security cameras at Hillarys marina, an upgrade to lighting and facilities for the Whitford Amateur Football Club at MacDonald Reserve, the construction of a dual-use coastal pathway connecting

       </p>

        May I take this opportunity to thank all the staff in
