        I move:

          Public Works
         </a>
         Committee Act 1969
        </i>
        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR" rel="nofollow">
         AIR
        </a>
        6000 Phase 2A/B new Air Combat Capability Facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        proposes to carry out public works to support the introduction into service and operations of the new F35A, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Strike_Fighter" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Strike Fighter
        </a>
        , aircraft. The works will provide new and refurbished facilities at Royal Australian Air Force Bases Williamtown, Tyndal, Townsville, Darwin, Curtin, Scherger, Learmonth, Pearce and Edinburgh as well as additional explosive ordnance and flare storage facilities at Defence Establishment Myambat. The works will provide new and upgraded facilities and infrastructure essential to the operation of the new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The project includes new accommodation, maintenance hangars, storage, workshop and training facilities, aircraft runway and pavement works, and explosive ordnance storage facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $1.477 billion, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . This investment will bring economic benefits for the local industry, predominantly in the regions of Newcastle, in

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , over the next seven years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee made three recommendations to Defence in relation to the works proposed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Williamtown, and I am advised that Defence has accepted these recommendations. Specifically, Defence will: continue to consult with local communities and, where possible, implement measures for the mitigation of noise impacts; work with the Hunter Water Corporation to ensure water quality is not compromised; and undertake appropriate traffic studies to ensure that construction traffic is suitably managed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence in early 2015 and be completed by 2022. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee, under the leadership of the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for once again undertaking a rigorous and timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
