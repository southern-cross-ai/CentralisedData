        Recently, I had the opportunity to launch the Gippsland Tourism Conference, which is an important event that provided local tourism industry operators with insights into the industry. I told the gathering at that time that I am tired of hearing about the potential for the Gippsland tourism industry, and that it is time for us to deliver on that potential that has been talked about for the best part of 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism is an important industry to the Gippsland region. It generates about $840 million in direct economic benefits for the Gippsland community by attracting 1.7 million overnight domestic visitors and about 61,000 international visitors. In addition to that there are 2.9 million day-trip visitors, which adds up to a tourism industry creating 4,850 full-time jobs and supporting over 1,300 businesses. But I believe we can do so much better.
       </p>
       <p>
        The broader Gippsland region—and I am including the neighbouring electorates of

        and, to some extent, Flinders—has some of the most extraordinary natural assets in Australia, but it remains largely undiscovered. I know the member beside me was in the Gippsland region over the weekend and discovered the Wild Dog Winery among many great attractions in the Gippsland region. There is no other region in Australia that can boast the diversity of natural attractions that are on offer in Gippsland, from the magnificent

        and a network of rivers and streams that are the envy of all other places, as well as our beautiful country towns and coastal villages.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to get better at selling the message that Gippsland has it all, Gippsland is open for business and there are some very good reasons to take a break in our own backyard. This week I have initiated a campaign to encourage Gippslanders to explore our own region in the coming September school holiday period. The message is very simple: we have an extraordinary region just waiting for you to explore, and when you take a break in Gippsland you are helping to create jobs in our region. I am also launching a photography competition where I am asking people to send in their favourite scenes of Gippsland, and the best 12 shots will feature in a 2013 calendar that my office is preparing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure we are all aware on both sides of the House that the tourism industry is facing enormous challenges, with stiff competition from cheap overseas destinations and the high Australian dollar making it easier for Australians to travel internationally. But I believe there is a role for governments at all levels to spend more of the marketing budget on promoting regional destinations with a message to see Australia first. I believe there is a need for more support for regional festivals and events to overcome the current city-centric focus of governments. We need to get better at helping the industry to attract and retain skilled workers and to support new investment in infrastructure, particularly on public land, that will encourage Australians to explore our regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Gippsland we have extraordinary natural attractions, but much of our infrastructure in our national parks, along our foreshores and in other reserves needs to be overhauled. Governments also have a key role in assisting regions which have been affected by natural disasters when brand damage occurs through fires, floods and cyclones. I believe there is a need for a regional tourism disaster fund to help these regions get back on their feet. I encourage all Australians to see Australia first in the upcoming school holiday period.
