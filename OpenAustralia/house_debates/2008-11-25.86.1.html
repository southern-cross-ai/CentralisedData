        The Greenbank RSL is the third biggest sub-branch in Queensland, with more than 1,400 members from all branches of the armed forces. It continues to support the local community generously. Some of its support this year has included $35,000 for the Breast Cancer Association of Queensland, $25,000 for the

        At the dinner, Mr McHugh explained how there has been an increase in young people becoming involved in RSLs, with the Girl in a Million contest attracting wide support from the community, as it would. I commend all the contestants in the Girl in a Million contest because they do a lot of marvellous charitable fundraising.

        We all notice that the crowds at Anzac Day services and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">

        services are getting bigger every year. As time marches on, there is even more enthusiasm, more sense of the debt that we owe to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. The RSL is focusing its support on the welfare of its members, as it should. I commend the wonderful work of the Greenbank RSL sub-branch and quote the league’s ode:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the going down of the sun and in the morning
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will remember them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lest we forget.
       </p>
