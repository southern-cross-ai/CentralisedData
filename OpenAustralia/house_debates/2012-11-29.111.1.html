        REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new legislation for the chemical regulator has ignored stakeholder concerns and will massively increase regulation, increase the cost of chemical registration by one third or around $8 m, and add another layer of red tape. This is despite the Minister for Finance and Deregulation listing Agvet chemical reform in the 2012 update on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        deregulation agenda as a key example that will reduce regulatory compliance costs for business and improve their competitiveness.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reform process was supposed to address two key areas; the cumbersome assessment and registration process to make it more cost efficient for business and to provide industry with timely access to the best and safest crop and animal protectants; and slowness of review of chemicals identified with potential environmental and safety hazards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However the new legislation instead focuses on adding another layer of red tape with an automatic 7-15 year review process. Despite the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
         RIS
        </a>
        for the Agvet reform stating that it is envisaged that the numbers of chemicals referred for review broadly equate to the existing numbers of review nominations.
