       <p>
        Today I would like to take this opportunity to speak about a special initiative that has been launched in my electorate called Macarthur Acts of Kindness. Inspired by the stories of kind Macarthur residents that I hear on a daily basis, this initiative celebrates those people who have gone out of their way to assist a friend, neighbour or stranger in the local community. Acts of kindness come in many forms and are one of the greatest gifts that we can give someone else, especially without expecting anything in return.
       </p>
       <p>
        Macarthur Acts of Kindness is an important initiative because it gives everyone in our community a chance to thank someone who has performed a selfless act of kindness towards them and it lets people know that the little things do count. Each month those nominated received a surprise certificate in the mail thanking them for their act of kindness and they are invited to my office for a special afternoon tea so I can thank them for making the Macarthur community such a fantastic place to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program was launched last week and already four local people have been nominated for their kindnessâ€”Melissa Schriever, Jodie Stephens-Fripp, and Mark and Jean Holyoake. Not only have these members of my community been kind to those around them, but they have also set a good example, inspiring others to practise kindness and pass it on. Whether it be an individual helping a stranger to cross the street or making a meal for their neighbour when they were not feeling well, in my opinion it is often these small acts of kindness that have the biggest impact on making a positive difference in the lives of other people. I am proud to stand in parliament today and acknowledge these Macarthur residents for their acts of kindness because every act makes a difference and helps make Sydney's Macarthur region such an amazing place to live.
