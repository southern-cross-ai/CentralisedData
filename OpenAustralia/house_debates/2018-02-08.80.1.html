        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister today commit to renewing, in full, the National Partnership on Remote Housing which expires in June this year, or is the Prime Minister preparing to give up on this critical part of the Closing the Gap framework?

          I thank the member for her question. As I indicated yesterday, the focus on remote housing remains a strong feature of the work that we're doing to close the gap. It has resulted in over 400 local Indigenous jobs being created and 92 apprentices, so it is adding to the growth in both housing and employment opportunities. There are 1,150 new homes and 1,500 refurbishments—

              The reduction in the number of homeless people now in Aboriginal communities is far better than what it was. This government will leave with a legacy that housing has been a strong feature of our Closing the Gap strategy.
             </p>
             <p>
              The negotiations that we will continue to have with state and territory governments on this are important because Aboriginal and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
               Torres Strait Islander
              </a>
              people are citizens of each state and territory jurisdiction and must be accorded the same consideration as the general population in terms of the housing bilateral agreements that exist between the Commonwealth and the state and territory jurisdictions. They have to be considered in that context, because what we tend to do is set up separate programs that become the feature and focus of access to infrastructure and housing. This takes this beyond that. This is about Indigenous leaders having raised the issue of the contribution of both the Commonwealth and the states and territories to their living standards, to their way of life and to the equality they seek in every aspect of what they hope to be their journey within our country.
             </p>
             <p>
              We will not resile from our commitment to housing in remote communities and we will continue to plan, develop and implement the programs that are needed to effect that—and that includes creating jobs for young people, which is what I started with. That is an important economic driver that will give them the wealth and social capital to make a difference to their own lives and not rely on welfare.

               This is the first time I'm in danger of being boring! My question is to the Prime Minister. The National Partnership on Remote Housing is already terminating now. Queensland, over the 10 years, gave $660 million and Canberra $1,100 million. The LGAQ says there have been 400 jobs and apprenticeships and 1,500 new houses. Occupancy rates are still, abysmally, around 15 people per house. The Rudd-Abbott legacy was 1,500 homes. What do you want to be yours, Prime Minister?

                I thank the honourable member for the question. Of course, the subject matter is the same as that of the question asked by the member for Herbert, so I refer the honourable member to the minister's answer. I just confirm that we are negotiating a new agreement for remote housing with the jurisdictions who remain part of the terminating program. It is very important. As the honourable member knows, as a former minister in Queensland, housing is a core state responsibility, and it is very important that, in any new arrangements, the states step up to their responsibility. I hope the honourable member is not disagreeing with me, because housing is a core state responsibility, so that renewed agreement is under discussion and negotiation by the minister, ably assisted by the minister who answered the previous question.
