        Today marks National Meals on Wheels Day, and this year it recognises the dedicated volunteer workforce who stepped up to help protect the health and wellbeing of vulnerable Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past couple of months I've had the opportunity to volunteer my time to assist the Wynnum and Manly District and Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels and meet some of the amazing volunteers. As recently as last week, I joined Janet Wishart to deliver hot meals to the Mansfield community.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the peak of the pandemic, the Morrison government stepped up to ensure our Meals on Wheels services had the additional funding they needed to meet the increased demand for their services. Meals on Wheels and similar services were reinforced with a $59.3 million injection to ensure more prepared meals, food staples and essential daily items could be delivered to those who needed it most.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently received a kind note from Ken at Wynnum and Manly District Meals on Wheels, regarding this funding. He said, 'When all hell broke loose, we had to find additional resources to implement a COVID-safe plan, cover additional cleaning costs and print off communication and instructions for clients and volunteers.' Ken said, 'We would not have achieved this without the additional $35,000 funding, and we give thanks for that.' Ken, you are welcome, and thank you for sharing this positive storyâ€”
