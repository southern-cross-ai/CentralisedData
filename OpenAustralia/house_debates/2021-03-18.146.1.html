        It's a tremendous honour to be nominated for an Australia Day award and an even greater honour to be a recipient of one. On behalf of our community, I'd like to place on the record the thanks of the Australian parliament to these wonderful community members who are making a real difference to the lives of so many in the Calare electorate. Congratulations to all of these wonderful members. In a future speech to this place, I will be honouring even more members of our community who were honoured on Australia Day.
