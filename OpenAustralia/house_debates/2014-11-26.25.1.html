        In the first instance, Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing the debate to be suspended for a few moments while the opposition conducted some quick checks. I note that the need for those to be conducted was due to an administrative error at the opposition end and that you, Madam Speaker, followed the necessary protocols in terms of making information available to the opposition. Having now had a chance personally to go through the bill, I can say that it is completely consistent with the oral briefings which had been given. It makes sense for the running of the parliament and particularly for the responsibility that you as one of the Presiding Officers have with respect to the security of parliament itself and for the expertise that is able to be added by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        . The opposition is happy to support the bill and to see its quick progress through all stages.

         On behalf of the government can I say that the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2014 makes an important change to ensure there is adequate security of

         representative, maybe a member of the board. The board provides advice, as required, to the Presiding Officers on security policy and the management of security measures for Parliament House. It is an important change and will ensure the best advice is provided to the Presiding Officers to ensure the security of the House and all who work and visit here. I want to commend both you and the

          I would like to thank all members from all sides of the House—and that includes the crossbenchers, as well as the government and the opposition—for their cooperation in the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2014. The security and safety of the occupants of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
           Parliament House
          </a>
          is my primary concern as Speaker. I believe the arrangements we have made to secure Parliament House in response to the latest lifting of the national security alert level will provide additional assurance to building occupants and visitors.

         <p>
          The presence of the

          , formerly a member of the Security Management Board, is an important part of the changes we are looking to make. I commend the bill to the House.
