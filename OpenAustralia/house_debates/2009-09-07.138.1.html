       <p>
        In the past I have spoken on many occasions about the suburb of Girrawheen in the south of Cowan. It is without doubt an area of unfulfilled potential, but it is challenged by lower socioeconomic circumstances. In moving around Cowan I have found there is generally a feeling of optimism for the future, and in most places retail sales remain strong. However, not everyone is doing well and today I will mention a group of people I recently met who work hard to help those who are struggling to put food on the table. I was recently driving through Girrawheen and stopped to visit the Northway Christian Centre.

        The Northway Christian Centre is under the leadership of senior pastors John and Julia Warwick. However, I would specifically like to mention their ‘Jesus Bread’ ministry, which involves the distribution of food to local less fortunate people. On the day of my visit I saw a line of people receiving a box of nutritious food and they were grateful for that food. Con Opranesu and Kevin McAloon explained to me how the ministry works and I saw the volunteers hard at work providing for the needs of the community. Included amongst those volunteers were Allan McFadyen, Marjorie McFadyen, Aneta Opranescu, Dannielle Gardener, Carmen Savencu,

        and Michael Mulligan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand some of the volunteers have themselves turned from their own paths of self-destruction, leaving alcoholism and other challenges well behind them, yet they now serve God and show his love to the people of Girrawheen. I wish them well in the work they do and I appreciate their efforts, as I am sure do those who have need of the ‘Jesus Bread’ ministry.
