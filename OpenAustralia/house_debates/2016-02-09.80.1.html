        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Minister, the National Stronger Regions Fund is very important to regions such as mine. I have had many inquiries from people in my community about the next round of this fund. Could you please update the House on the timetable for the next round and explain how this program is delivering local jobs to regions like mine.

         I thank the honourable member for Page for the question. It was a pleasure to be with him in his electorate to look at some of the projects that are happening and that he has been supporting for a very long period of time. I particularly note the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Highway
         </a>
         work that has at last come to Page—the biggest project in fact on the whole of the Pacific Highway, a 155-kilometre contract, headquartered in Grafton in his electorate, which will provide thousands of jobs to the people of Page. It is certainly a pleasure for us as a government to be engaged in such significant construction projects in regional communities. That was of course a neglected part of the Pacific Highway under the previous government. We are filling in the gaps, and that is particularly important to the local people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another way in which we have been able to assist regional communities, particularly regional communities that are suffering disadvantage, has been through the National Stronger Regions Program. I know that the honourable member's electorate missed out in the first round, but in the second round there were four projects approved, and they are a demonstration of the innovative kinds of activities that are being undertaken in many communities to help create jobs and build a stronger local economy. The redevelopment of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Rivers
         </a>
         Livestock Exchange in Casino, the new sugar freight and logistics project at the Harwood sugar mill, the reconstruction of the Ballina marine tower, and the Lismore quadrangle in the new Northern Rivers regional gallery are examples of the breadth of projects that have been funded under the National Stronger Regions Program right around the nation. Indeed, in the first two rounds, 162 projects have been funded, and they are already delivering jobs and opportunities in regional communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third round of the National Stronger Regions Fund opened on 15 January and closes on 15 March. I would encourage communities, particularly those who are suffering disadvantage, who have an idea about what they can do to create jobs and boost their local economy, to apply, to take advantage of this program and to work with their regional development authority to develop applications that are likely to make a real difference to their communities. We care about those communities. We want the people who live in disadvantaged areas to share in our nation's growth and prosperity, and this National Stronger Regions Fund is one way in which we are demonstrating that real concern.

            For the benefit of the member for Isaacs and others, the conclusion of question time is entirely within the hands of the Prime Minister. I just do not want the member for Isaacs to think I am not recognising the speed with which he gets to the dispatch box—even if he demonstrates the speed in getting to the dispatch box that the member for Sturt once did in leaving the chamber! And, even if he gets his question out, it is entirely within the Prime Minister's domain to bring question time to a conclusion.
