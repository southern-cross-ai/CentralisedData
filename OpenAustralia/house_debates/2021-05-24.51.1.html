        Today I want to talk about something that isn't talked about in this House very much, and that's a little bit of romance. Just in the last week, Tripadvisor have announced the world's most romantic hotel was none other than the Narrows Escape in my great electorate of Fisher. I want to send a huge shout out to Ali Kahn and his wife, Xochi Lindholm, who have recently bought the Narrows Escape, which is an absolutely fantastic hotel—the world's most romantic hotel.

        I visited there recently, and I can tell you I know why it won this award. I was swept away. It's an absolutely amazing place with six cabins with spa baths and forest views, and you can hear the creek running through—absolutely fantastic. I encourage everybody watching this to book in now, but you had better get in quick because it's near 100 per cent occupancy.

        This week I also visited the Maleny Neighbourhood Centre for their Speak Up Now candlelight ceremony against domestic violence. This was a great night. It was very sad to have to have it, but it was a terrific night attended by many people in our community. It was a great show of support for those who suffer from domestic violence. With
