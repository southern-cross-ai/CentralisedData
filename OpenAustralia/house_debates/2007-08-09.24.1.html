        Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Hardened and Networked Army (

        ) facilities at Edinburgh Defence Precinct,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The hardened and networked Army initiative, which was approved by the government in December 2005, greatly strengthens the Army’s protection, mobility, firepower and communications, allowing operations in more complex, dangerous and uncertain environments. I was certainly pleased to attend the parade at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Robertson Barracks
        </a>
        a few weeks ago when the new Abrams tanks replaced the old tanks in the Army’s order of battle. This initiative will increase the government’s options in both the combat weight of the force that can be deployed and the duration that forces can be sustained on operations. As part of this initiative, the 7th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment is being reraised as a mechanised infantry battalion to be based at Edinburgh Defence Precinct, Adelaide, along with supporting artillery, combat engineering and logistics troops.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hardened and networked Army facilities project at the Edinburgh Defence Precinct will be delivered at an estimated out-turn cost of $623.68 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It will provide working accommodation, training facilities, urban warfare training facilities, a driver training area, a vehicle wash point and common user facilities for the Army and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , including medical, fitness and community facilities and infrastructure works. This will be a huge boost for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . The project will deliver a high-priority defence capability requirement. It will also deliver economic benefits for South Australia and provide a popular posting location for Army personnel. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence later next year and to be completed progressively between December 2010 and December 2011 to enable occupation from January 2011. I commend the motion to the House.
