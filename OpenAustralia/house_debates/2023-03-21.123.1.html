        This Saturday
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        has a chance to vote for a fresh start by electing a Minns Labor government. After 12 long years, four Liberal premiers, endless corruption scandals and political infighting it's time for a fresh start in New South Wales. Chris Minns and his Labor team are offering that fresh start.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have the honour of representing the federal electorate of Barton, and I work closely with all my outstanding state colleagues: the future Premier, Chris Minns in Kogarah; Steve Kamper in Rockdale;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Cotsis" rel="nofollow">

        in Canterbury; and Jo Haylen in

        </a>
        . I have known Chris and his wife, Anna, and their three wonderful boys for a number of years. I have great confidence that he will be a strong and a very good premier, a premier who listens and who acts. He will act by delivering on his Fresh Start Plan for New South Wales, including restoring a world-class education system with more investment in preschools, schools and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; repairing and rebuilding our health system after 12 years of neglect; introducing nurse-to-patient ratios; backing local manufacturing by building the Tangara replacement trains at home; a plan for cost-of-living relief, with a $60 weekly cap on road tolls; a plan to create a New South Wales energy security corporation, a state owned body that will accelerate investment in renewables and deliver cheaper and more reliable energy; and ending privatisation of state owned assets.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Minns government will abolish stamp duty on properties worth up to $800,000 for first home buyers, introduce a conditional rate for first home buyers purchasing homes worth up to $1 million and appoint a rental commissioner to make our state a fairer place to rent. This is what a fresh start for New South Wales looks like, and I urge the people across our great state to elect a Minns Labor government this Saturday. I will be handing out on Saturday with the colleagues I referred to. I am very confident that the Minns team will do extremely well this coming Saturday in New South Wales.
