       <p>
        I'm very pleased to rise to draw attention to several valuable organisations in my electorate of Bradfield which received grants under round 7 of the Stronger Communities Program. I'm very pleased that we've seen grants awarded to a broad cross-section of organisations, from education centres to sporting clubs and emergency services. Many of these organisations are well known to me. I've had the chance to visit them and see the great work that they do. I'm really pleased that these grants will support that work.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Ives" rel="nofollow">
         St Ives
        </a>
        Preschool Kindergarten has been operating for over 60 years. Thanks to round 7 of the Stronger Communities Program, it is now able to purchase new learning support technology to provide even better services to the very small children it cares for and to help them get their start in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another grant recipient is the Ku-ring-gai
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philharmonic_Orchestra" rel="nofollow">
         Philharmonic Orchestra
        </a>
        —and, parenthetically, I congratulate them on a wonderful performance on Sunday afternoon; Ravel's 'Bolero' and a number of other items were on the schedule—and they've been putting on great local performances since 1972. The orchestra has received funding under round 7 of the Stronger Communities Program to develop a streaming capability building project, and I know how important that is to arts organisations of all sizes, whether professional or community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hornsby Connect is a very meaningful volunteer-driven community organisation that provides support to those in need. Hornsby Connect has received funding under round 7 of the Stronger Communities Program to develop a covered outdoor eating area which will assist them in providing hot lunches in all weather as part of their food pantry service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other local volunteer organisations that have been supported include the local police citizens youth club, who will be able to install air conditioning in their boxing room; and Street Work, which is purchasing new laptops to help young people stay connected.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         The Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Wahroonga, St John's Asquith, Christ Church St Ives and Scout groups in Gordon and St Ives are all now able to upgrade their facilities to continue providing important services to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, there has been funding for local sporting organisations, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lindfield" rel="nofollow">
         West Lindfield
        </a>
        sport and recreation club, which has received a grant to develop new spectator seating; and Ku-ring-gai
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Athletics" rel="nofollow">
         Little Athletics
        </a>
        , who are now able to purchase a new awning for their shed. Local emergency services have also benefited, including our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">
         RFS
        </a>
        brigade, which has received a grant towards their fire station fit-out; and our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        , which has received funding to create additional spaces for training and meals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to seeing each of these organisations complete their projects over the coming months, and to seeing our local communities in Bradfield enriched as a consequence of these various worthwhile projects. I congratulate all of the recipients on the hard work they've done in developing these projects and the funding they themselves are contributing. This will be a good outcome for our community.
