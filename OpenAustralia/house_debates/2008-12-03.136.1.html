        I rise to talk about the Como Golf Academy at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Como Secondary College
        </a>
        in my electorate of Swan. The Como Golf Academy provides both a comprehensive academic program and a golf program of the highest quality. The school recently held their annual golf day in November at Collier Park Golf Course as a fundraiser to support the school program. I attended the day in support of this fantastic program and saw many local businesses and individuals turn out on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The college is conveniently located adjacent to the Collier Park public golf course, and the academy is dedicated to producing golfers who are highly skilled and possess a strong academic background. For the students of the academy, golf is the central option of study and is successfully incorporated into their mainstream school program throughout their secondary education. This combination allows them to subsequently pursue either a rewarding golf career or careers in recreational or physical education studies at university level. Furthermore, Como Golf Academy students are trained to develop their physical and mental strengths to advance their competitive ability and course management skills. They develop understandings which equip them to actively participate in the global golfing business communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students of the academy have full use of the vast resources in the picturesque environment of the Collier Park public golf course, where a special par-3 hole has been designated for the use of the Como Golf Academy. The students also have free access to the Collier Park driving range, practice bunkers and practice putting greens. I must congratulate Ross Metherell, the professional at the Collier Park course, for his support of this program and for making Collier Park available to this centre of excellence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The specially selected students of the academy are taught the theoretical and practical components as part of the regular school program. These types of programs that are provided further to the curriculum are run by people committed to the students who participate in these special programs. The person who I must recognise is Mrs Ros Fisher, who holds nationally recognised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Sport" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        golf-coaching qualifications. Mrs Fisher is also a qualified high-school teacher with extensive domestic and international coaching and playing experience. I worked firsthand with Ros whilst I was on the junior committee at Royal Perth Golf Club, and the dedication and passion Ros displays are fantastic. I would also acknowledge the great support the Royal Perth Golf Club has given this program. Ros spends a period of years with the students in this program as they progress through it, and at the graduation ceremonies I attend I can see an almost parental love and an enormous amount of passion when she talks about her students in this program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Como Secondary College engages the extensive expertise of the Collier Park golf professionals to ensure the highest level of coaching professionalism in the state is available to our golf academy students. In its brief history the academy has won a number of state, national and international titles and in 2001 Como Secondary College was the home of the world junior golf champion,

        . The academy continues to be the home of many state junior and senior representatives. Past students of the golf academy are now members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

        status. I applaud the program and congratulate all those associated with it, including the parents who have the vision to allow their children to enrol in this type of program.
