       <p>
        On Friday, 5 May this year I had the great pleasure of attending the closing night of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Festival
        </a>
        of Sydney, at The Grand Roxy, Brighton-Le-Sands. Over a month earlier I had attended the opening night. This fantastic event is in its 34th year of celebrating the incredible contribution the Greek community and Greek culture have made to Australia, and, of course, in the electorate of Barton. For those of us who live in Barton there is no question about the importance of the Greek-Australian community. Most of the Greek community lives in Earlwood and Brighton-Le-Sands.
       </p>
       <p>
        This event is a highlight in our calendar in Sydney thanks to the incredible energy and dedication of its organisersâ€”people like Nia Karteris, who has spent over 15 years working for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox
        </a>
        community and the Greek community more broadly. It is also thanks to Harry Danalis, and his council, at the Federation of the Greek Orthodox Communities of Australia, who have worked tirelessly for the community for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Greek Festival of Sydney offers an opportunity for people to experience some of the culture of Greece, its history, its connections and its language. The volunteerism of this community festival is just extraordinary. But it is also an opportunity for us to reflect on the richness this culture bestows on us. It is a reminder of how much less vibrant our suburbs, towns and cities would be without the Greek community. The festival gets bigger and bigger every year. I congratulate the Greek community in Barton and across the country and thank them for their work.
