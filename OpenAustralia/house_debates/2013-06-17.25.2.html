        by leaveâ€”I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        and Zambia in April 2013, and seek leave to make some very brief comments.

        Leave granted.

        This was a fairly arduous delegation visit over a short period, thankfully, with only three members of the delegation. There was a lot of hard work and we had to share the same load between three instead of the normal number of five people. I would hope that having three members of a delegation is not the norm for future delegations. I thank the secretariat.

        did a brilliant job, particularly considering that that was the first delegation visit that he had been part of.

        As noted in the report, the delegation members worked well as a team. In the past I have been somewhat critical of some of the AusAID projects that I have seen while on delegation visits, but I would have to say that, from the projects we saw during this visit, which are noted in the report, I thought AusAID money was being spent very well. So I congratulate those involved in making sure that that money was spent wisely. I think Australia can be proud of the work they are doing both in South Africa and in Zambia.
