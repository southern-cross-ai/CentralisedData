       <p>
        I rise to report to the House on the 10th running of the San Run for Life held on Sunday, 17 October. The first thing I want to report to the House is the performance of one entrant: P Fletcher, who achieved a time of 26 minutes and 30 seconds for the five-kilometre run. That was, I am pleased to say, slightly better than the average time of 32 minutes and 17 seconds for the five-kilometre run, although, having had a look at the detailed results, I suspect that the median time as opposed to the average time was quite a lot lower than 32 minutes and 17 seconds. Even so, I was not unhappy with my performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The real reason that motivates me to speak about the San Run for Life is that this is an important event in my electorate of Bradfield. There were three events: a five-kilometre run, a 10-kilometre run and a five-kilometre walk. On this 10th occasion some 1,500 participants were involved in those three events. The event was hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Adventist_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Adventist Hospital
        </a>
        , which is universally known as the San. It is a major institution in my seat of Bradfield. It is a large high-quality research and teaching hospital. It is the largest private hospital by far on the upper
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and a much loved and valued institution in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The run is an excellent community event which encourages fitness, participation and healthy lifestyle habits. You run through the rolling hills and leafy streets of Wahroonga and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Fox Valley
        </a>
        . It is a very popular event, as demonstrated by the significant number of people who participated. The proceeds of the run—such moneys as are raised from the entry fees less the costs of organising the event—are provided to the Australasian Research Institute, which is the research arm of the Sydney Adventist Hospital and does important medical research.

        yesterday we heard from the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        about preventative health programs run by the government. Of course these are important, but the merit of the San fun run, as with so many similar events round the country, is that it is a community event organised within the community, with no government involvement. I particularly want to congratulate the San, its chief executive, Dr Leon Clark, and all of the many volunteers who were there from many community organisations, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        and Wahroonga Rotary, which is heavily involved in assisting with the organisation of this event. Most importantly, I want to congratulate all of the participants for a most enjoyable event. I congratulate them on taking action to look after their own health and have some fun along the way.

         I am sure that all honourable members would join in congratulating the member for Bradfield on his achievement.
