       <p>
        In Hotham we have some great community and sporting groups. One of these is the Oakleigh Amateur Football Club, better known locally as the Oakleigh Krushers. The Krushers were created by two local clubs merging in 1992: Oakleigh Sacred Heart football club and Emmanuel football club. This was no easy merger. We know these clubs had a bit of fierce competition on the football field, but they were able to come together, and since 1992 this club has provided a means for thousands of local young people to play a great game of community footy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to single out just three of the many amazing people involved in this terrific local club. Firstly, I want to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Alexander" rel="nofollow">
         Barry Alexander
        </a>
        , the club president. This year Barry celebrated 30 years as club president. He has dedicated his life to the club and embodies the true meaning of a community person. Barry's right-hand man is Oakleigh living legend Bruce 'Chooka' Garner. Chooka was born and bred in Oakleigh and has been grounds-manager, player and old-wise-head for the last 30 years. Finally, I acknowledge my good mate Pat Heverin: a committed volunteer, a great servant of the club, and always ready to shout the bar after a winâ€”so I am told. These three work tirelessly to ensure young people in Oakleigh have a safe and happy environment in which to play the game they love. They are true living legends who ask for nothing in return.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hear great things about the preseason and I hope to report back later in the year that the Krushers have a victory season in 2015.
