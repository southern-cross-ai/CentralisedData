        Today, I rise to pay tribute to the remarkable life and enduring legacy of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Clive" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Clive
        </a>
        Senior, a distinguished veteran, an esteemed community leader and beloved family man, who passed away 13 December 2023. Rob Senior's journey began in Sydney, where he received his education and embarked on a career of service to his country. Joining the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        in 1969, Robert served with distinction for 26 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. His dedication, expertise and leadership left an indelible mark on our armed forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        After retiring from the military, Rob continued his commitment to public service through his work in urban planning and consulting. His contributions to strategic infrastructure planning in

        </a>
        . His selfless volunteer work touched countless lives, from Meals on Wheels to community choirs, reflecting his deep compassion and generosity of spirit. Our community is better because of Rob's service to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rob's diagnosis of motor neurone disease in August 2023 was met with courage and resilience. Though his battle with the illness was brief, his legacy and service and kindness will endure for generations to come. Though he may no longer be with us, his legacy lives on in the hearts of his loved ones and the countless lives he touched throughout his lifetime. Vale, Robert Clive Senior.
