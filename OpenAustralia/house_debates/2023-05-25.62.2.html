        My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning the Energy Regulator released data showing electricity bills surging under this government by up to 25 per cent for households and 29 per cent for small businesses. The Prime Minister explicitly and repeatedly promised less than a month before last year's election that he would deliver cheaper electricity and an annual cut of $275 to electricity bills. Prime Minister, how can Australians already suffering cost-of-living challenges possibly trust the

           What would she know? A lot of what we have seen in the price increases today have been driven by unreliable coal plants, outages and very high fossil fuel prices so that transition to clean energy is critical to bringing down prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           What we are seeing is that the contracts that retailers buy for the coming financial year have fallen quite a bit since the intervention in the coal and gas markets in October last year. They are about 40 per cent lower than they were in October last year. That's what Clare Savage, the chair of the

                <p>
                 Thank you, Mr Speaker. He's angry because he knows that he voted against helping people. He voted against $3 billion in direct bill relief. He voted against the price caps on gas and coal that the Energy Regulator was speaking about today. He's angry because he opposed the Safeguard Mechanism—their own policy, supported by business and industry. He's angry because he was a part of a government that had 22 energy policies but didn't land one. He's angry because he left us with an energy grid that was built for the last century. He's angry because his government gave $4 million to the proponents of a coal-fired power plant in Collinsville, knowing there was no chance—no chance!—that it would actually go forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Those opposite are frozen in time while the world warms around them. Those opposite have no way forward. We have had practical measures put forward in this parliament to deal with the challenges that have arisen, that are global challenges that have had a global impact. Those opposite left us with a policy that simply wasn't landed. We're going forward and making a difference.

                      , our home state, has seen a 21 per cent increase, compared to what the Energy Regulator indicated to the government was likely—a 40 per cent increase—absent intervention. In relation to those households, 1.6 million in New South Wales, for example, have received the rebates negotiated by the Treasurer on behalf of the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Instead of facing a 40 per cent increase in power bills they will see an eight per cent decrease, an eight per cent cut, in their energy bills as a result of the intervention of the

                     <p>
                      There are similar figures right around the country. Take

                      </a>
                      for example, which was facing a 51 per cent increase. Instead we've seen a 24 per cent increase. After the impact of the rebates, there has been a three per cent cut in their energy bills.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The choice facing the Australian parliament was either to let these increases flow through to Australian households doing it tough and Australian businesses doing it tough or to intervene and act. The government chose to intervene and act. We've seen the impact of that today. Indeed, as the Prime Minister indicated, the Energy Regulator, in crystal-clear language, made the importance of that intervention clear earlier today, saying that these increases would have had a five in front of them in the absence of action. We've seen a similar response from the Australian Energy Council when talking about the impact of the rebates.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The honourable member asked me about threats. Not only did those opposite vote against the intervention but the Leader of the Opposition has doubled down, not admitted he got it wrong and said that he would rip up this intervention if he became Prime Minister. He would repeal the intervention. He would see these power price increases flow through to Australians without any intervention on his behalf. He wouldn't step forward to protect Australians against the impact of these increases. He would just let them rip. That's his policy—let these increases rip.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This government has a different approach. Whether you're in south-western Sydney or in suburbs or regions anywhere in Australia, this government will intervene to protect you from the impact of these power price rises. We will intervene to ensure support for Australians—

                            I withdraw the last part of the question. My question remains to the Prime Minister: hardworking Australian households and small businesses received news today that they will see huge increases in their electricity prices from 1 July. Each year households will be worse off by $594 in

                            , $512 in

                            and $402 in South-East Queensland, even though the Prime Minister promised they would be $275 better off. Why did the Prime Minister break his promise to the Australian people?

                              I'm asked about promises with regard to energy. At the 2019 election, the coalition promised to reduce the wholesale price of electricity to $70 per megawatt by the end of 2021. Spoiler alert: it didn't happen. By the time they left office, the price was $286. They promised $70 and they delivered $286. That was what we inherited. When they were in charge, the member for Hume also promised $1 billion to deliver 3,800 megawatts of new power generation. Spoiler alert: it didn't happen. Not a single kilowatt.

The Prime Minister is off on a frolic, and he should be brought back to the question.

                                        Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. We also had promises about Liddell. The former minister, the former member for Kooyong, used to stand here and speak about keeping it open. He promised time and time again. It closed at the end of April, exactly as was planned under their watch. That's exactly what was planned.

                                        What we have done is put in place a real plan, a real plan of $3 billion of energy price relief that they voted against—up to $500 in bill relief for eligible households and up to $650 in bill relief for small businesses. Real relief, right off your power bill, right when you need it. We've provided in the budget $1.6 billion for energy efficiency upgrades, including the new Small Business Energy Incentive. With Rewiring the Nation, $16 billion has been provided to unlock the grid, to upgrade it, so that it's able to accept more renewable energy. We signed Marinus Link, which was talked about by those opposite but nothing happened. We declared the first offshore wind zone in Australia. Four hundred community batteries are being deployed across Australia. We've implemented the Capacity Investment Scheme to unlock over $10 billion of investment in batteries, pumped hydro and more renewables in our grid. We have practical plans. Every one of them is opposed by the naysayers opposite.
