        Today my fellow co-convenor of the parliamentary friends of Palestine, the member for Reid; the convenor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        parliamentary group, the member for Fremantle; and I had the pleasure of hosting the launch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. This commemorative year was initially launched at the beginning of the 2014 session of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_the_Exercise_of_the_Inalienable_Rights_of_the_Palestinian_People" rel="nofollow">
         Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People
        </a>
        in January this year following a decision by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         UN General Assembly
        </a>
        on 26 November 2013 proclaiming 2014 as the Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and requesting that the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People organise activities throughout 2014 in cooperation with governments, relevant organisations of the United Nations system, intergovernment organisations and civil society organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The objectives of the IYSPP are to promote solidarity with the Palestinian people as a central theme, contributing to international awareness of (a) core themes regarding the question of Palestine, obstacles to the ongoing peace process, particularly those requiring urgent action such as the settlements, the question of Jerusalem, the blockade of Gaza and the humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and (b) the mobilisation of global action towards the achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting solution of the question of Palestine in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the UN Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. For many years now the Palestinian people have asked for the international community to stand with them to broker a just and lasting solution to this very protracted issue in the pursuit of peace and security for both sides to this conflict. The UN Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People is an opportunity for us as a parliament to look at how we can assist this process for the benefit of both the Israeli and Palestinian communities and also look at how Australia can effect a fair and balanced approach on this very important matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today's launch here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        was attended by over 70 people, including members of parliament, senators, ambassadors, members of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        , members of the local Palestinian community and advocacy groups, as well as representatives from the international Australian charity the Global Gardens of Peace. Speakers included Ambassador Izzat Abdulhadi, the head of the General Delegation of Palestine to Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the Pacific; Mr Christopher Woodthorpe, the Director of the United Nations Information Centre for Australia, New Zealand and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         South Pacific
        </a>
        ; and Bishop George Browning, the President of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network. It was a very successful event, which gave us all the opportunity to hear and exchange views on this very important issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        On another matter related to the Palestinian issue, I would like to table a petition from Just Peace for Palestine Brisbane, which is a subgroup of Just Peace Queensland Inc. This advocacy group aims to raise awareness about the ongoing human rights violations in Palestine. I wish to table in parliament their petition of 747 signatures. This petition was considered at a recent meeting of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions and is certified as being in accordance with standing orders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         The petition read as followsâ€”

       <p class="italic">
        This petition of concerned citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the House the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Children's_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Children's Fund
        </a>
        report released in February 2013 'Children in Israeli Military Detention'.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">
         UNICEF
        </a>
        reports on ill treatment of children who come into contact with the Israeli military detention system. The report concludes that the ill-treatment of children within the military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the process from the moment of arrest until the child's prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to consider the UNICEF report and its recommendations and to report back to the Parliament on what actions will be taken by the Australian government to support Palestinian children suffering ill-treatment in Israeli military detention, in contravention of the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

       <p>
        from 747 citizens

        Petition received.

       <p>
        Several countries have repeated these accusations in the UN General Assembly. For my part, and in conclusion, I hope the continuous efforts of those affected by the situation in Palestine will help the international community in brokering a peaceful and acceptable result for all. It is my hope, and certainly of those who attended this afternoon, that Australia will be on the right side of history and use its standing on the
