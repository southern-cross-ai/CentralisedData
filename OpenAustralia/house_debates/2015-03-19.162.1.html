        who passed away on 11 Marchâ€”only last week. I had the privilege yesterday of attending his funeral. It was a wonderful funeral service conducted by Reverend Alan Bulmer from Cressy. The obituaries were given by his son Kent Mainwaring and Senator Eric Abetz, who had been a long-time friend of Bob. They were all wonderful contributions, including that of Norm Warburton from the retired services branch of the

        from 1944 to 1946.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was a member of parliament for the state electorate of Lyons. He was 89 years old when he passed away. Robert 'Bob' Geoffrey Mainwaring OAM, JP was elected to the Tasmanian house of assembly in 1986, where he first served until 1989. He was defeated by the colourful, self-proclaimed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Avram" rel="nofollow">
         Duke of Avram
        </a>
        , the head of a tiny micro-nation on Tasmania's west coast. But Bob fought back to defeat the duke in 1992 and returned to parliament, where he stayed until 1998 when the reduction in the size of the state house of assembly meant that he lost his seat again under the Hare-Clark system. In 1992 he served as government whip.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was born on 9 February 1926. His first job, at the age of 15, was as a post office messenger on the north-west coast. After that, he took up a soldier settlement block on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        . He was one of the very early pioneers on Flinders Island and served that community for over 25 years as a council warden. He was on many committees. He had stories of a life that encompassed the time they used horses to a time when they used tractors. It really was the end of a generation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was known for his hard work, his commitment to his electorate, and his loyalty to his family, friends, colleagues and the people that he was elected to represent. But, most of all, he was a champion for the communities and particularly regional communities around Tasmania. He was awarded life membership of the Liberal Party and remained active in his branch until his death. Very few life memberships have ever been given in the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and it was recognition of the sort of person that Bob Mainwaring was.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob could trace his ancestry back to his farmer forebears who arrived in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Diemen's_Land" rel="nofollow">
         Van Diemen's Land
        </a>
        in 1835 as pioneers in the fledgling colony. Their numerous descendants include farmers and professionals of all kinds, as well as a wide range of tradespeople. Bob wrote and published a book about his family, called
        <i>
         Exiled to the colonies, 1835
        </i>
        , and a second book also on the pioneer families that settled Flinders Island. He was educated in the public school system and valued education all of his life. Much of his most cherished achievements were those of his children and grandchildren in terms of their academic endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        He and his wife, Carla, moved to Launceston after Bob retired. Although, I think he never really retired. He was chairman of the Association of Independent Retirees until well into his 80s. He is survived, as I mentioned, by his wife, Carla; three children, Diane, Kent and Nick, who I know quite well; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        I valued his friendship. I valued his counsel. I was proud to regard Bob Mainwaring as a friend. He was a loving husband. He was a servant to many clubs and committees and to the people of Tasmania. He will be sorely missed. Thank you.
