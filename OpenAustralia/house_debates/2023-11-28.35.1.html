        We all know that courage comes in many forms. From my experience, you will see courage on the sporting field, in our health and emergency service workers, and in our

        </a>
        personnel who can help people who can't necessarily help themselves. But you can also see courage in the form of a little blonde woman from Frankston, the member for Dunkley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before she came to this place, the member for Dunkley was a champion squash player—if you actually believe that squash is a sport!

         Mr Speaker, can I remind you that interjections are disorderly, and you need to protect me from the member for Dunkley at all costs as I make my comments! The member for Dunkley is a warrior for causes she is passionate about. She's a warrior for fairness, equality, women's rights and breast cancer, and a champion for battlers in her own community.

         Along with several members opposite, I attended a function in the member's electorate recently which was a celebration of 50 years—I'm not saying whose 50th birthday it was—and I listened to some lovely tributes on that night about her sporting career, her achievements, her life in law and, now, her life in politics. As the member for Dunkley reminded me this morning, she was no saint. I always remember the night when we overindulged in espresso martinis in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
          New York
         </a>
         and she accosted actress
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Byrne" rel="nofollow">
          Rose Byrne
         </a>
         and her family, and then proudly told me she'd also been having a conversation with K Flip. I told the member for Dunkley that her name is actually G Flip, to which the member for Dunkley replied, 'Well, actually, it's K Flip to all her friends.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Right now my friend the member for Dunkley is facing some serious health challenges; we know that. She is facing those challenges with courage, humility and good humour. It is bloody hard to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I know she has earnt the respect of all members in this place, on both sides of the chamber. We wish her great health and happiness as she faces those challenges in the days ahead. In the words of
