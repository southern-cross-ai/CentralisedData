       <p>
        I rise in this place today to congratulate the
        <i>
         Greek Community Tribune
        </i>
        , a Greek language newspaper that services and keeps the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n Greek community informed. Tomorrow night I will be attending a dinner organised by the
        <i>
         Greek Community Tribune
        </i>
        to commemorate 15 years since they first went to print. I take this opportunity to congratulate them and to wish them well for tomorrow night. It is South Australiaâ€™s only Greek language newspaper and it keeps the Greek community in South Australia informed. We all know how important it is to be informed through the media; it makes people feel connected to their community. The
        <i>
         Greek Community Tribune
        </i>
        lets people know what is happening locally, what is happening on an international scale and certainly lets them know of all the community events. The
        <i>
         Greek Community Tribune
        </i>
        was founded by a gentleman from the Riverland, Mr Peter Ppiros, who still runs the paper today. I also take this opportunity to congratulate Peter for the magnificent work he does. He is dedicated to ensuring that every edition is printed and delivered on time for very little reward. It is a passion that Peter has and, through many ups and downs, he has stood by the paper and ensured that it is printed and distributed across South Australia to keep readers informed.
