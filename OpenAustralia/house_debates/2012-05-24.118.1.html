       <p>
        As federal representative for Bennelong, I frequently visit businesses, schools and homes across the region to discuss important issues with the local community. Over the past two years I have witnessed an increasing pattern of concerns about the cost of living, difficulties faced by small businesses and apprehension over the carbon tax. Continued rises in the cost of living affect all families across our nation. Since 2007 the average increase in electricity costs is 51 per cent. Water is up 46 per cent, gas 30 per cent, health costs 20 per cent and grocery prices 14 per cent. It is our families who are forced to pay the bill, a problem that will be compounded in just five weeks when they get hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. The government's response is to waste a further $36 million on advertising to try to sell the carbon tax. These funds should be directed to the most vulnerable in our community. Bennelong families deserve better.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday I will be joining families at a local school in my electorate to discuss these issues and the impact this government's mismanagement of the economy is having on our local community. Small businesses are directly affected when families are hurting, leading to falling sales figures and reduced confidence. Every day we hear stories of businesses large and small being forced to shut down or retrench staff to keep the doors open.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make matters worse, these businesses are forced to struggle under the weight of red tape. Since the start of 2008, this Labor government has added 18,089 new regulations. This equates to 11 new regulations every day for 4Â½ years. When Labor was elected it promised a policy of one in, one out, meaning that any new regulations would be offset by the repeal of others. Instead, since 2007, only 86 regulations have been repealed. That is one for every 210 new regulations introduced. Rep tape chokes the life out of local businesses and community groups. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        has estimated that the rewards for Australia to cut red tape would be worth up to $12 billion a year. The coalition understands that stronger shops equal stronger communities and a healthier society. It is in our

        to take direction action to bring people together to support stronger communities. That is why I am rolling out the Bennelong Business Villages campaign to promote the need to support local community shopping centres with families, local clubs and media. It is through our policies that we will return the hope, reward and opportunity needed to reignite the community spirit of Bennelong and get out country back on track.
