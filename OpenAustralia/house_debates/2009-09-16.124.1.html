        I rise to speak about a couple of issues in my electorate, but before I do so I would like to associate myself with the comments of the honourable member for Lindsay about the good work of the sisters, particularly Sister Susan and Sister Josephine, and about the creados. I have had the privilege of knowing both the 2/2nd Independent Company and the 2/4th Independent Company, and Paddy Keneally was a friend. Sadly, I attended his funeral earlier this year. I was also able to witness one of the creados, Senor Rufino—a creado colleague, friend, amigo of Paddy Keneally—receive an award in

        . I felt I could not go without mentioning that.

       <p>
        The first issue I want to raise is that of the Cassino Northern Co-operative Meat Company. They are one of the biggest employers in the seat of Page. At the moment they are doing it a bit tough, and, according to their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , the Australian meat industry is doing it a bit tough. He said that ‘many plants on the Eastern seaboard have scaled back their operations’ and that the downturn is due to ‘many years of drought followed by flood, which caused major cattle losses’. He also said that the growing live export trade is putting significant pressure on the industry in Casino. These comments were made in the local paper, the

        , and there was an editorial about it. Meat

        , Kath Evans, also talked about the general issue and the issue of live exports. She said:

       <p class="italic">
        Exporting livestock is exporting jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand that any national government has the challenge of dealing with an industry. There is a live export industry. I have my views about it, and my view is that I will be supporting my local industry and taking up any issue that impacts on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing I want to mention is that a group of us in the community are working to make

       </p>
       <p>
        This great initiative has three key parts to it. The first is that Southern Cross University will develop football administration, coaching and business education courses to be the leading provider of tertiary football education in Asia. The second is that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        will become a non-metropolitan football nursery or talent incubator through encouraging elite coaching, youth tournaments, Indigenous player development, coaching seminars, links with the Asian youth teams and camps for FFA elite teams. The third is the establishment of a world standard football training facility in Lismore. I have also been liaising with Football Federation Timor Leste with regard to FFA, which is doing some mentoring and support programs. It is one of the good things that football can offer. Football is one of those sports that on any one weekend in my area—
