        Australia's involvement in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        officially ended over 50 years ago, in January 1973. By that time, more than 60,000 Australians, including around 300

        and some 15,300 conscripts who had been chosen under a luck of the draw birthday ballot process, had served in Vietnam. Of the 521 Australian lives lost in Vietnam, over 200 were conscripts. Another 3,000 returned home wounded.

        All the countries involved in the decade-long war paid a heavy toll.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_USA" rel="nofollow">
         The USA
        </a>
        lost around 58,000 personnel, while some estimates of the total lives lost from all sides including civilians exceed 3.5 million. In every country, including Australia, the war divided communities. On their return home, Vietnam soldiers were at times treated disgracefully, adding to the war trauma on their lives. Physical injuries, poor health and psychological issues continue to plague many of Australia's 35,000 Vietnam veterans still with us, with homelessness, alcohol abuse and family breakdowns common characteristics amongst them.

        In my own region, the northern branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association has become an invaluable support network for veterans. Since 2005, each year on 18 August, marking the anniversary of the 1966

        The annual service brings much deserved recognition to the Australians, mostly young men in their early 20s, who served in a horrific controversial war. This year's service, marking the 50th anniversary of the war's end for Australia, was particularly emotional. For most Australians, the Vietnam War took place before they were born. It was a different era. However, the soldiers who served, the trauma they experienced, the effects on themselves and their family should be recognised, appreciated and honoured. They should all be remembered with pride, gratitude and admiration.
