        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is the Prime Minister making the world's biggest carbon tax even bigger by imposing a carbon tax on heavy vehicles from 1 July next year?

              I certainly will not be taking any lectures about facts and carbon pricing from the opposition after the ridiculous fear campaign they have run around the country. What the Leader of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
               The Nationals
              </a>
              should know from our carbon-pricing scheme—it was made very clear at the time—is that we did not put a carbon price on petrol, diesel and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
               LPG
              </a>
              for passenger motor vehicles and for light on-road commercial vehicles. It has always been the subject of the scheme that, from 1 July 2014, there would be carbon pricing for heavy on-road vehicles, and that is of course because we wanted to see a situation of consistent treatment for modes of transport. Why did we want to do that?

                of Opposition Business is calling away. He might learn something. We believe climate change is real: fact No. 1. That is why we wanted to do it. Fact No. 2: we believe it is caused by human activity. Fact No. 3: we believe that we should get our economy ready for the future and reduce the carbon pollution generated by our economy. We looked around the world and saw other nations doing precisely that. Then of course is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition always finds the most deeply uncomfortable: the cheapest way of reducing the amount of carbon pollution that your economy generates is to put a price on carbon. Leading conservatives around the world know that. Former Prime Minister Howard knew that. The Leader of the Opposition sat in a cabinet that knew that, because they went to the 2007 election saying that they would bring a price on carbon pollution, an emissions-trading scheme, to Australia.
               </p>
               <p>
                None of those facts have changed. What has changed is that the Leader of the Opposition decided to ditch the facts and play the politics. On this side of the parliament we have always believed in those facts. We have always believed that the most effective way of reducing carbon pollution and the cheapest way of reducing carbon was to put a price on carbon. The Leader of the Opposition will never be able to say to the Australian people that he stands for a cheaper plan than ours. He does not, and that is why we will defend this plan up to and including at the next election and in the days beyond, because it is right for the country.

                  Dear me, they are back to old favourites today. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my statements during the 2010—

                   <p>
                    I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my statements during the 2010 campaign that our nation should have an emissions trading scheme. Indeed, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to get himself involved in the history books, he should look at his own statements in favour of a price on carbon and, if he has still got some time left—heaven knows he must have a lot of time; he does not do any policy work—maybe he could get out former Prime Minister Howard's statements on an emissions trading scheme. Maybe he could look at the documents that the cabinet he sat in authorised for publication, committing the then Howard government—of which he says he was proud to be a part—to putting a price on carbon. Yes, we will get to that emissions trading scheme through a fixed price for three years—what is referred to as a carbon tax.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Leader of the Opposition will never be able to walk away from his track record of having supported a price on carbon; he will never be able to say to the Australian people that his scheme is cheaper per tonne of carbon pollution; and he will never be able to say to the Australian people that, if he was ever Prime Minister, prices would somehow mysteriously go down. It is time for this mendacious campaign to end.
