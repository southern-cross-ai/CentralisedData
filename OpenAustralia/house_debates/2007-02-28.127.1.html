       <p>
        I recently attended a graduation ceremony at St Mary’s Senior High School. This is the first public senior high school in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        not to be established on the classical model of a senior high catering for years 11 and 12 and junior feeder high schools. This is a senior high stand-alone with only years 11 and 12, and it attracts students from all over the surrounding area. Indeed, a good proportion of the students that go to St Mary’s senior high, a public school, are from private schools. It is one of the few public schools to have this track record. I am a little sad because, with the redistribution, I will no longer be their local member.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2006, 441 students at the school completed the higher school certificate—43 more students than in 2005. Fifty-nine per cent of these students were offered round 1 offers at university and a number are receiving round 2 offers. This is a 10 per cent increase on the previous year. Of those who did not wish to go to university in 2007, the majority now have enrolled in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and private college courses or have gained traineeships and employment in their chosen field.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two students have obtained the Premier’s award for all-round excellence—Eihab Eltantawy and Amelia Goodson. There are also five students on the top achievers list. Three students were placed in the top 10 for society and culture in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        examination—Clare Calderwood, who was fourth in the state; Amelia Goodson, who was sixth in the state; and Cassandra Duncan, who was 10th in the state. Gagndeep Singh Jior was placed seventh in the state in physics, and Juleita Mariano was placed ninth in the state in business services. The school also had 136 entries in the distinguished achievers list, recognising band 6 performances in HSC courses—one less than in 2006. I congratulate Kristine Beazley and her team of dedicated teachers, the parents and citizens association and the students and parents on an outstanding educational institution, one that is serving its students exceptionally well.
