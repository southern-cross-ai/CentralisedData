        I rise to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Houghton" rel="nofollow">
         James Houghton
        </a>
        , who passed this week during a holiday to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . A man of faith, I spoke with James at church just about 10 days ago about how he was looking forward to his trip to New Zealand with family. James lived to serve and do his bit for the local community and to make the world a better place. Straight talking and widely respected, he followed his father into public life. James served the community in local government for 19 years and was first elected to

         Moreton Bay Regional Council
        </a>
        . He was greatly admired by staff and colleagues. James had a passion for local history, being born and bred in Redcliffe, and he remained committed to the local community throughout his life, being a member of the Mousetrap Theatre Company and the first president of the

        in 1967, which is still going.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from his passion for the community, James Houghton was a true Queenslander who loved his footy, playing for the

        this year for the first time. Dearest to his heart was family. He will be sadly missed by John and Lisa, Chris and Haley, and Geoff; grandchildren Paige, Mia and Joshua; sister Elizabeth and brother-in-law Daryl Gomersall and their daughters, Naomi and Megan; and sister June Merilees. Thank you, James, for a life of service. May you rest in peace.
