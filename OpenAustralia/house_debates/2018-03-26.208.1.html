       <p>
        Today I'd like to acknowledge a very talented young sportswoman, Monique Conti. On Saturday, Monique's team, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bulldogs" rel="nofollow">
         Western Bulldogs
        </a>
        , defeated the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Lions" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Lions
        </a>
        in the first Australian Football League Women's grand final, and Monique herself was best on ground for her brilliant performance in seeing her team take out the flag. And it's not just in footy. Monique is also a very gifted basketball player. Next month she will play for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Tigers" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Tigers
        </a>
        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEABL" rel="nofollow">
         SEABL
        </a>
        competition, and then put her football boots back on for the Victorian Football League Women's season that starts later in the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Monique was a Calwell constituent when she received a Local Sporting Champions grant, and she is proof that this grant program is crucial to helping young talented athletes. Monique is just one of the many athletes that have shone through this program, and I want to commend the program and make sure that we continue it well into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate Monique on her wonderful sportsmanship. I also want to extend my best to her family, who have been very supportive of herâ€”and, certainly, that grant was very useful, because, as we know, many families have to spend a lot of money supporting their children's sporting interests. Monique is also a student at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Deakin University
        </a>
        . I want to wish her all the very best in her studies and say to her that we are very proud of her. The Calwell community is very proud of Monique Conti.
