        Hoxton Industries is an organisation in my electorate which employs more than 100 people who otherwise face significant barriers to employment. The goal of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        is to support people with disabilities to achieve independence and success. While this bipartisan initiative is still to fully realise those aims across the country, Hoxton Industries has been doing that for over 50 years. Hoxton Industries provides meaningful employment to people with disabilities and has done so for half a century. Hoxton Industries predominantly provides packaging services for businesses, but has recently branched out into e-waste sorting and other opportunities. It now supports 145 staff over three sites at Villawood, Campbelltown and

        I attended Hoxton Industries' 50th anniversary recently and celebrated with former and current board members and staff. Amazingly, some of the staff have worked at Hoxton Industries for more than 40 years. The original board was formed by parents determined to give their children good, meaningful lives and contribute by working if the jobs that they were doing met their particular needs. I met the management team and heard about their hardworking staff. I'd like to congratulate Mr Warren Jones and his board, as well as the chief executive officer, Nicole Bruce, and her team for their outstanding achievements. Congratulations on 50 years.
