       <p>
        I recently visited Services Australia in Windsor. I was honoured to be given a tour by team leader, Skye, who took us through their work and the customer experience. When we talk about Higgins, images of sprawling estates, ambition and opportunity come to mind. We must not forget that disadvantage hides in plain sight. Higgins has a lack of addiction services and a significant ageing population, many of whom struggle when identity theft occurs. For families, the complexities of child care are often difficult to navigate. This is where Services Australia steps in. The team at Services Australia Windsor assists up to 750 people per week, totalling upwards of 40,000 people per year. This requires staff to think quickly on their feet, all the while maintaining their professionalism in the face of distressed customers trying to navigate a system that has become overly complex.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skye and the team often deal with vulnerable customers in crisis, not unlike what I experienced in my previous role as a doctor at

        . They provide that soft landing when people struggle. Their mantra is, 'Help as much as we can as soon as we can. The same is applicable to this House. The work that Skye and her team provide is vocational, requiring a sense of compassion, patience and emotional intelligence. They are motivated by justice. The fact that they have a couple of professionals like Steve, who has celebrated 30 years of service, is testament to their mission and their culture. Their work is rewarding and purposeful, and we are immensely grateful for their service.
