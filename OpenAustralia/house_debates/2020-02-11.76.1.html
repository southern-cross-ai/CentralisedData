        My question is to the Minister for Education, representing the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister please update the House on what the Morrison government is doing to secure new trade opportunities for Australian businesses and how this is creating more Australian jobs?

         I thank the member for Sturt for his question. He knows that trade means jobs. Australia has 13 free trade agreements in force. Another two are concluded but not yet in force, including the historic agreement with Indonesia. We know what that is going to do: help build trade between Indonesia and Australia and create more jobs. Four are being negotiated, and there's a prospective

         </a>
         -Australia agreement in the pipes, which will also be incredibly important, given Brexit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since coming to office, the coalition government has started and concluded seven free trade agreements. More than 50 per cent of the free trade agreements that this nation has concluded have been concluded by our side in our term of government. Where does this count? ABS data last week showed Australia posted its largest ever calendar-year trade surplus in 2019—$67.6 billion. It also marked a record-breaking run of 24 consecutive monthly trade surpluses. You have to go back to 1972-73 to get such a run. That is what our government has delivered. What does it mean to important sectors of our economy? Resources are up over 17 per cent. Manufacturing exports are up over nine per cent. Rural exports are up $225 million to almost $48 billion. And what about our services exports, which grew by 8.9 per cent? For the first time, our services exports are over the $100 billion mark. That is what our government is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why are we doing this? We are doing this because we know that trade creates jobs. That's why we are doing it. One in five jobs in Australia are reliant on trade, and, for regional and rural Australia, it's one in four jobs. That is why we want to make sure that we are putting the trade agreements in place.

           I really am finding it very hard to hear the minister. He continually turns away from the microphone, and we cannot hear his answer. It's a fascinating subject matter, and we can't hear him.

            The member for Lyons can resume his seat. I don't need your commentary—I really don't. It is true that, when ministers turn, the noise is not there through the microphone. But can I point out to the member for Lyons—I am trying to keep a straight face—that mostly we can't hear because of your interjections. So I tell you what; I'll do a deal with the member for Lyons: he can never interject again and I'll make sure ministers speak directly into the microphone. The minister has the call.

             That sounds like a good deal, Mr Speaker. It is incredibly important how this government is focusing on jobs. There are now 53,000 businesses in our nation exporting, and that includes 46,000 small businesses. That's up 18.5 per cent since 2014. We're focused on jobs. Those on the other side can be cynical—and you can smirk and be smarmy and smart. But over this side we are focusing on the Australian people and creating jobs through trade—and we're proud of it.
