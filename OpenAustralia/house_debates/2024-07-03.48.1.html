       <p>
        With millions of Australians struggling to keep a secure and affordable roof over their heads, there's no doubt we're in a housing crisis. And nowhere is this more apparent than in a Tasmanian winter. Indeed, with winter temperatures in Tasmanian homes averaging as low as 10 degrees, according to one study, it can be even worse for the tens of thousands of Tasmanians shivering through winter in poorly maintained social and private rentals. And of course let's not forget the more than 2,300 Tasmanians experiencing homelessness, who, all too often, only have a tent flap between them and the cold.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, there's lots of noise from the federal government about doubling housing and homelessness funding in the budget, but the reality is that the funding for Tasmania will in fact decline this year under the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, from $38.1 million to $37.4 million, which is shocking in itself. But it's all the more worrisome considering the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness is a Tasmanian. Surely the minister must have seen the desperate need in our state? Surely her office has been continually contacted by constituents desperate for a place to live? My office sure has been. No wonder the community is looking to the government to do much more, especially in Tasmania, where the housing crisis is staring us in the face every day.
