        I rise today to congratulate the

        , which is within the good electorate of Adelaide, on winning the Economic Development Strategic Planning Award. This national award was presented at the Economic Development Australia conference in Sydney recently.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">

        of Prospect received the award in recognition of its outstanding digital economy strategy, which was prepared by the city’s business and economic development director,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harrison" rel="nofollow">

        , with, I am delighted to say, the support of councillors of all different backgrounds under the dedicated leadership of Mayor David O’Loughlin.
       </p>
       <p>
        This award is fitting for the city of Prospect, as my ministerial colleague the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Conroy" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Conroy

        has declared its strategy to be the best digital economy strategy in Australia. The strategy was developed with the objective of creating a digital-savvy community, which in turn generates demand for broadband services over optical fibre while simultaneously increasing incomes for small to medium enterprises. It has been adopted by seven member councils in the Eastern Region Alliance of councils in Adelaide and has been in demand from Regional Development Australia boards, local government authorities and state government departments as a model digital economy engagement strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really pleased that the City of Prospect has received national recognition for the significant amount of work it has put into this. The City of Prospect understands that a 21st century economy requires 21st century infrastructure, and that is critical to our government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        . The development of the City of Prospect’s strategy highlights not only that it welcomes the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        but also that it is preparing our local community through digital economy engagement projects, making sure that residents, schools, health services and local businesses can take advantage of affordable high speed broadband.
       </p>
       <p>
        In partnership with the City of Prospect, I am absolutely delighted that phase 2 of the NBN rollout will include our local community as one of the next 19 sites to receive the NBN. I encourage all residents and businesses to express their interest in making the switch from ageing copper wire to optical fibre and to demonstrate our community’s enthusiasm towards the NBN. I know that many residents across the Adelaide electorate understand just how important this infrastructure investment is in supporting our local economy, in the provision of health services and in improving the way we operate as a community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have no doubt that residents outside of the phase 2 rollout within the seat of Adelaide will be watching with a keen interest in the benefits that the NBN will bring to our local community. I look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the council to deliver affordable high-speed broadband.
