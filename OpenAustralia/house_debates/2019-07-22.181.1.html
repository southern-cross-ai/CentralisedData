        As the member for Mayo did, it's my pleasure to inform the House that winter has arrived in the north as well! The temperatures have been getting as low as 18! It's been a rough one!

        As with most things, we do our winters a little bit differently in the

        for those who appreciate motor sports, and our Darwin cup carnival is well and truly underway. I must inform the chamber here that I had a win on Saturday on a horse that I chose because its name was Clever Tommy, and my little brother Tommy, who I think is quite clever, was the beneficiary of the win there. When I get back, the Darwin Show will be on, and it's always a magnificent couple of days. The week after that, the Nepali community will be having their food and cultural festival at the waterfront, which is always a great event with loads of great entertainment. The Top End at this time of year just comes alive with so many festivals. The community are really getting involved, and I encourage all members to come up and get involved.
