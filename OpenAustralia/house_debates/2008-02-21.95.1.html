        There is no doubt that climate change is one of the biggest challenges we as a nation face. We are told by the experts that as the earth’s average temperature rises we will see some more dramatic changes to our weather, unfortunately—unfortunately for the people of Queensland, especially. Extreme events such as droughts, heatwaves, floods and storms will become more regular and more intense. This is caused by increased greenhouse gases, which are a by-product of our modern world. Activities like logging and burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas produce greenhouse gases. The greenhouse effect is the cause of climate change or global warming and, obviously, this affects us all.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I am proud to stand here as part of a government that is taking the challenge of greenhouse gases seriously. Literally, the first order of business for the Rudd Labor government was to ratify the Kyoto protocol, as the Prime Minister informed the House on Monday—not within 11 years but within 11 minutes of taking office. So, importantly, Australia can hold her head up high now and be part of the global solution to climate change rather than part of the problem. The Rudd Labor government has committed to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050. This will be achieved through a comprehensive emissions trading scheme by 2010. We will also adopt renewable energies such as wind and solar—

         What about a clean energy tax?

          Just wait and I will get to it, mate. This will also ensure that by 2020 our national electricity supply will be 20 per cent renewable energy. We can all do our bit to reduce our carbon footprint, like the Chelmer-Graceville Kindergarten in my electorate. They used an Australian government grant to install a 14,000-litre water tank to improve their irrigation system and to upgrade to dual-flush toilets and water efficient taps. It was a great honour for me for this to be the very first plaque that I unveiled as a federal member. The Chelmer-Graceville Kindergarten has become an example to all of us of just how precious our water resources are and how we can all make a difference to our environment. Unfortunately, the previous government did not offer enough of this kind of assistance or enough incentives to households and businesses to be water and energy efficient. The Rudd government will not make the same mistake. The Rudd government will not be found wanting when it comes to climate change, unlike previous governments. They should hang their heads in shame.
         </p>
         <p>
          Incentives for Australian households and businesses include $10,000 low-interest loans for households to implement energy and water savings, $8,000 rebates for rooftop solar panels, $1,000 rebates for solar power hot water service systems, improved energy and water efficiency standards for new homes and appliances and the making of every school a ‘solar school’ within eight years. These measures, along with our international obligations, will help all Australians play a part in the fight against climate change.
