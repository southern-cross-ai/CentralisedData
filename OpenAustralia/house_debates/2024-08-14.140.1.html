       <p>
        I rise today to highlight and condemn, on behalf of Australia's Bangladeshi community, the terrible scenes that we've watched unfold in Bangladesh over recent weeks. The nation, rich in culture and resilience, is facing substantial challenges. Beneath its vibrant surface, Bangladesh is grappling with complex issues that deserve Australia's thoughtful consideration and action.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's incredibly distressing whenever we see governments use force against their own citizens, especially those who are attempting nothing more than peaceful protest about the decisions of a government or a court system. The clashes between the people and the government have resulted in dozens of deaths of young university students and hundreds of injured people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've got a strong association with the Bangladeshi diaspora in Australia, and I want to extend to them my thoughts and concern. Obviously, we advocate for an open and democratic society in Bangladesh. I want to thank all the members of the community that have written to me extensively about the issue and have kept us up to date as parliamentarians about developments in the country. They are understandably fearful for the lives of their families and friends that live in Bangladesh. The distance from Bangladesh makes this very difficult.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been made all the more difficult by the distress at seeing government shut down the internet. Modern societies can be terrifying in that a government can shut down a single organ of communication and thereby control its citizenry. It's something we have to watch here as a free and open democracy. The government decision has cut off citizens from their fellow country people and from external care and thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I think it's important to stand up in our region for the principles of democracy that Australia represents. We encourage peaceful resolution of these issues. We encourage the government to engage with its citizens in open dialogue and not to shut down, censor or persecute those that seek peaceful protest.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are fortunate to live in a democracy where these rights have been traditionally respected and upheld. It's something we need to continue to fight for. We also need to continue as a parliament to call out those governments in our region that do not do the right thing by their own populations and erode freedom and democracy in our region. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the need for our powerful advocacy as a country. We are respected in our region and in the international community. We do have a strong voice, and I encourage the government to use that voice here in relation to what is happening in Bangladesh.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Bangladesh moves forward, especially in the wake of the ousting of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina" rel="nofollow">
         Sheikh Hasina
        </a>
        , it's imperative that the country rebuilds with the tenets of democracy at its fore. It's something that we would welcome. Every voice amongst the Bangladeshi people deserves to be heard without fear of retribution. I know Australia and the entire parliament strongly condemn all of the violence that we've seen, especially government violence, and call on all parties involved to work urgently towards a peaceful solution with the principles of democracy in mind.
