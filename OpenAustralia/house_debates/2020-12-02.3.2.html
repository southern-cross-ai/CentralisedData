        (b) the report found that:

       <p class="italic">
        (i) more than 1 in 5 BNPL consumers surveyed missed a payment in the past 12 months, resulting in over $43 million in late fees for the 2018-19 financial year;

       <p class="italic">
        (ii) most BNPL consumers who had missed a payment had used multiple BNPL providers in the past six months;

        (c) BNPL providers have stated no more than 1 per cent of their consumers have been in financial hardship during COVID-19, and that this is inconsistent with the observations contained in the ASIC report for the 2018-19 financial year; and

        (2) expresses its opposition to the recently intensified repression directed at human rights and labour rights defenders in the Philippines, evident by:

        (b) the deteriorating human rights environment and the rise in unlawful killings by state agencies which means that workers, civil servants, trade union organisations, and labour activists fear for their safety;

        (c) the nearly three-year extension of martial law in Mindanao, after it was initially approved for sixty days, and which only ended in December 2019; and

        (4) calls on the Government to support the upholding of labour and human rights, in line with international standards, by endorsing:

        (b) any auditing process of Australian security engagements in the Philippines, such as the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Program, as a way of ensuring we are not indirectly supporting human rights violations in the Philippines.
