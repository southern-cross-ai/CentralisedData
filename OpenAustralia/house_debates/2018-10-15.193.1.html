       <p>
        Earlier this month I launched a campaign to get a fair go for locals, local businesses, the local economy and local jobs throughout
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . In recent years multinational mining companies have extended their trading terms beyond the standard 30 days, putting enormous pressure on our small to medium enterprise suppliers. In some cases, payment terms have been further extended beyond 60 days to 90 days, and there are even some reports of 120 days.
       </p>
       <p>
        My campaign, including a petition to sign at makeit30days.com.au, calls on big mining companies to revert to standard payment terms of 30 days or less. In the first couple of days the campaign attracted hundreds of signatures from locals because they understand the impact that extended payment terms have on local businesses and jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of extended payment terms, businesses have millions of dollars tied up and are unable to invest in growth and jobs at a time when the resource industry is ramping up and when growth and jobs are desperately needed. To make matters worse, some of these big mining companies are offering loans, with interest, to businesses to help them with their cash flow. But none of that would be necessary if they just paid their bills on time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge big mining companies with extended payment terms to voluntarily revert to Australian business standards of 30-days-or-less payment terms. Failing to do so will invite government to use the heavy hand of legislation to force them to do so. I look forward to seeing those miners do the right thing and give locals a fair go by paying their bills on time.
