        There has been commentary in recent days about the pronunciation of names, countries and locations as part of

        </a>
        growing up in what was at that time a very white community, these were not names and pronunciations I was used to. Here in Australia, as in many other Anglo-speaking countries, we pronounce my name as 'key-oh'. I, like many other families who have moved to Australia over the centuries, have had my name badly mispronounced. In fact, the Irish pronunciation is actually 'keogh'. I know Lucy Zelic and Craig 'Foz' Foster—my apologies for my mispronunciation—addressed this issue head-on yesterday. I want to congratulate them for that. My community is becoming more and more ethnically diverse and it is through this increasing diversity that our community and our nation become stronger and more prosperous economically, socially and culturally. SBS's World Cup coverage helps us to all better engage and understand our communities.

        I extend my best wishes and support to the Socceroos as they take on Peru tonight. I think I speak for us all when I say that we would like to see

        take to the pitch during the game as well. May you continue to go far in the tournament, just as the Matildas have done in theirs. We hope for a win. We also hope for a French win. Good luck.
