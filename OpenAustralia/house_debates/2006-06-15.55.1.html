        My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports of opposition to the government’s major superannuation reform? What would it mean if opponents were successful in defeating the government’s changes?

         I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. In this year’s budget the government announced the most significant superannuation changes in the last two decades, and they were very widely welcomed. The Investment and Financial Services Association said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The effective removal of end benefits tax and tax on super pensions is a major step toward the simplification of an overly complex ... regime.

         So we have near universal endorsement of the government’s plan for the greatest reform to superannuation in the last two decades. Who would oppose it and on what grounds? I was very concerned to read in the
         <i>
          Age
         </i>
         newspaper today in an article titled ‘
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday I raised the issue that Labor had been ominously silent—that Labor had not come out and supported this change—and now we see Senator Sherry slipping around to the
         <i>
          Age

         newspaper to tell us Labor’s real plan. Labor’s real plan is to dig in over the abolition of taxes on superannuation.

           <p>
            Seeing that we are interested in employee entitlements, let me tell people what Labor’s opposing this superannuation reform will mean for them. If you are a 25-year-old on $1,000 a week and receiving the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG" rel="nofollow">
             SG
            </a>
            , and if Labor is able to defeat these reforms, you will be worse off in retirement by $7,000 a year. If that same 25-year-old earning $1,000 took his lump sum, and if Labor succeeds in opposing this plan, his lump sum would be reduced by $37,000. Just in case you thought that it was only young people that Labor was against, a 65-year-old retiring with a $400,000 allocated pension under Labor’s system would have their allocated pension reduced by $4,900 a year. If that same 65-year-old took their money in a lump sum, their lump sum would be reduced by $43,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            The young and the old stand to benefit from this superannuation plan. It has the support of

            and the Institute of Actuaries. The only person who does not have the guts to stand up and back the government’s reform is the Leader of the Opposition. He was warned about this by former senator
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
             Susan Ryan
            </a>
            , who endorsed the government’s plan. Not only did former senator Susan Ryan—a former Labor minister—endorse the government’s plan but she finished off her article in the
            <i>
             Australian
            </i>
            on Friday, 12 May 2006 by saying:

            Maybe faced with the Treasurer’s bold gazumping of Labor’s cherished but slightly shabby super property, the Opposition will find the resolve to get another big picture worked out, and the wherewithal to let voters know about it.
