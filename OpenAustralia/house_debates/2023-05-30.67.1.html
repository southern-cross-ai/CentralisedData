        Prime Minister, you're a strong supporter of local government. Federal assistance grants used to be distributed to help the most disadvantaged local council communities based on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEIFA" rel="nofollow">
         SEIFA
        </a>
        index. Fairfield council in Fowler is rated as No. 1 by the index. However, the previous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Liberal government changed the definition of 'disadvantage', resulting in funds being diverted to more favourable seats. What will your Labor government do to fix this inequity so that funding is prioritised for disadvantaged communities under SEIFA?

          With respect to the member for Fowler, that would appear to be a question about the actions of the former

           New South Wales

          <p>
           I may allow the member for Fowler to rephrase the question under standing order 98. You need to make sure that the question is directly relevant to the Prime Minister's responsibility—i.e. what he's responsible for. If another level of government or government has made a determination, the Prime Minister or minister is not responsible for that decision. I'll allow the member for Fowler to perhaps rephrase the question to make it directly relevant to either the Prime Minister or the minister responsible.

            I'll rephrase it. You're a strong supporter of local government. The Federal Assistance Grants used to be distributed to help the most disadvantaged local council communities based on the

            in Fowler is rated No. 1 by the index. What will the federal government do to ensure that funding will be allocated appropriately to local government, to prioritise disadvantaged communities under SEIFA?

              (—) (): I thank the member for Fowler for her question. To be frank, I'm not aware of some of the details that she raises with regard to local government funding and changes that were made by, as I think the member suggested, the former
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              government. But the member for Fowler is absolutely correct to say that I'm a supporter of local government, and that's why in the coming month there will be a re-meeting of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Council
              </a>
              of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
               Local Government
              </a>
              where every single mayor and shire president will be meeting with the federal government, including all of my ministers, to make sure that you get that direct engagement involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm a firm believer, as well, in needs-based funding for local government, and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Grants_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Commonwealth Grants Commission
              </a>
              makes assessments based upon equity issues. I'm very conscious that an area such as
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
               Liverpool City Council
              </a>
              is a disadvantaged area and therefore should receive more support than some other areas that are in a stronger position to raise revenues themselves in their local communities, owing to the factors that Commonwealth Grants Commission—at arm's length—determines for the funding arrangements.
             </p>
             <p>
              In my view—and this is something I've put for a long time—funding for local community infrastructure is best delivered through local government. Local councils know what the priorities of their local communities are, and they also have accountability mechanisms, including auditing and proper processes, to make sure that you don't have funding from government which advantages one private sector operator over another. You've seen that that can create real problems with integrity issues. We saw that with colour-coded spreadsheets under the former government. I believe that those fundings being through local government is very important. This side of the House will always speak up for stronger relations with local government. I met with the local government minister just this morning talking about her local community around Narooma but also talking in general about the Australian Council of Local Government and how it will function. I look forward to participating in that process as Prime Minister.
