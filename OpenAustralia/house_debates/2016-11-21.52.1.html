        ns were deeply disturbed by reports that emerged on Friday that the Deputy Prime Minister is planning to rip up the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He is walking away from returning an extra 450 gigalitres to the river. This is an absolute disgrace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Watson, when he was environment minister, did what many thought was absolutely impossible—indeed, I thought it was impossible—that is, to strike the Murray-Darling Basin Plan with the states. It was a plan that would save the river and continue to provide water for irrigating communities. It was an agreement that was in the national interest. It turns to this government to walk away from that plan.

        I was sceptical when this Deputy Prime Minister was made Minister for Water. But South Australians gave him the benefit of the doubt. They are not giving him the benefit of the doubt anymore. They are deeply concerned and he needs to come to the dispatch box and say he will not rip up the plan. He will not actually walk away from an agreement that returns 3,200 gigalitres to the

        . It is in irrigators' interests that the river does not die. We saw that in South Australia, where irrigators and environmentalists alike joined hand in hand to save the Murray. It is time that the Deputy Prime Minister did the same and protects this plan.
