        Earlier this month I had the great pleasure of joining members of the Katoomba community in celebrating the 20th anniversary of Varuna, the Writers House. Varuna provides writers with a quiet place to escape the everyday pressures and constraints of life, allowing five writers each week of the year to retreat from everyday life and focus on their writing. The organisation behind Varuna, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Dark" rel="nofollow">
         Eleanor Dark
        </a>
        Foundation, also provides other services directly related to encouraging writers. The ongoing support of the arts is so critical to preserving our literary history and providing opportunities for budding writers from all over the country to come to Varuna to hone their skills and to explore their writing in a supportive environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The house was constructed in the 1930s by Australian writer Eleanor Dark and her husband, Dr Eric Dark. A great writer, Eleanor wrote many short stories, articles and 10 novels. Her best selling novel was the 1941

        . An important figure in Australian literature, Eleanor won many awards, receiving an

        Inheriting the home in 1989, Mick Dark formed the Eleanor Dark Foundation, with the house to be used as a writers centre. Following his generous donation, the house was renovated in 1990 with funding contributed by numerous state government authorities and the first Varuna fellowships began in December 1990, with the house officially opened by the then state Minister for the Arts, the Hon.

       <p>
        Varuna, the Writers House, offers a variety of services for anyone interested in writing. For the professional writer, the Eleanor Dark Foundation administers several scholarship programs. These scholarship programs, offered in partnership with major publishers, including Penguin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_House" rel="nofollow">

        , are designed to encourage budding writers taking the next step from writing to publishing. Committed to developing young writers as well, Varuna offers the Ray Koppe Young Writers Residency to ensure that young writers are not forgotten or overlooked. Varuna also runs several masterclasses and workshops for those in the community interested in literature and provides mentoring services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many examples of great Australian literature are written by Varuna alumni. Notable works include

        community and writers all over the country. His modesty, generosity and ongoing support for the work of Varuna is something which should be celebrated. Others who deserve congratulations include Lis Bastian, Lynn Vernon and their team for the outstanding work they have done to raise the profile of Varuna, the Writers House, throughout the country. I congratulate everyone at Varuna for reaching this milestone and look forward to their success continuing into the future.
