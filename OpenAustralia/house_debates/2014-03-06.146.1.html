        I want to pay tribute to the community groups that helped out on

         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        last Sunday. I know that many members from around our great nation participated. Last year I was down at Semaphore Park helping to clean up rubbish and making the place a more beautiful spot. This year I was out with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya_Muslim_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Ahmadiyya Muslim Association
        </a>
        and it was great to see over 150 of their community participating in Clean Up Australia Day at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         West Beach
        </a>
        and also in other areas of Adelaide. I then went down to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Henley Beach
        </a>
        , where the

        One of the candidates for the next state election, Terina Monteagle, the candidate for Ashford, was out there with her community groups. I pay tribute to the work she did as I am sure did many other Liberal candidates. Terina has been very impressive in the way she has worked with local soccer clubs and football clubs, helping them get federal grants, which we are looking forward to delivering.

        , the candidate for Colton, ran a small business and has worked in the education sector. Late last year I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Henley High School
        </a>
        and was impressed with the school's leadership, vision and plans. Importantly, I also sensed a positive atmosphere in the school grounds , watching the learning that was going on with the students and the teachers. Following the visit, I talked with Joe Barry . We believe we should get some funding for the school, given their plans. So we asked for more detail and I am proud to say that this week the s tate Liberal Party announced they would fund a n ew science centre costing $6.8 million if they are successful in wining government. We all acknowledge that science and knowledge based areas are most important for our economy going forward. Support for science fac ilities will greatly assist that.

        Back to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        election. Can South Australia really afford another four years, making 16 years of a Labor government? As I mentioned earlier in this House today, I am greatly concerned for my children's future job opportunities. The CommSec
        <i>
         State of the states
        </i>
        report talks about South Australia's economy showing the worst economic performance on mainland Australia. Like my colleague here, the member for Bass, we have economies which are challenged and interestingly have had state Labor governments for too many years. Domestic spending contracted in the September quarter and in 2012-13, South Australia was the only state to decline in exports.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the Committee for Adelaide on their report which said in November last year that for people to stay in our state they need the opportunity for employment in a thriving labour market. The reality is that the labour market is not thriving. That is because the state Labor government is not thriving as well. I have not mentioned the state debt but I want to reflect on it: six deficits in seven years, only marginally better than their federal Labor colleagues who never delivered a surplus in six years; and $14 billion is the forecast debt, which is at the highest level.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state Labor government bragged about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAA
        </a>
        credit rating but former Premier Rann, Treasurer Foley and Snelling promised to keep the AAA credit rating because, if we did not, it would send our states spiralling into an abyss of debt. He is correct, it has gone into the abyss of debt because they have lost it. We have had five credit rating downgrades in two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to the candidates who are soldiering on. We have some good councillors. David Speirs is in Bright, whom I visited at the Masonic Homes with your good self, Madam Speaker, and had a lovely morning tea and a forum. Carolyn Habib is in the community sector.

        we have Nicola Centofanti and Andrew McLachlan. I wish them all the best, as well as the other candidates.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate these fine candidates. I have worked with them doorknocking and at supermarkets. They have been great at attending community events, really engaging well in the community. I wish them the best of luck on 15 March to deliver a better economic future for South Australia. That will only come with a change to a state Liberal Marshall government.
