       <p>
        For several years I have been pleased to support an initiative called the Nappy Collective. My electorate office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Seven Hills
        </a>
        has been a drop-off point for locals to deliver their surplus unused nappies once their babies have grown out of them. Each year I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of our local residents in Greenway who have supported this initiative, and every year it gets bigger and bigger. The collection ran last week, and I would like to thank everyone from the Greenway community who donated their surplus nappies. They go to people who really need them. Every donation helps parents and babies who are in need, and over the years the initiative has collected nearly two million nappies to support families who need assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to give a particular shout out. I was informed this morning that a local resident and her two friends recently dropped off an amazing 5,160 nappies that they collected from their neighbours, friends and relatives for The Nappy Collective. It was organised by Jenny Ousta and her friends Bec Lubric and Mary Geracitano. And, at the risk of using a prop, I want to show you this picture that my office has sent me. You can see that the nappies are filling up half my electorate office, and it is for such a worthy cause. A lot of people say they are proud to be members in this place. I am proud of the residents I represent in this place.
