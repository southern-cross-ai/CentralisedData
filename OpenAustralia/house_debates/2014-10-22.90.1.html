        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. Why hasn't the minister returned to the House to correct the following drought related statement he made during question time on Monday:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … you actually get the money until the department decides that you are not allowed to get the money. So you keep on getting the money until such time as, on the application being assessed, they decide you are not eligible for it. But it is not the case that you apply for the money and then you have to wait for your application to be approved … You actually get the money straight away.

          Before the Leader of the House puts his point of view, at the moment you could describe the question as incomplete, because the member's time elapsed before he had completed—

           Madam Speaker, I think you have summarised it well. The point is that there was no discrepancy pointed out that needs to be corrected. There was simply an assertion made, and therefore there was no question, and the call should go to the member behind me.

            Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was at the start, where the minister was asked why he has not returned to the House to correct the statement, and then the statement was given. There is no standing order that says the question has to be at the end. You can say, 'Why haven't you returned to correct this?'—

            <p>
             The member will resume his seat. The question did begin precisely as you said. He did ask why the minister did not return to the House. He then went on to give a statement as to why he believed he should—

              Madam Speaker, I appreciate the quote was difficult to decipher, but there is no argument that says at what point the quotation had to conclude.

                 As I have said, the difficulty is that the question was not completed within the time allocated under the standing orders. Although the question 'Why has the minister not returned to the chamber?' was asked, the reason why you were purporting that he should have was not completed within the time.

                    Madam Speaker, even if you accept that the whole of the last sentence of the quote was not complete before I ran out of time, how does that in any way change the question and the meaning of the quote? Go back simply to the allegation that the money is automatically paid. That point was made in the quote. It is wrong, and the minister should be required to address that issue.

                        Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is no requirement under standing orders, if someone intends to ask three or four questions and they only get through some of them, that therefore the entire question is ruled out. There is nothing within the standing orders—to the point of order—that says we have to determine whether or not someone would have liked to add other words. The one thing is: was a question asked? A question was asked. I reckon it will be challenging for him to answer, but we would love to hear the answer. It might be as good as Monday's!
