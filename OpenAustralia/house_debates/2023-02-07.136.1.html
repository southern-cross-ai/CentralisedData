        The mountains have mourned this January, with the deaths of three active community members.

        in the 1980s when he was reviewing motorbikes, was an active and engaged member of the Valley Heights Rail Museum. All three made significant contributions to the community in their own way, drawing on their talents and their skills. They'll be very much missed, and my sympathies go to their grieving families and friends.

        In the Hawkesbury, the extended Watson family is dealing with the loss of their beloved dad, husband, grandad and great-grandad Alan, who was married to Dharug elder Aunty Edna Watson. I've known Uncle Alan for about a decade, but it was a privilege to hear much more about his earlier life at his funeral. It was a celebration of a life well lived, with some hard work and stories of how he never gave up and was always there for his friends—a bit of mischief and quite a bit of humour, but no-one was ready to let him go. The last time I was with Uncle Alan was on

        for her significant service to the community through a range of organisations. As Jennifer said, she was going to contribute to her community with or without a medal, but I think we're all delighted that her Rotary work, as a member of Central Blue and internationally, plus her contribution as the former chair of Varuna, the National Writers House, has been recognised in this way.
