       <p>
        Today I want to acknowledge some of the amazing women that worked so hard to organise events celebrating
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        . Of course, all these women work hard all year to celebrate women. I want to start with Sue Advani—the amazing Sue Advani. She's the president of Seva International, which came together with Boronia Multicultural Services and Parramatta city council in Wentworthville to host a wonderful event. I'd also like to thank Bernadette Agyepong, who's the manager of Boronia, and Sharmila Falzon, who's the community capacity building officer for Parramatta council. It was a great day, with lots of women there celebrating our diversity. It was really wonderful.
       </p>
       <p>
        That night too, I went to an event in Rosehill organised by Maxine Simmons from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOW" rel="nofollow">
         WOW
        </a>
        , which, appropriately, stands for the Wonders of Womanhood. Many women received awards that night, and I want to acknowledge three from the electorate of Parramatta: Simran Gulati, who was most influential woman; Reshma Singh, who was most empowered woman; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Singh" rel="nofollow">
         Sonia Singh
        </a>
        , who won the power award. Again, it was a great night, with lots of women coming together to celebrate all their achievements and what they want out of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, at a United India Associations event, again in Parramatta and again with Sue Advani—she does seem to be everywhere!—an amazing group of women came together to raise money for a shelter for domestic violence victims. Again, they were amazing women. I want to thank them all and all of those who supported them in putting these great events together.
