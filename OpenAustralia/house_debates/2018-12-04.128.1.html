        has once again seen the benefits of the Liberal-National government's Stronger Communities Program in 2018. These local grants are helping some of our most important local organisations continue to do what they do bestâ€”helping our community. Noosa's volunteer coastguard is being assisted with $3,500 for new equipment, allowing it to rescue flooded boats, fight fires on the sea and deliver training programs. We gave over $17,000 to help develop a museum complex for the Maryborough Military Aviation Museum Association, commemorating those who served at

        Base Maryborough.

       <p>
        The amazing organisation Sunshine Butterflies was also given just over $17,000 to help them further develop their family centre facility, and I congratulate Leanne Walsh and her team for their amazing efforts. Thanks to our $4,800 contribution, the South Burnett First Aid Volunteers will be able to add disabled parking and wheelchair access to their Murgon training centre. Almost $18,000 will help Maryborough's popular FoodBasket service to purchase a new truck so they can continue to supply groceries to those in need and help our local people. We've helped out the Tin Can Bay
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , covering half of the $8,000 installation cost of the solar panels at their citizens' memorial hall. At the Tewantin-Noosa RSL we've contributed $5,000 to fund a memorial recognising the service of veterans within the community and reinforcing the Anzac legacy. The Cooloola Coast Medical Transport service needed two vehicles replaced, so we helped out with $15,000, helping them to continue to connect people with their medical appointments. We've contributed $2,500 to the Gympie Chamber of Commerce to buy needed equipment like screens, speakers and microphones for their monthly functions. Through the Stronger Communities Program, Maryborough's riding for the disabled association has been provided with over $17,000 for an arena rake, letting them create a perfectly level surface to provide a higher standard of safety for the kids. We supplied half of the $22,000 required to buy a new

         ATV
        </a>
        for the Peregian Beach Surf Life Saving Club, helping them to improve response times and keep the beach safe. We helped out Vinnies in Noosaville with over $7,500 for a solar power system. Hope Reins was granted nearly half of the $40,000 required to install the new hay shed, helping them to continue to offer their free programs to the Gympie community. Finally, we helped the Tin Can Bay Fishing Club with over $2,500 to cover their new security system.
