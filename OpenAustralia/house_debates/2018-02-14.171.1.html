       <p>
        I'm delighted and feel quite privileged to be able to rise to address this place in relation to this report as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Indigenous Affairs. At the outset, I would like to give the appropriate thanks to those who were involved in the very challenging work of putting such an impressive report together. It is entitled
        <i>
         The power
        </i>
        <i>
         of education: f
        </i>
        <i>
         rom surviving to thriving
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On that note, I pay tribute to our chair, the member for Durack, who I must say chaired proceedings in an efficient but also a very impressive manner in terms of keeping a large volume of evidence and information moving along; our deputy chair, the effervescent member for Lingiari; and of course, Madam Deputy Speaker, as the member for Newcastle. In my view, as very much a newcomer to this role, I was blown away by the depth of knowledge that you brought to the proceedings. I also acknowledge the other committee members and the secretariat, who played an invaluable role in ensuring things kept moving along so smoothly—Ms Brocklehurst, Ms Mazzarella, Ms Milligan and Ms Jones.
       </p>
       <p>
        My journey to having the privilege of being on this committee started a long way back. It actually started with a seminal moment in one's life, one of those forks in the road that steers one in a direction that one could never possibly anticipate, but in many ways it really was responsible for steering me here at this point in time. That related to the time and place when the
        <i>
         Bringing them home
        </i>
        report was released, in 1997-98, and it's apposite that we talk about this now in the context of the 10th anniversary of the apology to the stolen generation, particularly in relation to addressing the Closing the Gap targets.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will never forget walking into the office of Cedric Wyatt, who has now passed away, sadly. Cedric, for those who don't know, was then the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Aboriginal Affairs in the state of Western Australia and was also the very proud father of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Wyatt
        </a>
        , who is the current
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Treasurer of Western Australia
        </a>
        as well as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and, I'm very proud to say, a very firm, longstanding friend of mine. We used to knock around together in primary school. I went to Cedric to say, 'I'm interested in doing this paper at uni about this report that I've heard a bit about called
        <i>
         Bringing them home
        </i>
        . Is there any chance I could have a look at one?' He gave me a copy of this report. I read it from cover to cover at around the same time that I first saw our then leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Beazley
        </a>
        stand up in parliament, having read the document overnight, and being moved to tears about the nature and extent of the trauma suffered by the stolen generations as a result of their forced removal.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I didn't know then, and I subsequently learned, was Cedric himself was a member of the stolen generation. While he was a close family friend, I had never really appreciated not only the impact that being taken away had had on him personally but, again, that imperceptible level of trauma that filters down from generation to generation and that, in some special way, quite possibly drives Ben to want to effect the positive change that he does to this day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Analysing that report took me through the law to actually publishing a paper, because at that stage I had a question: what can we do to try and remedy this wrong? I knew instinctively that we had committed an irreparable level of harm on an entire race of people. I thought, 'We must do something to try and repair this damage.' At that stage in my life, I thought perhaps the answer was with the law. That took me to publishing a paper which was about trying to establish whether there was a fiduciary duty involved so that one could seek a remedy from the government, in so far as the establishment of the then inspectors or protectorates of Aboriginal people had a fiduciary relationship over the wards of the state. I fleshed out the fact that there might be a case there, or there might not be.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ironically, in 1998 many of those arguments were fleshed out in the litigation that became known as the Cubillo and Gunner litigation. It was at that stage where time, effectively, defeated the plaintiffs, not so far as the Limitations Act argument went but an equitable doctrine of laches, as it then applied. At that stage, again, it took me on the path of seeking justice for those who had been wronged, like the stolen generations, through the law. Ironically it took me over to cases that involved representing other Indigenous peoples who had been either dispossessed of land or dispossessed of entitlements, and over to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        to act on behalf of landowners against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        for the damage done to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_River" rel="nofollow">
         Fly River
        </a>
        in relation to the

         Ok Tedi
        </a>
        copper and gold mine.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I was being taken along the Fly River I was told by the landowners that the Fly River—it then had the colour and texture of a milky coffee—only 20 years before was so clear it looked like kerosene, in that you could see the bottom of the river without any trouble at all. The 50,000 land owners along the Fly River effectively had their economy taken away from them because they could no longer rely upon the river to sustain their market based subsistence. It is with some irony that I have the privilege in this place of being assigned responsibilities in the resources sector and I find myself dealing with the BHPs in this part of the world and managing those relationships.
       </p>
       <p>
        I then went over to represent landowners in Bougainville in the case against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto" rel="nofollow">
         Rio Tinto
        </a>
        , and again it was the same sort of thing. And at that stage in my life I thought that perhaps the answer to try and seek redress lay in the law, but it was clearly lacking in terms of its ability to deliver a meaningful remedy. That took me into this place in many ways. I had the great privilege of serving on this committee, and hearing the evidence from community leaders all over the country in relation to the ways in which the current system was failing them, and, more importantly, failing Aboriginal children, in so far as not landing the educational outcomes that were intended just to ensure that these kids had a level playing field.
       </p>
       <p>
        Madam Deputy Chair, you were there, and I suspect you recall as distinctly as I do, Wadeye—which is a community around 500 kilometres west of Darwin, and one of the largest communities in the country—at which a number of questions were asked of the principal. He was working his back side off like, everyone else there, in order to try and ensure that educational outcomes were delivered for these kids. The question was asked of the principal, 'How many kids are in the school?' There were 800 kids enrolled in the school; it was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph's
        </a>
        , I think, the only school in the community. Then questions were asked of the principle: 'Forget about the literature, the studies, the peer reviews and all that sort of stuff. In order to get these kids out of the school system with a reasonable degree of literacy and numeracy, how often do they need to be at school?' Well, the evidence was that they need to be at school perhaps 80 per cent of the time. When one thinks about that, that's every single week of your schooling life you're missing a day, so you're only getting to school for four days out of five. That's pretty significant, one thought to oneself—I certainly did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then the question was asked of the principal, 'That's all fine. So how many of your kids are hitting that mark so you can send them out?' The principal said it was about 20. One reasonably thought, 'That's about 20 per cent of 800,' so the question was asked, 'Is that 20 per cent?' and the answer was, 'No, that's 20 kids.' So we have a system right now where 20 children out of 800 are actually heading out the other end with just a workable degree of literacy and numeracy. The evidence given at that stage was that one of the fundamental issues was food security. Children in these communities are not getting enough to eat. They are vulnerable to substance abuse and there are all manner of ways in which the opportunities just to get ahead are circumvented by virtue of obstacles or roadblocks in the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was very clear in all of this and what is reflected in the report is that there is no silver bullet to ensuring educational outcomes are achieved for Aboriginal people. But one thing I know is this: what is very clear from my time in the law and my brief time having the privilege to serve in this place is that none of this will change as long as we think we need to fix things by doing things to Aboriginal people. What is very clear from this report about the way forward is that, whether we like it or not, if we are ever going to effect some form of meaningful change for our first-nation people, we need to stop thinking we know the answers. We need to face up to the reality that the Uluru Statement From the Heart, as indelicate and unfortunate as it might be in fitting into our current paradigm of doing things, perhaps is the way to go. It might just be the way to go because that was the recommendation of the first-nation people, and that has to be something we take forward.

        <p>
         I rise to speak on the educational opportunities for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         students and
         <i>
          The power of education: from surviving to thriving
         </i>
         . I acknowledge the traditional owners of these lands, the Ngunawal people, and their elders past and present and, in doing so, recommit myself to ending the scourge that is entrenched Aboriginal disadvantage. I also take this opportunity to specifically acknowledge the thorough and thoughtful work of the members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Standing Committee
         </a>
         on Indigenous Affairs and the secretariat staff, who put in an inordinate amount of time. I wasn't a member of this committee, but I have a reasonable interest in it given that I am from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         , where we have the highest urban Aboriginal population rate in the country and some of my high schools have a 20 per cent Aboriginal and first-nation student population. Recognition must go to the member for Hasluck and the member for Lingiari for their ongoing dedication and direction in this committee. It is important that we acknowledge their deep professional and personal connection which has helped shape a report that, while at times might be confronting, will help guide this House in its deliberations and policy direction—and goodness knows we need a lot of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, acknowledgement and thanks must go to everyone who took the time to make submissions and offer their thoughts to help guide the committee. This input is often made with the background of scant resources and, at times, imparting knowledge through traditional contexts, which are not always easy to explain and not always easy to put into words. It is done with passion, with compassion and with understanding. The committee has made a series of recommendations that have the capacity to not only improve our interactions within the confines of education but also increase the capacities of Indigenous communities overall. We know that education is the great leveller and we know that it's a game changer, and in Indigenous communities this couldn't be any more significant. It is important in rural and regional area has but also in urban settings, like in my electorate of Lindsay.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the outset, I note that the chair has stated it is essential that Indigenous students and their families be able to choose from a range of well-supported options for secondary education, public and independent, within their local region and further afield should they choose. This is a particularly relevant statement for Indigenous students, their families and the teaching staff involved. It came as no surprise to me that the committee raised concerns regarding the lack of reliable data on the students' achievements. It is critical that we improve and that the government improves the methods of data collection, and not just through standardised testing. The data is critical to guide education professionals, community workers and communities themselves. I raise this issue as a member of parliament who, as I said, lives in a region with the highest population of urban settlement of Aboriginal people. It is vital that all of us can identify the issues and develop specific policies that address inequality, effectively helping to close that very stubborn gap.
        </p>
        <p>
         Addressing cultural safety is vital in maintaining connection to people's communities. There is the recommendation that training in how to teach people for whom English is a second language or dialect be made a compulsory component for teachers whether they are completing their degrees or already working in schools. I note that every time we hear this Prime Minister give an address in relation to first nations people, he does so in traditional language. I would implore him to listen half as much as he speaks in relation to first nations and first nation voices. I specifically call out the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is to the committee's credit that they recognise that it should be treated as a matter of urgency to make it compulsory to train teachers in teaching people for whom English is a second dialect.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data retention, collation and availability will also assist educators and policymakers alike. The fact that the committee has acknowledged and raised serious concerns regarding the significant disparity about accessibility and funding for engagement between boys and girls is deeply concerning. We spent some time in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         late last year, and met the Tangentyere Women's Family Safety Group. We know that the effects of family violence in these communities are incredibly difficult. We know that women are more likely to be affected. The committee has rightly stated that girls are the mothers and carers of the next generation—without being too stereotypical—it's a fact of life; women carry babies and it is our predominant responsibility to care for them. The women are actually our future, and these girls are not getting access to the education. So there is concern regarding the focus on sports based programs. While they can be effective at engaging boys, these programs should not be regarded as the only hook for increasing participation and attendance. Certainly in my electorate we do see that a fair bit too.
        </p>
        <p>
         I agree with the committee that encouragement and funding equality for girls and the promotion of art, cultural education and gender and culturally specific education programs is a whole-of-community outcome. It won't just affect or impact or make better the lives of first nations people; it's something that will make better the lives of every Australian. The report correctly identifies this as a matter of urgency. I would implore the government to get on with these recommendations and the implementation around them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have noted the committee has identified the need for cultural training for teachers and recognises that one size fits all is not the answer. When I was a university student I famously had a university lecturers come in and play the song 'Another brick in the wall', by Pink Floyd, encouraging us as educators not to take the one-size-fits-all approach, and that is still relevant to me now—less than 20 years later, without giving away how old I actually am.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee rightfully identifies and clarifies that tailoring the needs of disparate communities often requires a less formative approach that allows educators to tailor programs in specific areas. That's what we would have set out as the Labor government to do with the Gonski funding as well. This has the added advantage of helping address wellbeing and health, and aids that assist teachers as they strive for cultural understanding, better awareness and a better way of integrating that into a very formal curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also significant that the committee's report addresses the urgent need for Indigenous culture to be included in teaching degrees. Support should be provided to teachers in communities with a high number of Indigenous students to ensure they have appropriate skills to learn language, culture and history. And I want to give a shout-out to Kristine MacPhail, the principal at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Park_High_School" rel="nofollow">
          Cambridge Park High School
         </a>
         . Every year, she never fails to ensure that Aboriginal students in her school are recognised through her active and energised participation in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">
          NAIDOC
         </a>
         Week. It's always my great pleasure to go along and have wattleseed pancakes and to participate in the special Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander celebrations of that week. It is an absolute honour to do so and it is a credit to the school for allowing that to happen. Also
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Chisholm" rel="nofollow">
          Caroline Chisholm
         </a>
         , my former school, a Catholic school, has an Aboriginal advisory group, which is headed up by their students, by the kids that this impacts, and they are making gains and they are striving in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes we can falter, though, in our enthusiasm to improve our approach to education, not only educationally but institutionally. If organisations receive funding, they ought to be producing results. While we strive to reach for answers, sometimes we might fall short. I do applaud the committee's recommendation that highlights the Queensland government's findings into direct instruction. To give the children the best start possible despite the hurdles, disparate curriculums sometimes do not meet community expectations. In the search to tailor for specific community needs, we require community accountability. It is hoped that the review into this program provides significant insight, and I urge the government to act on the committee's funding recommendation to expedite any action that is required.
        </p>
        <p>
         We turn to the need now for flexibility, and the recognition that displacement from your community is difficult and it is fraught. Attending a boarding school affects every child, regardless of their circumstance. It is especially difficult for first nation kids. In this place, we need to imagine a world where English can be at times your second or third language. We need to acknowledge the cultural shock that people from remote and even urban communities will experience when attending boarding schools. The recommendations by this committee to establish dedicated public accommodation as close as practicable to where it is needed will surely assist those children affected by sudden changes. A broad strategy to ensure that cultural, health and wellbeing standards are met is a laudable goal.
        </p>
        <p>
         You might be surprised that these comments are just as relevant in Western Sydney as they are in rural and regional and remote areas. I acknowledge that education is primarily the responsibility of state governments but, federally, we can ensure that people needing to travel or requiring assistance to further their studies are encouraged and not thwarted. In respect of ABSTUDY funding, it is clear the government has dropped the ball on this. As with Centrelink, procedures regarding the facilitation, certainty and—most importantly—confidence that a child will be able to continue their studies are vital to ensuring that inclusion, not exclusion, is our goal. I commend this report and I commit myself to continuing advocacy for those people who need a voice here.
