       <p>
        I rise to congratulate and pay tribute to the exceptional Lindsay residents who were recognised on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        honour roll this year.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order" rel="nofollow">
         The Order
        </a>
        of Australia is the highest national honour awarded to Australian citizens for exceptional service and achievements. I'd like to take the opportunity to recognise the amazing Lindsay recipients.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bateman" rel="nofollow">
         John Bateman
        </a>
        was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for service to local government and to the community of Nepean, recognising his dedication and service to our community serving as the Mayor of Penrith from September 1998 to September 2000. Mr Bateman now gives a lot of his time volunteering for our community and has a strong belief in the benefits of volunteering. He established the Bateman Battersby law bursary, which supports students to undertake legal studies and, is the founder of the Nepean Philanthropists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neville Barnier was awarded the OAM for service to people with a disability and to the community of Penrith, and this commendation is in recognition of his volunteerism. Neville has been involved in the Australian Foundation for Disability, Afford, for over 30 years and was chairman from 2014 to 2017. He has also supported the Penrith

        </a>
        and Homes for Heroes, in the western region. This award is very well deserved, and Neville is a valued member of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to make mention of another valued member of our wider Lindsay community,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Fish

         Erskine Park
        </a>
        , who was awarded the Order of Australia for service to veterans and their families. Albert has served our community and veterans through his work with the St Mary's RSL sub-branch, the St Mary's Women's Auxiliary and the Vietnam Veterans Association. I thank all three of these gentlemen and congratulate them on their achievements.
