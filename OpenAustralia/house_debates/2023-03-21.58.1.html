        My question is to the Minister for Housing. How will the Housing Australia Future Fund benefit Australians? How has it been received by stakeholders? Why is it so important for it to pass the parliament as soon as possible?

         I thank the member for

          McEwen

         for this important question. He knows that too many Australians at the moment are making difficult decisions around the kitchen table. They're dealing with increasing interest rates. They're dealing with rising rents. And they're making some tough decisions, which is why it is astounding that those opposite continue to oppose our Housing Australia Future Fund. They oppose the Housing Australia Future Fund, a reform that will deliver thousands of new social and affordable homes right across Australia for people that need them most. Fortunately they sat alone when this House passed our bill, with broad support from MPs across this House, including of course the member for Bass, who supported this important legislation.

           <p>
            Last week, housing experts from across academia, industry and community gave their views to a Senate committee on our housing package. PowerHousing Australia described it as 'transformative reform' that will enable the housing needs of more Australians to be met. When asked if the Senate should move quickly to support the package, the Community Housing Industry Association declared it was 'absolutely urgent'. They said, 'We have to put something in place right now.' The Urban Development Institute said, 'Every day that passes is costing them more and more.' The Property Council said, 'The quicker all of these mechanisms are up and running the better.' National Shelter described it as 'the most critical housing legislation to be brought forward for the past 10 years'. That's what people are saying about our Housing Australia Future Fund and our legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have done more in our first 10 months than those opposite did in almost 10 years, particularly when it comes to social and affordable housing. Our Housing Accord will combine state and federal funding to deliver another 20,000 affordable homes over five years from 2024. We've unlocked up to $575 million immediately from the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, and construction is underway on these homes around Australia. We're working with the states and territories on the future of the $1.6 billion each year under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. Work is already underway on a National Housing and Homelessness Plan. We'll implement our Help to Buy Scheme, the shared equity scheme. We brought forward the Regional Home Buyer Guarantee, which is already helping thousands of Australians into homeownership.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course the Industry Super Association just today have said:

           <p class="italic">
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISA" rel="nofollow">
             ISA
            </a>
            urges the Senate to support the HAFF and the once-in-a-generation opportunity it provides to reform investment in social and affordable housing.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are urging the Senate to pass this legislation. Our broad reforms to housing are critical, and I would say to those opposite and to the senators: Australians that need it most need this bill to be passed, and they need it passed quickly.
