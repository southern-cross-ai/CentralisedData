        As I was saying before, there are certain areas of certain parts of the country that just excel in certain things. I can tell everyone right now that the Clarence Valley Triathlon Club excels in its chosen sport. The club competed in the popular

         Trial Bay
        </a>
        triathlon a few weeks ago, and there were some stunning results. Darren Adams was 22nd overall in the 45- to 49-year-olds. Brian Elvery was first in the 50- to 55-year-olds. Kim Elvery was second in the 55- to 59-year-olds—a very talented family there. Jane Wilson was second in the 40- to 45-year-olds. Roz Donohoe was third in the 55- to 59-year-olds. Penny Elvery was fourth in the 15- to 19-year-olds—so a family thing coming through there.

        I congratulate the Clarence Valley Triathlon Club for their successful trip to the Trial Bay triathlon a few weekends ago. We all know that part of the health of someone is looking after themselves physically, as well as in other areas. These people are an inspiration not only to the Clarence Valley community but also to the wider community for the effort they are putting in and their fantastic results. I congratulate everyone in the Clarence Valley Triathlon Club for that effort.
