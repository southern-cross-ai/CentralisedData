        TINK () (): When I was running for the seat of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , an idea emerged from our community that we could be one of the first net zero urban energy zones in the country, meaning homes across my electorate would have reduced household expenses and healthier, cleaner and environments to live in. The successful election result enabled an incredible significantly experienced volunteer team to come together to develop a fully fledged strategy and plan to assist our community in achieving and establishing this goal. To everyone involved in that team: please know that the wider community and I will be forever grateful for both your commitment and the work that you have done in this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        From that beginning, and in collaboration with North Sydney,

        and Willoughby local councils and other key stakeholders from the business, not-for-profit and community sectors, next weekend, on Sunday 2 April, we will start this important work at our first ever Clean Energy Community Fair. Taking place at Norths leagues club from 10 am, the free event will be family friendly and will include some fantastic speakers; interactive and interesting exhibitions, including electric bikes and vehicles; and even face painting for anyone who would like it. I give special thanks to the teams at Smart Energy Council, Norths leagues club and the local councils that have worked with us, hand in hand, to make this event possible. It is certain to be a fantastic day, and I look forward to seeing our community make this transition quickly.
