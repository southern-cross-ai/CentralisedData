        I'm very proud that Corinda State High School in my electorate of Moreton has been accredited as the first carbon-neutral education institution in Queensland. It's not easy to get this accreditation. An organisation must measure emissions, reduce them where possible, offset remaining emissions and publicly report on their carbon neutrality. That's quite a commitment for a state education facility to undertake, let alone achieve. I applaud the school and, in particular, the leadership of the principal, Helen Jamieson. We talked together back in 1988 in Babinda up in

        . She's a wonderful example to her students. Helen and her staff and students are taking action to address climate change, even when our country's leaders are not. The students at Corinda State High School understand that it is their future that is at risk. In their own way, they've taken matters into their own hands. I applaud their initiative, but of course we need those who have the power to make broader changes. Unless we get some real leadership on climate change now, today's schoolchildren will be looking at catastrophic scenarios by the time they're facing middle age. We expect the occupants of this parliament to lead by example, but the students of Corinda State High School and their staff and parents are turning that on its head. Corinda State High School students and teachers are setting the example for this parliament to follow. I hope all of those opposite who care about the future and anyone who has children will be doing the right thing. Have a look at Corinda State High School and what they're doing. I hope that you will encourage schools in your electorates to do the same thing and be carbon-neutral education institutions.
