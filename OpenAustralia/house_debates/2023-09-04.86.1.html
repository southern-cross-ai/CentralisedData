           I thank my friend and colleague the member for Jagajaga for that question because she at the last election promised cheaper medicines to her community, and in just our first 12 months we have delivered three waves of cheaper medicines reforms, which are saving hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for those patients. On Friday we delivered the fourth wave, allowing almost four million Australian patients to ask their doctor for a 60-day script for almost a hundred common medicines for ongoing health conditions, things like heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and much more. Two scripts for the price of one are effectively halving the cost of medicines for almost four million Australians. This isn't just good for their hip pocket, because we know from overseas evidence it's also good for their health, improving medication compliance by as much as 20 per cent.

               That's why so many other countries have been doing this for years, and that's why every doctors group, every patient group, has strongly supported the policy of 60-day scripts.

              <p>
               But I'm asked who stood in the way of this policy. Well, five years ago those opposite stood in the way of cheaper medicines by refusing to accept exactly the same advice from the medicines experts as we received last summer.

                   Just two things, Mr Speaker. The first is that was clearly an abuse of a point of order. Secondly, the deputy leader has already been warned.

                              Order! I'm going to ask the House to be silent. The member for Warringah was raising a point about conduct within the House. I warned those in the gallery early in question time today that they were not to participate and were not to interject during question time. As a result of their behaviour, they have left the chamber, but I want to say this going forward: there will be no interjections from the gallery. There will be no movement noise from the gallery, out of respect for this parliament but also the other Australians that are in the gallery. For the rest of this week and for the rest of the time that I'm Speaker, that will not happen again. The member has been asked to withdraw a reflection. I'm going to ask her to do that.

                               I respect that. I simply want to draw your attention to the fact that what the member for Warringah did was draw your attention to conduct of members. That's different to name-calling or what is normally considered a reflection on members. If it is impossible to even take a point of order reflecting on the conduct and drawing to the attention of the chair the conduct of speakers, then a whole lot of points of order can't be taken. What the member for Warringah did is a completely legitimate way of drawing the attention of the chair to how members are behaving. That can't be considered a reflection.

                                     Amid all of that what is clear is that these savings the Leader of the Opposition was determined to do everything possible to block. Well, we're just as determined to back patients in right to the hilt. We are determined for there to be a vibrant future for the community pharmacy sector. That is why we're reinvesting every single dollar the Commonwealth saves from this measure, and that is why, as I said in an earlier answer, we've agreed to bring forward the negotiation of the next funding agreement with the sector, with the aim of getting an agreement by 1 March. Ultimately, be clear about this: from our perspective good health policy is about the interests of patients, and that is what cheaper medicines deliver.
