        I am very glad that everyone managed to get here despite the debacle presented to us. Recently in my electorate we have had local council elections, and I want to thank everybody who had the courage to stand for election. We in this place know the pressure that that brings. I want to thank all those who have retired, commiserate with those who did not get elected and congratulate all those who were successful.

        In Latrobe, on the eastern end of my province, Mayor Michael Gaffney has been returned, along with Dayna Dennison, Peter Freshney,

        My congratulations go to everyone. Again, I thank everyone who stood and I thank those who have served in the past and have retired. I congratulate those who have been elected for the first time, including Shane Broad from my office. I know he will do a fantastic job in my constituencyâ€”and he had better fix the footpaths in my local village if he wants to keep his job. Congratulations to everyone and commiserations to those who missed out.
