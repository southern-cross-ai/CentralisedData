       <p class="italic">
        (c) as a global problem, the solution to climate change requires concerted international cooperation to limit the production of greenhouse gasses;

         Paris Accords
        </a>
        must play a central role in addressing climate change;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the Paris Accords require signatory countries to deliver actions consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) based on the latest scientific advice, the world is currently on track for warming of above 3 degrees, and efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts; and

       <p class="italic">
        (g) as a result of the threat posed by climate change, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Portugal, Argentina and the Republic of Ireland have declared a climate emergency; and

        8   Mr Katter: To move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that the Australian dairy industry is facing decimation as a result of the failure of government deregulation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) successive governments have contributed to failure in the dairy industry and that the dairy industry will continue its decline if policy is driven by ideology;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the time is up for our Australian dairy industry with national herds being sold for slaughter, farm foreclosures and employees now trapped in destitution in rural towns;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) in Queensland, the number of dairy farms has dropped from 1305 in 2000-01 to 393 in 2017-18;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Australia had 12,896 dairy farms in the year 2000 and as of 2018 there were just 5699, a reduction of 57 per cent;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) farmers are, in general, not receiving the full 10 cent levy promised by the supermarkets; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) in 2001-02 our national herd produced 11.3 billion litres of whole milk, and in 2017-18 Australia produced 8.8 billion litres, a 22 per cent reduction of 2.5 billion litres; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) reintroduce the minimum price scheme, which delivered orderly marketing and fairness for nearly a century to Australia's farmers, contractors and employees; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) secure from supermarket chains a 25 cent price rise (since they are able to set a 10 cent price rise), and oversee the mechanics of ensuring that this 25 cents goes back to the farm gate.
