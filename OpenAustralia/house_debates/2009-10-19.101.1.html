        I rise to speak tonight, a week after the seventh anniversary of the Bali bombings, which took the lives of 202 people in the tourist district of Kuta on 12 October 2002. In this cowardly act of terrorism, among the dead were 88 Australians, many of whom were from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , holidaying in Bali. Many other tourists and Indonesian residents were injured in the attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Monday at dawn, I stood beside my state parliamentary colleagues, the families, the friends, the survivors and the supporters who were affected by the terrorist attacks on 12 October 2002 and also those affected by the bombings in 2005. This annual gathering takes place on the anniversary at a specially designed Bali Memorial in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Kings Park
        </a>
        . Community support for the annual service has continued to grow and it is a sign of the Australian spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Out of this tragedy, the relationship between Australia and Indonesia has strengthened, and we stand by them as they face further challenges ahead. Western Australia in particular has established strong trading relationships with Indonesia in areas such as agriculture and mining. And although there has been a drop in tourists visiting the island of Bali, more and more Australians are now starting to head back and are not letting this terrorist act deter them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the work of one particular organisation based in Western Australia—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bali Peace Park
        </a>
        Association. The association has a mission to create a spiritual garden on the ex-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Sari Club
        </a>
        site, where the attacks took place. The garden will allow people to reflect on and acknowledge the events of 12 October and it will look to help build a future without fear by promoting tolerance, understanding and freedom for generations to come, irrespective of nationality, culture, religious belief or race.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support the work and the mission that this organisation is committed to delivering in honour of those killed in the attacks. A committee has been set up to drive and coordinate this project, and I would like to acknowledge a few of those people. The Bali Peace Park Association’s spokesperson, Phil Britten, was one of the many injured in the bombings and suffered third-degree burns to around 60 per cent of his body. He also sadly lost many of his close friends in the attack. Phil and his wife, Rebecca, both sit on the committee. Phil is an inspiration to us all and is now a motivational speaker on his experiences and his journey.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Nash" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Nash
        </a>
        , vice chairman of the association, is also a survivor. Gary suffered burns to over 51 per cent of his body, as well as suffering shrapnel wounds that will see him having to wear pressure garments on his legs for the rest of his life. His partner, Sharon Kermac, is also sitting on the committee as treasurer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased to see representatives from the Kingsley Football Club also involved in the association. This local football club in Western Australia was deeply affected by the bombings and lost many of its loyal young clubmen during the attacks, while the boys were on their end of season footy trip.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge one of the patrons of the Bali Peace Association, Dr Fiona Wood. Dr Wood is known as the ‘burns specialist’ and heads up the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Perth_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Perth Hospital
        </a>
        burns unit and the Western Australia Burns Service. Dr Wood, who was Australian of the Year in 2005, worked with many of the injured during the Bali bombings and led a courageous and committed team.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bali Peace Park Association was incorporated on 2 September and is an established not-for-profit organisation. I support the association’s efforts to seek a special application for deductible gift recipient status from the government. This would allow for donations to be declared as a tax deduction for Australian residents. Efforts to raise the necessary funds for this project will be made easier this way. If you are listening, Mr Swan, please have this processed as soon as possible. I did promise the association that I would ask you this. I see the Assistant Treasurer in the House tonight and I would ask him as well.

          You did such a good job; I thought you were still in that position. Well, pass the message on for me. It is anticipated that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Bali Peace Park
          </a>
          will be handed over to the Balinese community and the local government to manage and to maintain, once it has been set up by the association. A peace park or spiritual garden will provide the district of Kuta with many benefits beyond just a unique tourist attraction. Local jobs will be created not only during the construction and development of the park but also in the ongoing maintenance of the park, with security, cleaners and landscape staff.
         </p>
         <p>
          As we remember and reflect on the events of the Bali bombings seven years later, we should recognise how far our two countries have come and acknowledge how much we still have to offer one another. As a nation, we will know further tragedies but we will never lose our spirit or forget this tragic event in Australian history.
