        I rise to advise the House about three remarkable members of the Bennelong community who received awards in this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day Honours
        </a>
        . All are committed members of our local community and have been duly recognised for their volunteering and advocacy work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Moya Potts has just been awarded an AM for her role as the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Women's_League" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Women's League
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . This volunteer group raises money to support vulnerable women and families locally and across the globe. The organisation addresses social and moral issues as well as promoting values and equality in the areas of health, education and economic and social welfare. Mrs Potts joined the organisation in the 1970s, when she was inspired by members of the group. After all these years, she still says it is the people she meets that inspire her most. Under her leadership, the league has supported many well-known charities including Chris Riley's Youth Off The Streets, Pregnancy Help and the Mary Mackillop Outreach. Together they have helped thousands of young people, women and their families in times of hardship and struggle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Monica Saville is a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Epping and has spent much of the last two decades volunteering locally and around the globe. Her significant contributions to helping people have just been recognised with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        in the recent Australia Day Honours. Mrs Saville is currently the trustee and treasurer of the Australian Rotary Foundation Trust but has held most of the available positions since she joined the local Rotary Club in 1993, including serving as the first female president.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a child, Mrs Saville contracted polio and has subsequently been a tireless volunteer to prevent its spread around the world, including administering polio vaccines to children by torchlight in India. She also manages Rotary's Youth Driver Awareness Program and their local debating competitions. Mrs Saville's considerable compassion and experience has been felt across the north-west of Sydney, and there are many people worldwide who have had their lives positively changed by her kind actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even closer to home for me, I would be remiss if I did not also mention a fantastic volunteer from the area who also happens to be my cousin.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Alexander" rel="nofollow">
         Susan Alexander
        </a>
        received an OAM for her tireless work in child protection for nearly six decades. This includes three decades with the children's welfare department and subsequent time volunteering with incredible organisations like Marist Youth Care and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_Stone" rel="nofollow">
         Stepping Stone
        </a>
        . She is a wonderful person and one of the most generous members of the local community and my family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure everyone in this place will join me in congratulating all of these remarkable women for their contributions to Bennelong and the broader society and for receiving their well-earned recognition.
