       <p>
        I rise this afternoon to talk about the Northern Light Theatre Company's performance of
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas" rel="nofollow">
          White Christmas
         </a>
        </i>
        . As patron of the Northern Light Theatre Company, having been asked to be their patron a few weeks ago, I thought it was appropriate that I should go and have a look at how well they perform, and indeed they did just that. The performance was at the Shedley Theatre and they performed to a packed house at the end of two weeks of solid performances almost every day. The music, the acting, the costumes, the script, the lighting and the performances of the individuals were all superb and enjoyed by everyone. This is an amateur theatre company and, as members can appreciate, not very well resourced and relying very much on volunteers in terms of the performers, the costume makers, the set designers and so on. They proved to be as professional as any professional outfit ever would be.
       </p>
       <p>
        I certainly commend and congratulate everyone involved in the production of
        <i>
         White Christmas
        </i>
        . I look forward to going along and seeing some of their other performances. They tend to be a group that do not perform that often, but when they do they put 100 per cent into the performance so they can ensure that the community get value for their money. Once again, I commend everyone involved in the production of
        <i>
         White Christmas
        </i>
        .
