       <p>
        As this government knows, one of the biggest drivers of jobs and growth is investment in infrastructure. In my electorate of Hume, there is a strong case in point. The federal government has committed over $100 million into Hume infrastructure projects in the past two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am going to read out a bit of a list here. Forty-four million dollars has been invested in Roads to Recovery, supporting local council road projects in Hume, and we are seeing the real impacts from a number of those projects. Just under $20 million from the National Stronger Regions Fund last year has gone to projects at Goulburn, Murrumbateman and Harden. Eleven million has been spent on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Barton Highway
        </a>
        through safety works projects, and a further $12 million has been committed. Thirteen million has been invested through the bridges renewal and road black spot programs up to the end of 2015. We heralded this year another $3.7 million from round 2 of the Bridges Renewal Program. We received $2 million under the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program up to October last year, and a further $3 million has been invested by the Commonwealth in 18 mobile phone black spot towers in Hume—and the first of those are starting to go up now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, we have also secured funding from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government and telecommunications companies for these towers, costing a total of $10 million across the electorate. There is enormous investment—it is hard to quantify in dollar terms—in Hume's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout. This includes the laying of fibre in many major town centres and the building of more than 50 fixed wireless towers across the electorate. A good portion of those are up and running now.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is coming good on infrastructure investment for regional Australia and the jobs are flowing. I have heard from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Employment
        </a>
        that 1,150 new job placements were made in Hume since the federal government's jobactive program started in July last year. We are seeing confidence in investment converting into real jobs and real opportunities. What also makes the Hume story great is the extraordinary response we have received to government grant programs that are building real community spirit. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Green Army
        </a>
        , the Safer Streets Program, the Stronger Communities Program and the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program have all had a wonderful response in my electorate. It is a real privilege to be able to help little groups like the Frogmore Hall and Recreation Reserve Trust near Boorowa, who have been successful in securing $1,300 for a plaque and flagpole, or work with the Tahmoor Soccer Club to win $5,000 for new goalposts. This government is investing in infrastructure, big and small, and communities across my electorate are seeing the benefits.
