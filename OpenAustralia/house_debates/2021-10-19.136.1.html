        State School has continued to grow and build from strength to strength. The school culture continues to evolve on their foundation of positive relationships and high expectations for all members of the school community. The impact of this cultural change is highlighted by the student learning outcomes. There has been a real opportunity to celebrate, as the data shows that more students are passing English than ever before.
       </p>
       <p>
        The teachers are implementing high-yield strategies that are clearly making a difference to every student, every day, and helping them soar to great success. The staff have developed a process of intentionally focusing on every student. This is called faces on their data walls, and is looking for the next best step for each child. Teachers are walking beside their students as lifelong learners, developing their craft to deliver quality teaching and learning through innovative, differentiated learning experiences for the students.
       </p>
       <p>
        They see this as their greatest achievement. The staff have strong relationships and work as a team, from collaborative planning days all the way to classroom teaching and learning. Edens Landing State School has also been driven to create a wonderful environment in which students can learn. New playgrounds, sports equipment, grounds beautification and general facility upgrades have provided students and staff with a renewed pride in their school. The creation of a new school mascot, '

        ', a six-foot tall rainbow lorikeet, leads the charge for positive behaviour for learning and engagement in school life.
       </p>
       <p>
        This increase in student results, increased attendance and reduced numbers of negative behaviours are all outcomes of having great people with a community focus at the heart of what they do. It is obvious the school is much loved within the community when you see the foundation students enrolling their own children into prep, to start their education journey, at Edens Landing State School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three staff members have also been acknowledged and celebrated at a state level for their amazing work at Edens Landing.

She was nominated for and has won the Excellence in Teaching Award and is now a state finalist in the 2021 TEACHX Awards, the Dr Alan Druery
