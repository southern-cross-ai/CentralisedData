        I rise with considerable delight, having found out from the member for Banks here in the House this evening about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        roller derby team. He gave a most eloquent explanation of how the sport works and I have just met him in the corridor on the way here and found out that the Central Coast are at the top of the table. That is another thing to be proud about from the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of my remarks this evening are celebratory of fantastic things that have been happening in the seat of Robertson just over the weekend. Saturday morning I was at the Five Lands awakening ceremony where Gavi Duncan played didgeridoo for us as the dawn rose and we awakened the spirits in anticipation of the Five Lands Walk, which is a cultural, social and health walk that happens between McMasters Beach and Terrigal, right along the coast, inspired by the Cinquaterra from Italy. It is a chance for our local people to really go and have a fantastic family free day, experiencing Indigenous culture, our own natural wonderful environment and also the multicultural communities. That is how we kicked that off on Saturday morning. Leading that were Con Ryan and Pauline Wright. I want to acknowledge Pauline Wright, who has been nominated for the Pride of Australia Community Spirit Medal. I could not think of a finer woman. She is a great Central Coast leader in her own right through her profession as a lawyer. She articulates her passions as civil liberties and theatre, and obviously she uses those skills to great acclaim and great success in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having started off the day in such a wonderful way, I was able to finish Saturday afternoon with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bays" rel="nofollow">
         The Bays
        </a>
        , which is part of my seat that wraps around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        Bay and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phegans_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Phegans Bay
        </a>
        . Over the last few years, in fact over 13 years I understand, the whole of the bay—Woy Woy Bay and Phegans Bay—from the settlement through to 1960 has been researched and a wonderful book launch happened at the local community hall in Phegans Bay, Woy Woy Bay. The book was entitled
        <i>
         Our Beautiful Bays: A Collection From the Past
        </i>
        . It is filled with wonderful images and stories and pieces of writing about people's responses as they came on the train from Sydney and, after passing through the Woy Woy tunnel, seeing such a beautiful sight of a clear expanse of sparkling water bounded by the natural amphitheatre of the mountains that cradle Woy Woy Bay and Phegans Bay. A number of the Phegans were there and there were many happy relationships rekindled by all of those who have lived in the bay. Those who have moved away came back to celebrate on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the work of two great local historians: Margaret Vidler, who did much of the research herself over many years, and Brian Goodey, who pulled the book together in the last few years. I also want to acknowledge the guidance given by Gwen Dundon, who was one of our outstanding local historians who was recognised at our inaugural heritage awards at the council a couple of weeks ago. The book was very well read by Geoff Potter, who gave us a taste of that view of The Bays as people came out of the tunnel at Woy Woy Bay. I also congratulate Gwynneth Weir, the secretary of The Bays community group, who pulled together the event. It was very well attended and it was a celebration worthy of the efforts that have been put into record the history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in the time that remains, I would like to also acknowledged that on Sunday afternoon I was able to be at yet another book launch of these wonderful, literate Central Coast residents. The launch was for
        <i>
         A taste of Spencer
        </i>
        . It was from a group called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS" rel="nofollow">
         KISS
        </a>
        group—Keep It Simple Spencer. This is a community cooking collective who get together to preserve the produce from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Mangrove Mountain
        </a>
        , and also to share food and great company. I acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Diane Williams
        </a>
        ; Margy Rogers; Judy Betteridge, who gave a great speech and pulled the thing together; Lisa Perkins; Eve Leeming; Sue Grist; Kaye Pointer; Margerey Pointer; Michael Bagnall; Mel Bradney; and Ian Betteridge. A great afternoon at Spencer. I invite many people to come along—
