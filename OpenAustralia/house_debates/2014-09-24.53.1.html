       <p>
        I am very pleased to rise to congratulate the staff and students of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urrbrae_Agricultural_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Urrbrae Agricultural High School
        </a>
        in my electorate for their recent winning entries in the Anzac Day Schools' Awards. Urrbrae is unique in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and is recognised as a centre of excellence in agriculture, technology and the environment. The school has ongoing partnerships with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and the University of Adelaide, and I cannot speak highly enough about the fantastic learning opportunities they give their students.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this instance, the school has been recognised for its efforts to ensure the Anzac legacy lives on. Mr David Kempe and his Year 10 students recently conducted a project to research the history of Urrbrae students who lost their lives in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        and to restore the school's Anzac Memorial Grove. This project was not only a wonderful learning experience for those students; it will benefit all those who come after them. They will now be able to hear the stories of the Urrbrae alumni who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recognition of their efforts, I recently visited the school to speak to the students and present them with awards, plaques and a cheque for $1,500, as the runner-up secondary school in South Australia and the national winner in the best local history research category in the Anzac Day Schools' Awards. I also visited the grove, which stretches across the entire length of the school oval. My congratulations again to Urrbrae. The staff and students should be very proud of their school's efforts and of their hard work and dedication to learning about and honouring our Anzacs.
