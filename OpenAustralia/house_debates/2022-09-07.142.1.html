        Last night in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollondilly_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Wollondilly Shire
        </a>
        , just outside of Picton, five teenagers lost their lives in a single motor vehicle accident. These five teenagers attended Picton High School. We don't know all of their names, but I want to extend my condolences to the families involved, and to say to them all—and to the first responders—my heart goes out to you. The roads of Wollondilly have been difficult to maintain during the recent flood and high-rainfall events, and I met with Matt Gould, the mayor of Wollondilly, to see what we could do to help in the repairs. We don't know the cause of the accident. It is an absolute tragedy, and I know the whole community of Wollondilly will be severely impacted by this event. The high schools, the primary schools and the first responders—the police, the ambulance drivers and the emergency services workers—will all be severely impacted, as will our local health services, and I send my condolences and thoughts to all of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wollondilly is just outside my electorate boundaries, but my wife and I lived there for almost 40 years. We raised our family there, and we're familiar with all the local people, the local schools, the local teachers and the first responders. I know that most of the first responders would live in the area of Wollondilly, and they will be traumatised, I am sure, by this event. Superintendent Paul Fuller from the Camden area command described the scene as horrific, and I'm sure that was the case. I possibly cared for some of the children involved. To their families: I cannot even begin to say how much sorrow I feel and how much I grieve for you. This was a terrible event that will effect the Wollondilly Shire and the wider Macarthur and Hume electorates as well, and I send my condolences to everyone involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        We seldom think about the first responders and the horrific scenes they are forced to witness. If you can imagine a single vehicle accident with five dead teenagers—it is just beyond comprehension. This is a tragedy for the whole community and for the wider community, and I wish there was something that I could do that would turn back time to before the accident, but I can't. We will have to grieve, with the whole Wollondilly community. I extend to Matt Gould, the mayor of Wollondilly, my offer of support in any way that it can be given to them, and I thank the first responders.

         could add a few words from the electorate of Lalor to the electorate of Macarthur: these tragedies are extraordinary. They take an extraordinary toll over many, many years; it's not just the initial response. From my electorate to yours, we send our best.
