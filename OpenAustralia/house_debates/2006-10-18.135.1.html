       <p>
        Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—In the absence of the chair and on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee’s 16th, 17th and 18th reports of 2006. The 16th report of 2006 addresses the provision of facilities for Project Single Living Environment and Accommodation Precinct—phase one, at an estimated cost of $406 million. This project is the second public-private partnership that has come under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project proposes to provide 1,295 permanent rooms and the provision of infrastructure and ancillary support services for a period of 30 years across three sites:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

        at Enoggera in Queensland and

         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley, also in Queensland. The project goes some way to addressing the current shortfall of bed spaces of appropriate standards for single services personnel and includes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         financing the development of the facilities and services;
        </li>
        <li>
         a commissioned and fully operational living-in-accommodation service, together with all associated furniture and equipment, parking, storage and facilities;
        </li>
        <li>
         all required infrastructure, including upgrading engineering services and other utilities;
        </li>
        <li>
         ongoing operation including repair and maintenance; and
        </li>
        <li>
         supply and conduct of the accommodation services for the facilities including those provided by the strategic partner and those sourced through existing Garrison Support Service and Comprehensive Maintenance Service contracts.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The committee investigated all aspects of the work, paying particular attention to project cost, consultation, project delivery and project implementation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the complexity of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPP" rel="nofollow">
         PPP
        </a>
        —public-private partnership—arrangement for this project, the committee requested an additional confidential briefing to ensure that the details of the expected costs for the project represented value for money for the Commonwealth. Another issue for the committee was that it faced the challenge of considering a project before its final form is known. As a result, the committee recommends that Defence provide it with regular reports on the progress of works as well as a briefing on the final form of the project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of this proposal involves the demolition of existing buildings. The committee heard that 175 buildings within Gallipoli Barracks contained asbestos and was assured that it would be removed and disposed of during the demolition of the buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that proposed provision of facilities for Project Single
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEAP" rel="nofollow">
         LEAP
        </a>
        —phase one proceed, at the estimated cost of $406 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee’s 17th report of 2006 presents findings in relation to the proposed development of canine kennelling and training facilities for the Australian Federal Police at Majura, ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the proposed works is to provide new and upgraded facilities for handlers and trainers, dog kennelling and training to enable the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        to meet the increasing demand for canine services within Australia and overseas. The project will provide:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         46 main kennels;
        </li>
        <li>
         20 isolation kennels;
        </li>
        <li>
         two quarantine kennels;
        </li>
        <li>
         workshops;
        </li>
        <li>
         magazines and vaults for the storage of explosives, firearms and drugs;
        </li>
        <li>
         an extended and refurbished kennel management facility;
        </li>
        <li>
         a new building to accommodate handlers, trainers and the ACT Community Policing Dog Team; and
        </li>
        <li>
         associated site works and infrastructure.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in November 2006 and progressively completed and operational by November 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee conducted a site inspection of the Majura site noting the inadequacy of the facilities for both handlers and canines. The committee was provided with a comprehensive briefing and demonstration of a canine exercise, further highlighting the importance of this capability within the AFP. We are pleased to recommend that the proposed works proceed, at the estimated cost of $10.2 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee’s 18th report of 2006 addresses the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations at Brindabella Park, ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department currently occupies 13 buildings across the ACT, located in Civic, Turner and Brindabella Business Park. The two main objectives of the proposed works are to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         meet the additional accommodation requirements of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEWR" rel="nofollow">
          DEWR
         </a>
         , which have been significantly affected by the implementation of the workplace relations reforms and expiration of existing sub-lease arrangements; and
        </li>
        <li>
         maximise space efficiencies made possible by larger floor plates on offer at 29-31 Brindabella Business Park, taking advantage of the opportunity to co-locate currently fragmented working groups.
        </li>
        <li>
         The committee considered in detail:
        </li>
        <li>
         the leasing arrangements of current tenancies and options considered for the project;
        </li>
        <li>
         consultation with staff and other relevant stakeholders;
        </li>
        <li>
         specific design initiatives such as individual workstation configuration and the sound attenuation of the building; and
        </li>
        <li>
         general staff amenity.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The committee was pleased to note that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations had consulted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greenhouse Office
        </a>
        and that the department is currently in negotiations with the building owner to attach a green lease schedule allowing for building owner and tenant to achieve 4.5 star ABGR. The committee is hopeful that a green lease schedule can be attached to the project and recommends that the department keep it informed of its progress with this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the committee recommends that the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations proceed, at the estimated cost of $15.1 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank my committee colleagues and all those who assisted with the public hearings, the secretariat and Hansard.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the reports to the House.
