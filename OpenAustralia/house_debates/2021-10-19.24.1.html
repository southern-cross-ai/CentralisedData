        This week I'm participating in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament Week where we have a chance to hear directly from our young people in our electorates. This speech was written by Elvie in my electorate of Melbourne. 'It's time to step up and show you care. You have a duty of care to your children and the earth that we inherit. We've been here yelling as loud and as clear as we can, taking you to court for something so simple. We beg you, let us have this, a future. When I think about what Australia will be like in 20 years on this current trajectory of emissions I see the truth: the mega fires, the extreme weather events and the sea level rising. I see them not being able to breathe from toxic air. I see babies in N95 masks, 10 million children hospitalised from climate caused injuries. How I wish this was just me exaggerating.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, the largest exporter of coal—mining our mother, the land, with your greedy hands, continuing to rip it from beneath the feet of all of us, Aboriginal land, continuing the horrifying torment of genocide and ecocide. How dare you sacrifice us for short-term gain—money. How dare you turn a blind eye when we cannot? And you wonder why we suffer from mental health issues—always on the rise. This is because this is the real world we're living in: the overinformed world. This is the blood on your hands, world. The truth: you have a duty of care to protect us. In 20 years all I want is Australia to be safe.' Thank you, Elvie, from my electorate of Melbourne.

         I also rise today to deliver a speech written by Kahu Milan, an insightful 17-year-old from my own electorate of Wentworth, as part of the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign. Kahu was asked: what do you want Australia to look like in 20 years? This was his response. 'I'm reminded every day of the challenges that face younger Australians, from mental health to community safety, to the social challenges amplified by the pandemic. Tomorrow's Australians have a lot to overcome today. This is why I want the Australia of the future to recognise the importance and contributions of young people and the challenges that they face; a safer Australia that has reduced the threats of alcohol, sexual and community violence and has made mental health services readily available and easily accessible to all; a country that recognises and respects its illustrious Indigenous heritage and honours Australia's long and fascinating cultural heritage; a country that stands up for those who cannot and continues to support those who do so in the global quest for democracy; an Australia that welcomes technological enhancements and harnesses that power for the benefit of all Australians. I want a country where Australians can look to their children and see in them their greatest contribution to Australia's future. I want a future for all Australians, young and old, to look forward to. I believe that we have the strength and the will to continue to advance Australia fair.' Thank you, Kahu, for your contribution to our democratic process.

          I rise today to raise the voice of Jazmyn Michie, who is from my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Jazmyn writes:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … our natural Environment is simultaneously my greatest passion, and greatest fear.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There is nowhere I am happier than experiencing the natural beauty of this world. No time am I sadder than when I think of what we have already lost and what future generations stand to lose.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I am scared. Scared of witnessing another decade of denial. Of not even taking a step, when we need to be sprinting.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          A leader is supposed to use their influence to inspire and empower others. When our own leader said we need less activism in schools, less activism from young people, we were let down. We are done with being silenced, patronised, rejected and scared for our future.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In 20 years we will see resilience, because everything this generation has gone through, will make us strong. The generation who withstood bushfires, a pandemic, climate deniers, record rates of mental illness and yet continued to speak up for what they believe in.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you, Jazmyn, for sending through your words. Thank you to the Raise Our Voice campaign, because raising young people's voices in parliament is a really important part of the democratic process.
