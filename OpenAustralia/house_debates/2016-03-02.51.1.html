       <p>
        Twenty years ago today I was extended to the great privilege of representing the wonderful people of Hunter and I thank them for that honour.

        is a better, wealthier place and has better infrastructure than it did 20 years ago. Its economy is stronger and more diverse. Unemployment, while rising again unfortunately, is much lower than it was.
       </p>
       <p>
        But to my frustration, some things have not changed. Chief amongst them is youth and intergenerational unemployment. Amongst the unemployed at those who are effectively born never to work. We cannot fully achieve social cohesion, keep crime rates low or maximise the strength of our economy while ever people are born to be idle. The intervention has to begin in the earliest years and, amongst other things, that means properly resourcing our schools through the Gonski reforms. We have another big challenge ahead; the money we secure for our coal has fallen dramatically, and thousands are losing their jobs. Many are, or will be, 50 years of age or older and, having spent most of their lives in the coalmining industry, hold skills that are not easily transferrable to other vocations.
       </p>
       <p>
        So we need a plan. First, to establish the case for government intervention; second, to produce a strategy for even greater economic diversity and jobs pathways for those affected by the mining downturn; and third, to develop a robust funding submission for government funding support. Along with my commitment to stronger and better health and education systems, these are my key priorities in this election year. I want to close by thanking my wife, my family and all those who have supported me and, of course, to express my appreciation for the many friendships I have made here.
