        It was a terrific night featuring presentations on the activities of members engaged in many of their varied roles and responsibilities. Brian Wilcox, the branch president, recounted the past season and there were lots of enjoyable and admirable stories. Importantly, a number of awards were presented. All of the lifesavers involved deserve an award, but particular mention was made of junior lifesavers of the year

There were several awards granted for rescue of the month, and hearing the stories you can see what personal risks they put themselves through to save people who are isolated out at sea. The Lower North Coast Branch rescue of the month in January 2014 went to the Black Head Surf Life Saving Club, involving Maddi, Darren, Sandra and

        I commend the work and efforts of our surf lifesavers and the organisation around the country, but on this occasion I want to bring to the attention of the House the work that the Lower North Coast Branch does. I have other branches in my electorate and I enjoy attending their functions as well. Congratulations to them all.
