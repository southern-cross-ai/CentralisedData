         I thank the member for Mallee for her question. She represents a large regional Victorian electorate known for its agricultural produce. It borders two neighbouring states. So the member knows all too well the importance of COVID recovery and making sure we address the challenges. The movement of goods across borders, consistently and unfettered, is critical to supply chains for groceries, medical equipment, export markets and so much more.

             to ensure a national freight code was put in place. The approach was adopted by all. This was well received, certainly after national cabinet approved it, by our truck drivers, who, alongside frontline medical personnel, have been heroes during COVID-19.

             I hear 'Hear, hear!' from the member for Watson. He knows how important truckies are to transport farmers' produce, to keep supermarket shelves stocked and, therefore, to keep people fed. They have been keeping our economy moving. They deliver everything except babies! Truckies are so diligent, so committed—such application!

             We've worked to achieve the same reliability in air services through initiatives such as the Regional Airline Network Support grants and the International Freight Assistance Mechanism. Through the

             program we're supporting regional airlines to maintain those vital services ensuring 164 return flights to more than 100 regional airports, 35 of which would not have received a flight to their airport but for that assistance. Through this mechanism

             , in the member for Mallee's electorate, has access to support in maintaining four weekly return services between Mildura and Melbourne, with additional support available when borders allow—or, should I say, when premiers allow.

             Our assistance in aviation, through the IFAM, has made sure that there have been 6,430 freight flights nationwide, carrying more than 169,000 tonnes of Australian produce. Victorian asparagus producer Momack is a third-generation Australian-Italian business, one of those great migrant stories. It produces 8,000 tonnes of asparagus a year, half of which is destined for export. It's based in

             . The director of sales and operations, Adrian Raffa, said: 'IFAM has enabled Momack to maintain its presence through a more competitive and regular flight schedule to our main international markets. Through the assistance of the program our premium Australian asparagus can maintain its foothold in key markets such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan.'
