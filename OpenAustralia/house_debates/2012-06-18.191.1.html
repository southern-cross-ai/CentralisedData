        </a>
        will be lit up in blue to acknowledge World Autism Awareness Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion is all about ensuring that there is even greater focus on the condition of autism spectrum disorder, that we acknowledge the circumstances of families with autism spectrum disorder within their midst, that we acknowledge the need for a national autism plan, building on those elements that are already in place, and we include as part of that a specific national autism forum. In addition, we note that autism spectrum disorder is one of numerous disability categories, which should be considered as part of a national disability insurance scheme, and that 2 April was World Autism Awareness Day. Let me begin by acknowledging the work of the coalition shadow in this space, Senator Mitch Fifield, and the cooperation that Senator McLucas has given on behalf of the government. I respect and appreciate their commitment. This motion is about a bipartisan approach; it is certainly not about anything which could be seen to undermine that approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        The starting point here is that autism spectrum disorder affects about 30,000 Victorians, on the basis of the advice we have from Murray Dawson-Smith at Autism Victoria. It is a lifelong condition; it is not, however, a lifelong sentence. It is something to be managed and to be negotiated, and the spectrum is just that—it is broad. There are numerous different circumstances that individuals and families face in relation to autism. During a recent visit to Abacus Learning Centre, I was lucky enough to meet three-year-old Charlie and his mother, Nicole. I joined Charlie for his therapy sessions. I saw for myself the painstaking work carried out by early intervention therapists and the benefits that therapy can bring to a family affected by autism. That all lead to the proposal that we had for an autism walk around my electorate. We walked 500 kilometres, visited 56 schools and, most importantly, spoke with thousands of young students about autism—respecting those who have it and helping them aspire to their best. The critical thing that we learned and which was given to them was this sense of possibility and of potential for each young life affected by autism.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the walk, I had me Marilyn Myszka, Natalie Durkovic, Nicole Devine and Sue DeBono, all of whom walked numerous kilometres—in the case of Marilyn, Natalie and Sue, well over 200 kilometres each, and 300 in the case of my good friend Sue DeBono. It was a real pleasure. Marilyn, Natalie and Nicole are all mothers of boys with autism. Each contributed to the walk in a profound way and contributed to local understanding. At the end of the day, we were able to raise over $35,000 to be shared between Autism Victoria and the magnificent Abacus Learning Centre, which has literally transformed the lives of so many young people with autism in my electorate. In particular, we were fortunate to receive $10,000 from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medibank_Private" rel="nofollow">
         Medibank Private
        </a>
        and $5,000 from the Victorian government. I thank both of those organisations and in particular
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wooldridge" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Wooldridge
        </a>
        , the state minister who oversaw that contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we agreed on, though, was that it had to be more than just fine words. It was about next steps. That is where this motion comes in. What we want to do is make sure that there is the push for an advanced national autism plan. I acknowledge the work that governments of all levels, including the current government, have done in this space. I made a commitment to the relevant parliamentary secretary that I would acknowledge the good work of the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is now the moment where we can seek more, where we can be higher and where we can be better in what we do. My view is that to seek out a national autism plan, including a forum, as to how best to deliver long-term, permanent support to families caring for a member that has autism spectrum disorder is the great step forward. I look at the work of the Abacus centre and see what parents such as Michael and Lauren Moore have done and the way in which early intervention is fundamental. What we need now is a long-term approach about early intervention because, of all the investments we can make as a society, investing in these young people is about unparalleled lifelong transformation which makes us the best that we can be as a society.

         <p>
          I second the amendment. There is absolutely no doubt that autism spectrum disorder diagnoses are on the rise, and nowhere greater than the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
           Hunter Valley
          </a>
          . Autism spectrum disorder is a condition that not only affects the individual but the parents, the family and our community as a whole and therefore needs greater support and community understanding.
         </p>
         <p>
          Whilst it was fitting that 2 April 2012 was
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Autism_Awareness_Day" rel="nofollow">
           World Autism Awareness Day
          </a>
          , it was more fitting that in April 2012 the new Aspect Hunter School was handed over for occupation. There is a story about the Aspect Hunter School that is worth telling to this House. In August 2010 I met with a constituent,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Austin" rel="nofollow">
           Tim Austin
          </a>
          . He was desperate and despaired that there was no suitable school for his autistic son, Joe. The Autism Spectrum Australia Aspect Hunter School was without a permanent home. They were being evicted from its base at Shortland Public School and a satellite classroom at Tighes Hill Public School the next year. Because of the stimulus package building works, those schools had pushed them out.
         </p>
         <p>
          During the meeting I called a friend, Hilton Grugeon, and asked if he knew of a block of land that we could acquire to build a school on, and whether he could help build the school. He said yes. I asked, 'How much?' He said, 'How much do you have?' I said, 'Very little.' There was a moment's silence and then he said, 'Okay, let's build a school.' When I advised Tim during this initial meeting that we were going to build a school for the kids and for the parents who have to deal with the lifelong challenges of autism, he thought I was kidding. So I put the phone on loudspeaker. Hilton told him, 'We're going to build a school for the kids.' He broke down and he cried.
         </p>
         <p>
          The die was set. By the next morning, through the generosity of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owens" rel="nofollow">
           Richard Owens
          </a>
          , 14 acres of land was donated for the school. Planning had begun. The school was designed. The school has six classrooms, each with a bathroom. There is a sensory room, a school hall and an administration block for 60 teaching and support staff. The school caters for 40 students onsite and 100 in outreach programs run from the school.
         </p>
         <p>
          The project, land and building value was in excess of $5 million, yet Aspect had only attracted $1.8 million in Commonwealth government funding. There was a serious shortfall. It was decided that we would put the call out to businesses and the broader community for support for our kids. That support came. Through Hilton Grugeon's 'Hunter nearly-everything' group of companies—for example, Hunter Readymixed Concrete, Hunter Buildings, Steeline Hunter, Hunter Quarries, and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Irrigation" rel="nofollow">
           Hunter Irrigation
          </a>
          and Water Solutions—and the very generous in kind support from dozens of other suppliers, we were able to start. As we told the story, financial support in cash came from Hilton and Bev Grugeon, Jeff and Tracy McCloy, Michael and Felicity Thompson—it just came forth.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is hard to say no to this very worthwhile project. They came from all over. The tradies, the plumbers, the carpenters, the electricians, the plasterers, the painters and even East Maitland Men's Shed all lined up to help. Even my son
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baldwin" rel="nofollow">
           David Baldwin
          </a>
          , who had finished his carpentry apprenticeship in October, worked as a full-time volunteer as a carpenter until he started his new job in late February. At 21 years of age he wanted to put something back into a community that had supported him. The earthworks began in late October, and construction began in December. The fact that it was one of our wettest summers did not deter the builders and the hundreds of volunteers. The school was handed over in April. To build a school in just over four months is an achievement in itself. Given that it was one of our wettest summers, this was a truly amazing achievement. It is clear that whenever there is a genuine community need in the Hunter the heroes in the Hunter step up to the fore and that these heroes were not going to let Hunter kids down.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is planning for an early intervention centre for a two-year-olds and up. It will cost another $750,000 to build. As the state government is yet to provide any funding towards the school, I am hopeful that it will provide the finance for this much needed project so that the school can be complete and that thereby our community can also be complete. Sadly, in December last year Tim Austin succumbed to the pressure, leaving behind his wife, Loretto, and children, Emilie and Joe. This school stands as a tribute to the tireless work of Tim Austin.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is abundantly clear that there is a need for a national autism plan, including a forum to discuss how to best deliver support to families caring for a family member with an autism spectrum disorder. That support should be addressed as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I commend the member for Flinders for bringing this motion before the House, and I support it in its entirety.

          </small>
          <p>
           I thank the member for Flinders for moving this motion. I have in my electorate, as there are in every electorate, a number of families who have children with autism. They are one of the most wonderful groups of parents that you can possibly imagine, and both previous speakers have referred to how extraordinary they can be.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the things that I am very proud of in being part of this government for the last four years is the work we have done which helps empower some of those parents even further through early intervention and the development of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Sometimes we think we are pretty clever in this parliament because we allocate money and set up programs, but we all know that at the end of the day it is the work the parent does in the home and how well you can enable that parent to work with their child which makes the most difference at the end of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back in 2007 in the election we announced that we would launch the Helping Children with Autism program. It was originally meant to be about $190 million; it is now sitting at about $220 million. It unashamedly focuses its efforts on early intervention. We all know that intervention in the early years makes an extraordinary difference to the life of a child with autism and to their family. There are a number of elements to the Helping Children with Autism program which we have been rolling out for quite a few years. There is the Autism Advisory and Support Service, which has some 36 centres with advisers around the country. It is a one-stop shop where a parent can go for advice on how to get assistance. We also have early intervention funding. This is quite a change from the way funding was delivered in past years. It is $12,000 per family with a child under the age of seven. It allows the child's family considerable flexibility in deciding which services—such as pathology, psychology and occupational therapy—they want for their child with autism spectrum disorder. Again, this is quite a change from past years, when the funding was attached to the service itself. It is part of the change we are undertaking which moves us to the National Disability Insurance Scheme where families will have a far greater role across the board and where the relationship between a family and the providers of the services will change in quite a significant way.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have launched
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Days" rel="nofollow">
            Early Days
           </a>
           workshops for parents and carers of preschool and school age children with autism spectrum disorder. We have also launched PlayConnect groups. There are about 150 playgroups around the country specifically for families and children with autism spectrum disorder. Again, both those forums—the Early Days workshops and the PlayConnect groups—provide opportunities for parents, families and carers to come together to share what they know and to feel the support of being with people who face similar kinds of challenges and joys in the raising of their children, something that again makes parents stronger as individuals and stronger as groups. One of the things that we all should acknowledge is that the more we empower parents, the more we help them actually work in the way they need to with their children, the stronger they become, not just as parents but as lobbyists as well. The stronger we make them the more they will rightfully ask of us, and that is one of the things that we will probably do that will have an incredibly profound impact in the long run. They are already one of the most extraordinary groups of parents, and they already know each other, but as they get to know exactly what is happening elsewhere, and build those networks further, they will become even stronger in their quite rightful demands for the future of their children. They are a wonderful group of people.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have also established six autism-specific early learning and care centres around the country. There is one in south-western Sydney—not one in Parramatta, unfortunately. If there is going to be a seventh one I would like to put my hand up, as I am sure we all would. These centres provide places where children with autism spectrum disorder get the specific help that they need. Their families can see their progress on a daily basis and we have had wonderful reports of how well those things are going. Again I commend the member for Flinders for moving this motion. It is an incredibly important area. The more support we can provide early on in a child's life, the greater the possibilities of that life. I commend the motion.

            I rise in support of the concept and the issue behind the motion on autism spectrum disorder, although I have some disagreement with aspects of the detail that the member for Flinders is seeking to achieve as a result of this motion and I will come to those points. The general point about the need to ensure that there is greater awareness and support for action within the community for those who suffer from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASD" rel="nofollow">
             ASD
            </a>
            and those who support them and who deal with those issues is something that I think the parliament can agree on, no question. I know a lot of work has been done, as the member for Flinders said, by governments of both persuasions over the years to try and ensure that this area gets more support.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that the current government, of which I am very proud to be a member, has had a range of initiatives over the last few years, since 2008, under the Helping Children with Autism package. The government has provided over $220 million for services for children with ASD. That has covered a range of different issues: early intervention funding available to eligible children to increase and support access to early intervention therapies;
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Days" rel="nofollow">
             Early Days
            </a>
            workshops; information for parents and carers of pre-school and school aged children with ASD; an autism advisory service providing advice, information and support following diagnosis across Australia; PlayConnect playgroups—some 150 playgroups specifically for families and children with ASD or ASD-like symptoms; a website; and other positive initiatives via recognition under Medicare. More recently, as I understand it, the government has also established six autism-specific early learning and care centres which provide specific early learning programs and support to children with ASD or ASD-like symptoms in a long day care centre. But we can always look to the future and ensure that more is done.
           </p>
           <p>
            One general point I would make is about something this government has been very strong on—and I certainly congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the Hon.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_McLucas" rel="nofollow">
             Jan McLucas
            </a>
            , for the work she has done on this—and that is the development of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, to which $1 billion was allocated in the last budget. It is a step along a track, it is a track which will take some time and there are clearly a range of issues which need to be worked through. But there is no doubt that there is broad recognition within the community that a more holistic approach is needed in dealing with the needs of those with a disability, and a recognition that it is a responsibility of all levels of governments and that its time has come. It is something that we can all support.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will pick up on a couple of points that the member for Flinders had in his motion which I think need to be debated to a degree. Regarding the issue of diagnosis of ASD being on the rise, my understanding from the current evidence base, which the government has from its Helping Children with Autism package, would appear to suggest a prevalence rate in the order of one to 110 for children under seven. This rate has levelled off over the past three years, as it has done internationally. That does not in any way take away from the importance of the issue, but it does possibly suggest that we are getting a fairly sound understanding of the size of the problem and therefore the need for action.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the question of a national ASD plan and the holding of a forum, again we could debate the question of what we currently have and what the alternatives may be. The point I would make with respect to this is that we need to look at disabilities on an individual basis. The needs of people with disabilities should be focused on their functionality, not on the label. I think we need to look also at the question of what is coming, what is occurring from a national perspective through the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
             NDIS
            </a>
            , as a way forward to ensure that there is scope for all children and all people with disabilities to get the assistance that they need as part of a much bigger set of actions by government across the board.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also note that there are a number of peak bodies that represent people with ASD. They include the Australian Advisory Board on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Disorder" rel="nofollow">
             Autism Spectrum Disorder
            </a>
            s, which provides advice to government; Autism Awareness, which promotes nationally inclusion for people with ASD; and Children with Disability Australia, which represents children with ASD. The question mark I have is whether another forum will in itself produce results which are worthy of that effort. But certainly this is a motion where the concerns around autism should be made known nationally and action should be supported by all sides of the parliament.

             I take the opportunity today to support the motion of the member for Flinders,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
              Greg Hunt
             </a>
             , with respect to autism spectrum disorders. Depending on which research you listen to and who you talk to, autism spectrum disorders are on the rise with, as the member for Bruce just said, one in 110—some say it is one in 160—Australian children diagnosed with a disorder. These figures are increasing and the disorder is becoming more and more prevalent, particularly in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" rel="nofollow">
              First World
             </a>
             nations such as Australia. However, research has shown that with proven early intervention measures the effects of the disorder can be significantly reduced and children are even able to rejoin mainstream schooling to continue their education. As we know, the aim of all parents involved is that their child gets to a point where they can live independently at some stage in their future.
            </p>
            <p>
             Associations such as the Autism Association of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australia
             </a>
             , led by Joan McKenna Kerr, have structured their early intervention programs based on research into the most effective models of best practice. These include individual support services, highly structured and supportive environments, autism-specific content and a functional approach to behaviour management and family involvement. At this stage I would like to mention also the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEARN" rel="nofollow">
              LEARN
             </a>
             Foundation, which is run by Mandy Mason and her great number of supporters, which offers a choice in treatments. As I said, no one should in any way discriminate against or criticise any of the programs, other than to say that a choice and an alternative approach are always welcomed in trying to achieve the best outcome. But, as I said, this disorder is on the rise and it is essential that ongoing financial support is given to these organisations in order for them to cope with an increase in demand and the need to apply early intervention measures as early as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through the 'adopt a politician' program, five years ago I met young Dermott Barnard his family. Dermott lives with severe autism. I have witness firsthand the huge impact that this has had on his family, his mum Lynn and his Elise. Dermott's mum and sister have always had his best interests at heart, but they have found it difficult to access all of the respite and support services they need to manage Dermott's disorder. Families of children living with autism often go unrecognised and miss out on the support and the respite that they often desperately need. I have heard stories from various people within my electorate who have resorted to desperate and unhelpful measures to give themselves some immediate respite. For example, a mother told me at the door that she had sat her child in front of the front load washing machine just to have him entertained for an hour or so because she could not cope any longer. In my recent Canning Walk for Autism, I was able to raise over $22,500 for the Autism Association of Western Australia and respite services such as INKA Respite in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Clifton" rel="nofollow">
              Lake Clifton
             </a>
             . Without these small not-for-profit respite services, many families would be feeling even more desperate and might resort to even worse actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also important to note that, whilst respite is needed for families and children living with autism, it is also essential that a large proportion of this respite be flexible. Flexibility is the key to this respite. This enables families to access respite when they need it and when they are most desperate, rather than having to book months ahead, when they do not necessarily need it. Having a national autism plan, including a forum, would provide the opportunity to discuss the issues further. The families of children such as Dermott would have a clearer idea of where to get further help, and it would provide a framework of the best intervention measures available.
            </p>
            <p>
             With the rate of autism spectrum disorders increasing, this action is needed now more than ever. There is no doubt that these disorders should be included as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As we are being positive today, I will say that the scheme is supported by this side of the House, although we do have some issues about the level of funding. I will not say anything further about that. But, if the scheme were implemented in full, it would provide a positive opportunity for families to get some relief.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would also like to support national recognition of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Autism_Day" rel="nofollow">
              World Autism Day

             in blue. This would significantly help raise broader awareness of the disorder, as well as reaffirm the commitment of this House to providing ongoing support and services. This year, World Autism Day fell during my Walk for Autism, and I was lucky enough to be welcomed by the students of Dale Christian School for a fundraising barbecue. I was also joined by Joan McKenna Kerr and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Beard" rel="nofollow">

             . He came and walked with me on that day. This significant day helped bring wider awareness, and I support this motion.

              are a group of development disorders that are apparent usually before the age of three and are overwhelmingly predominant amongst males. Whatever the country, it seems that the proportion of females with the disorder is always under about 20 per cent. The disorders are a unique combination of abnormalities in reciprocal social interaction, patterns of communication and restricted and stereotyped interests and activities.

              On 26 May, I was fortunate enough to attend, with my colleague the member for Hughes, the annual gala event of the Autism Advisory and Support Service. The member for Hughes is a member of that organisation. During that evening, while discussing things with his wife, I learnt more fully—I already had some appreciation of them—of the kinds of challenges that families face in this sector.

               Autism Spectrum Disorder
              </a>
              s. That is a very worthwhile gesture. The centre would have the support of 11 organisations, seven universities and one medical research institute, as well as 30 other organisations. This is in conjunction with the $1 billion over four years for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was some speculation earlier about the reasons for increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders. Who knows whether it is because of more knowledge in the sector, a willingness of people to come forward, improved testing or some phenomena related to our environment and our lifestyle? There is a prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in south-west Sydney. People have put that down to a possible genetic connection with ethnicity, and particularly to the prevalence of public housing. One of the realities is that autism and many other of these kinds of issues lead to the separation of parents and the need for one party to go into public housing. Recently the Sydney French Film Festival featured the film

              . It was not about autism but it certainly drove home this issue. It was an account of the director's life as a young mother and the break-up of her relationship in connection with a child who had issues.

              The Autism Advisory and Support Service is based in Liverpool. It has had a strong connection with me, the member for Hughes and the member for Fowler. The parliamentary secretary was there and she is certainly aware of the organisation's services and issues. At the moment, they are seeking a meeting with the parliamentary secretary to drive home their concerns. I particularly appreciate that a group of families in south-west Sydney can accomplish what they have, using volunteers to get off the ground, establish premises and run a 24-hour telephone service which is utilised nationally. They are heavily involved in a variety of other activities. There is a young adults—over 16 years old—peer group that meets every second Sunday and a family support group that meets twice a month. They have obtained significant support from a number of organisations, such as the Mounties club—otherwise known as

              The event that we attended in May was again this year a very successful fundraiser. It enjoys very significant broad public support. The facility at Liverpool is first rate, with playground and teaching facilities to give parents some respite. The organisation also works very well with the

              </a>
              , who provide concerts for children. The founder of the Autism Advisory and Support Service, Grace Fava, has said on the question of music in the lives of these children:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Children with autism and additional needs have a great affinity for music in general and classical music in particular. It relaxes them and gives them a safe outlet for their emotions.
             </p>
             <p>
              I want to reiterate that all members, regardless of their political allegiance, are very supportive of Grace's efforts. We hope that the federal government can make sure that her knowledge, her activity, her enthusiasm and that of the other volunteers are recognised and that they get some say in the process around funding in this country and with regard to upcoming developments.
