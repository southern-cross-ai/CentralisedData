        My question is to the Minister for Health. Will the minister please update the House on how the Morrison government is supporting the mental health and wellbeing of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 recession?

         I want to thank the member for

         , who's been a passionate advocate for mental health, along with so many members of this House—indeed, all members of this House. One of the reasons, of course, is that his electorate, like every electorate, has so many Australians who suffer with the challenges of mental health. In any one year, four million Australians will be struggling with some form of mental health challenge. Over the course of the life of this government, we've therefore invested, taking the resources available from about $3.4 billion to $5.7 billion, a more than two-thirds increase.
        </p>
        <p>
         But this year has been a tough year—a global pandemic, with more than 25½ million people diagnosed now and, by the time this parliament reconvenes for the budget, most probably over 30 million, with most probably more than a million lives officially lost, and many more lost. Australia has not been immune to that. We know that the impact of this condition has had a profound health effect. Seven out of eight states and territories have, fortunately, put themselves in a position where it has largely been defeated, but we are on watch.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Victoria, the challenge that we face, of course, is that the lockdowns have a profound impact on mental health, on the ability of people to exercise, on anxiety, on depression. All of these elements are at risk. That's why, through the course of this pandemic, we've invested very strongly, firstly, and perhaps most importantly, on a national basis, with the creation of a 10-year plan for telehealth, delivered in 10 days. We have whole-of-population telehealth, now with well over 28 million services, and mental health being a large part of that. As I mentioned, 59 per cent of services for mental health in the last month in Victoria were delivered through telehealth.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition do that, $74 million has been invested specifically in support services: $10 million for

         ; $14 million for Lifeline and Kids Helpline; support for Orygen and, in particular, headspace, and Head to Health online; and support for older Australians, with the funding that's been provided to assist them with their mental health through in-reach. Within Victoria, we've doubled the number of

         </a>
         psychological services. That's been a critical step forward, as well as making sure that we are investing in 15 new psychological and mental health centres that will be available not just now but over the course of the coming year, and potentially beyond, I hope and expect. That's an important investment in saving lives and protecting lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's a pandemic which has affected the world, but it's a pandemic where we have come into it with a plan to protect the lives and the mental health of Australians, and we will continue to fight to do that.
