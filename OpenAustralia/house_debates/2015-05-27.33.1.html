       <p>
        I would like to tell the chamber about a remarkable young woman in my electorate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Emily Smith
        </a>
        will shortly be honoured with the Queens Young Leader's Award. Only 60 people internationally will be receiving this award, and Emily is one of just two Australians. She is a most deserving winner. She is being recognised for her efforts within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Australia as well as her extensive community work on youth and gender equality. At only 23 she has already represented Australia and the Girl Guides at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        59th session of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">
         Commission on the Status of Women
        </a>
        . She also attended the commission in 2013, representing the voices of over 10 million girls and young women from across the globe. She was a keynote speaker and panellist there, as well as a highly effective lobbyist. Last December Emily was named New South Wales Youth Volunteer of the Year.

        Emily departs for Britain to receive her award in the coming weeks. She is, literally, going to London to visit the Queen. She will also be engaged with several business meetings and high-profile events, including meetings with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         British Prime Minister

        and the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, interviews and press at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" rel="nofollow">

        headquarters, and several press opportunities to speak about her charitable work. Emily's amazing story is an inspiration to us all. She has already achieved a huge amount and can look forward to a very exciting and engaging time ahead. I am sure the whole House would like to join me in congratulating Emily and wishing her well on her next adventure.
