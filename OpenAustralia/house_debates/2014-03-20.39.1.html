        On 9 March the champion racehorse Dulcify was the latest equine champion to enter the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Racing_Hall_of_Fame" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Racing Hall of Fame
        </a>
        here at the ceremony in Canberra. It was only by chance that his part-owner, my friend Alan Maller, came to be involved with this great horse. Unknowingly, Alan was sitting next to legendary trainer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
         Colin Hayes
        </a>
        , and made the industry faux pas of asking, 'Who are you?' This simple question would lead Alan to a strong friendship with Colin Hayes and the resultant offer of part share in this horse—Dulcify.

        Foaled in 1975 in

        , Dulcify was the offspring of Decies—a British-bred sire who was a champion in his own right—and Sweet Candy, another Hall of Fame inductee. Dulcify was relatively cheap due to his parrot mouth. He won the

        </a>
        , and the Underwood and Mackinnon Stakes. Dulcify won 10 of his 21 starts, with the first win being at the outstanding odds of 330 to one. He won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Plate" rel="nofollow">
         Cox Plate
        </a>
        by seven lengths and was ridden by jockey Brent Thomson. This was to be his crowning achievement. Dulcify ran at Flemington seven times and won six group races. Unfortunately, during his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Cup
        </a>
        race, for which he was favourite, he was injured by the eventual winner, Hyperno, who galloped on Dulcify, and he had to be put down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dulcify had an outstanding career and it was very upsetting for the owners when he was put down. It is a fitting gesture for a truly loved and great champion to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. According to Colin Hayes, Dulcify was the best horse he had ever trained. I congratulate Alan Maller, Billy Rigg and the Hayes family on an outstanding champion.
