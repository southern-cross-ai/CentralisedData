        Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works:

         National Broadband Network

        first release sites announced by Senator Conroy and NBN Co.

        on 2 March 2010. The five first release sites are to achieve high-speed fibre-to-the-premises broadband on mainland Australia as part of live trials of NBN Co.â€™s network design and construction methods. The test sites are a part of the suburb of Brunswick in Melbourne; an area of Townsville covering parts of the suburbs of Aitkenvale and Mundingburra; the coastal communities of Minnamurra and

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW

        , including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_England" rel="nofollow">
         University of New England
        </a>
        ; and the rural town of Willunga in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . Each site contains approximately 3,000 premises, except the rural towns, where there are fewer dwellings. The sites were selected by NBN Co. network planners and engineers because they represent the diverse situations NBN Co. will encounter during the network rollout.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sites will provide NBN Co. with an opportunity to test and document different design and construction techniques in a range of situations and variety in terms of geography, housing type and density, local infrastructure and other local factors. NBN Co. will be proactively consulting with the local communities about plans during the design phase. It may be necessary to dig trenches in some circumstances. However, NBN Co. will be considering other methods to minimise disruption during the rollout such as using the existing ducts or overhead power poles where possible. The estimated cost of the first release sites is above the threshold for referral to the Public works Committee. The first release sites are on the critical path for the main rollout. Getting the first release sites underway is urgent as risks of delay are high.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the importance of the role of the Public Works Committee is acknowledged, in this instance the selection of the first release sites was not able to be finalised until the completion of critical work, including the acquisition of appropriate geospatial mapping tools necessary to generate appropriate network designs. This work was not completed in time to allow for referral to the committee. However, I note that the program has been and remains within the scope of the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network and is therefore subject to scrutiny in that forum. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are scheduled to commence in April 2010 and be completed in early 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that a proposal to proceed with the construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common. The government very much supports the work of the Public Works Committee and has not taken this decision lightly. I commend the motion to the House.
