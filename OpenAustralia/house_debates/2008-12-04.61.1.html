        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister inform the House about the importance of road safety, especially over the holiday period, and what the government is doing to save lives on our roads?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I note that recently he gave a speech in the House about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         ’s rising road toll, calling particularly upon young people in the Northern Territory to take care. I know that this is an issue that affects every member of this House. As we prepare for the holiday period, tens of thousands of Australians will be travelling around the country to spend time with their family and loved ones or to take up the Minister for Tourism’s call to travel during the festive season. But it is an unfortunate reality that a number of those who embark on that journey will not reach their destination. Over the last 12 months, 1,509 Australians died on the nation’s roads. Whilst this was six per cent less than the previous year, it still equates to over four people every day. This is indeed a national tragedy and the statistics alone of course do not even begin to tell the full story of pain and loss experienced by their families. A loss of life at Christmas is particularly devastating.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all have a role to play in reducing the road toll. We should all remember the so-called ‘fatal four’ that are factors in the overwhelming majority of crashes: drink-driving, speeding, fatigue and not wearing a seatbelt. These can literally be fatal mistakes.

         that was attended by both sides of the House. They came with one clear message: road safety is paramount. The three organisations reminded us that the National
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Safety" rel="nofollow">
          Road Safety
         </a>
         Strategy’s target of a 40 per cent reduction in fatalities by 2010 is unlikely to be met. That is why we, as a parliament, have to redouble our efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year Australia’s transport ministers initiated a National Road Safety Council to bring together community leaders and experts to coordinate road safety reforms. We have held an Indigenous road safety summit and the first ever motorcycle and scooter safety conference. We have kicked off the keys2drive program with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
          AAA
         </a>
         which focuses on road safety for young drivers. We are consulting on a proposal to make electronic stability control mandatory in all new Australian vehicles.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC" rel="nofollow">
          ESC
         </a>
         helps drivers keep control of their vehicles and research shows that vehicles equipped with the ESC are 25 per cent less likely to be involved in a fatal accident.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are just some of the things that the government is doing. I urge all members to take care on the roads and to take the opportunity in the lead-up to the Christmas break to remind constituents in their electorates about the road safety message. My office and my department are willing to assist members of parliament to get that message out in each and every one of our electorates, and I encourage you to do that in the coming weeks.
