        The Australian Bravery Declarations are awarded annually to those who display courage and bravery to protect others. This year, 22 commendations for brave conduct were awarded, including to Gregory John Anderson from Robina and to Palm Beach's Lucas Glenn Short.

        was commended for his attempted rescue of a man from a rip at Currumbin in 2020. After escaping a rip while swimming, he and another swimmer assisted an elderly man to safety. When they noticed another swimmer was missing, Mr Anderson went back in. The man was brought to shore and

        was performed. Unfortunately, the swimmer passed away.

        Mr Short was commended for his actions in rescuing two swimmers in

        in 2022. Mr Short was with a friend when they saw a young girl and her father caught in a rip. He paddled out to reach them and guided them to safety. His friend had also gone out to assist, but got caught in the rip. Mr Short went back in and paddled his friend back to the beach, where he was treated by ambulance officers.

        I commend these brave men for their courage and selflessness in rescuing others in very dangerous conditions. Our community is proud of you both and inspired by your very brave actions.
