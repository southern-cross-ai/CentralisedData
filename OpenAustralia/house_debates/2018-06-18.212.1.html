        Morry Breen is a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        builder, environmentalist, inventor, unionist, footballer and coach who last week was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his services to our Central Coast community. Unfortunately, Morry was admitted to hospital on Sunday morning and missed his celebration at Wyong Rugby League Club, where Greg Tun,

        </a>
        , Neil Rose, Rod Wicks and others spoke of his extraordinary contribution. Morry's son Jim spoke on his behalf. Jim said that when Morry found out he had been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , he said, ‘I'm not a royalist, but I got this Queen thing and I'll accept the bastard for the club and all the people.' Jim said of his Dad that Morry always had the courage of his convictions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Mundey" rel="nofollow">

        agreed. Jack and Judy visited Morry in Wyong hospital today, and Jack has spoken often of Morry and their time together in the green ban movement. The most significant of these bans for the coast was the green ban the Central Coast Trades and Labour Council, under Morry's inspiring leadership, successfully imposed on the Hooker-Rex proposed residential development of Riley's Island in the 1970s. Prior to that, Morry had played a major role in preserving the red gum forest of the north Entrance Peninsula, standing up to the threats of international mining companies to preserve the bush and putting his family home on the line to do it—typical of Morry. For these efforts and many more in sport, affordable housing and the environment, we owe Morry a great debt of gratitude. Morry, we're all grateful that you arrived on the coast in 1963 to take up coaching the Wyong Roos—up the green and golds! Congratulations, Morry Breen OAM, and thank you.
