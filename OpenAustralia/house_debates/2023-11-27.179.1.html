        I want to acknowledge the month of November as the month of the legendary moustacheâ€”more widely known as Movember. The month also includes the celebration of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Men's Day
        </a>
        . Movember raises awareness of prostate cancer and now also focuses on mental health, mental wellbeing and suicide prevention amongst men.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a society, we know that changing the face of men's health changes society. Encouraging men to stay healthy in all aspects of their life changes society. Staying socially connected and becoming more open to discussing mental health challenges also changes society. An understanding and promotion of these experiences are the foundation of positive male role models, without which our society at large would be grossly disadvantaged.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day working men, retired men and men seeking the dignity of work tackle issues in our society where job security, economic security and male expression are elements that are becoming more and more precarious. If we're to work on promoting men's health, improving gender relations, gender equality and highlighting positive male role models, we must address these issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Parliament House recently we were joined by the Australian Men's Shed Association, with the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Shed, to launch Men's Shed Week to celebrate three decades of connection, community and camaraderie. I want to acknowledge our local Men's Shed in Craigieburn for the amazing work they do for men of all ages and social backgrounds in our local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The beauty of our local Men's Shed, not unlike many in communities across Australia, is the diversity of its members from all backgrounds with ranging life experiences and skills, including social and cultural diversity. The group's activities have led to increased participation of men with mental health challenges and disabilities, including mobile challenges and mobility changes; men who are employed and unemployed; and men who are experiencing social disadvantage, all of whom carry a commitment to one another and to the broader community they live in.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the very hard work of Bruce Tripptree, the president of Hume Men's Shed in Craigieburn. The amazing work he and his team do to generate income for various projects and activities to cover the running costs enables the shed to significantly improve our local men's health. The extraordinary efforts of Bruce and his team in running various programs have led to an increase in membership, all due to their tireless dedication to creating an inclusive environment centred around empowerment and solidarity.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many, Men's Shed is a home, and our community sees it as an extension of our own because of that organisation's vibrant and inclusive nature. In celebrating the contribution of men in our local community, I salute their efforts and congratulate all the men in my community who do a wonderful job each and every day.
