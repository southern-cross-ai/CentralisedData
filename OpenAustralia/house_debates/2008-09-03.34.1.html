        My question is to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of developments overnight in Afghanistan involving Australian troops?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Last night, soldiers of the Australian Special Operations Task Group in southern Afghanistan became engaged in a battle with Taliban extremists. I regret to inform the House that nine Australian troops have been wounded in this action. One soldier has suffered life-threatening wounds, five soldiers have suffered serious wounds and three soldiers have suffered light wounds. The wounded soldiers were provided with immediate first aid by their comrades at the scene before being evacuated by helicopter to coalition medical facilities. Several Taliban extremists were killed in the action. I am advised that this action is ongoing and that members of the Special Operations Task Group remain in the field undertaking their essential but dangerous work.
        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of all Australians, let me say that our thoughts and our prayers are with the wounded soldiers, their comrades in the field of battle and their families and loved ones. This action, and the toll it has taken on these members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         , underscores the importance and the dangers of the vital mission they are undertaking in Afghanistan on behalf of us all. Let us make no mistake: they are engaged in a vital mission.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taliban" rel="nofollow">
          The Taliban
         </a>
         can never again be allowed to use Afghanistan as a training ground, a hiding place or a launching pad for terrorist operations around the world—terrorists that advocate harm to Australians as well; terrorists that trained there to take the lives of our countrymen in Bali in 2002; and terrorists that, if permitted a safe haven, would seek to attack us and others again.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, like those who put themselves in harm’s way last night, that are taking the fight to this enemy of us all. They are disrupting, destroying and displacing those that would seek to return Afghanistan and its people to the bastion of terror that we had during the period of the Taliban administration. At the same time, it is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are building, teaching and mentoring the people of this province so that they may take charge of the land, take charge of their lives and, in time, take charge of their own security. It is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force that risk their lives every day in pursuit of this aspiration on behalf of us all. The fight in Afghanistan goes on. It involves our special forces aggressively taking the fight to the Taliban. It involves our reconstruction and mentoring troops rebuilding the infrastructure and capabilities of the civil community and the security services. And it involves us working closely with our friends and partners in Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are not the only ones to see our troops face danger. On 19 August, 10 soldiers from France lost their lives and 21 were wounded on one dreadful day in Kabul province, east of the capital. France, under the leadership of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Sarkozy" rel="nofollow">
          President Sarkozy
         </a>
         , has been a strong supporter of the fight in Afghanistan, and France has paid a high price. I want to recognise the commitment of the French government to supporting the vital mission in Afghanistan and the commitment of our other allies in the field. The Australian government remains committed to assisting the people of Afghanistan and their democratically elected government to achieve a measure of the stability and prosperity that we take for granted in our country here. And today while we may pause to reflect on the bravery and sacrifice of our fighting men and women our adversaries should take heed of the resolve of Australia’s soldiers, the resolve of the Australian government and the resolve of the Australian people in bringing to an end this unsustainable instability and conflict in Afghanistan.

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to strongly associate the opposition with the remarks made by the Prime Minister in relation to the nine Australian soldiers who have been wounded in Afghanistan. This brings to 53 the number of Australians who have been wounded in our name, in our uniform and under our flag in this struggle against resurgent totalitarianism and Islamic extremism in Afghanistan. Our thoughts and our prayers are with not only them but also their families, those who love them and the other members of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          . I join with the Prime Minister in ensuring that the political will and resolve of this parliament will remain as firm as it has ever been to see this through and see that we are able to liberate the people of Afghanistan and, in doing so, ensure the freedoms that we have come to enjoy in our generation for those who come after us.
