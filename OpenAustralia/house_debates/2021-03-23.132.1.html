        After having been cancelled last year, it's great to see many of our country shows bouncing back this year. The Maclean Show is one of the first on the calendar in my region. I'd like to acknowledge those competing in the showgirl sections. The junior showgirls include Neeve Fischer, Ella Jeffery, Emily Connelly, April Shannon, Skye Harrison and Madeline Hollis, and the senior showgirls competing this year are Grace Boulton, Hayley Johnson, Maneesha Davis, Alyssa Luland and Amber Gravolin.

        I'd also like to acknowledge the show executive, who make this event happen—Brian Ferrie, Leigh-Ann Messer, Nicole Cowling, Jackie Sykes and Pru Ensby. Other members include Endessa Schradar,

        I can't talk about this year's Maclean Show without mentioning the late Bruce Green, who sadly passed away earlier in the year. He was deeply involved in many of the

        winner. Paris Brailsford is in year 12 at Maclean High School and has a great history of volunteering, youth advocacy and leadership positions. Her winning story in this year's
        <i>
         Heywire
        </i>
        is a very moving recount of the recent bushfires. Paris was mentally prepared for the worst, that the villages of Angourie and Wooloweyah would be no more because of the fire. All that stood between the fire and the villages was a band of courageous firies who had left their homes to fight for others. As she woke up the next day over breakfast and heard the news that not one single home was lost, she knew that we owed it all to our firefighters. The last sentence of her story was:

        It was a great contribution to

        . Paris is also a volunteer surf lifesaver and has been awarded numerous awards, including the Junior Surf Lifesaver of the Year in 2018. She's an avid member of the
