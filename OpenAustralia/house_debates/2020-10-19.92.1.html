        My question is the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government's plan for jobs includes a gas led recovery that will deliver the reliable and affordable energy that we need to come out the other side of the COVID recession? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Ryan for his question. As someone who grew up in a small-business family, he knows how important affordable, reliable energy is for small businesses, as well as households and manufacturing, right across Australia. A gas-fired recovery is a key part of our JobMaker Plan, ensuring Australia is strong coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. Our competitive advantage as a nation has always relied on affordable energy, and we're taking action in three key areas to ensure that gas is delivered to Australians at the right place, the right time and at the right price as well. Those three areas are unlocking supply. As we've seen with the Narrabri project recently, the

           government has approved the Narrabri project: efficient transportation and pipelines empowering customers, making sure Australian gas is working for Australians. Gas is a critical enabler of our economy: 850,000 manufacturing jobs in this country. That includes crucial goods like fertiliser for food for Australians and people right around the world.

           , from plastics, comes from gas.
          </p>
          <p>
           There's a lot of support for our plan. Business
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
            NSW
           </a>
           has said it is a 'welcome boost' for business. Chemistry Australia says it will 'support the continued viability of Australian manufacturing'. Even the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
            AWU
           </a>
           has said of our plan, 'Anybody who wants to see an Australian manufacturing jobs boom should back it.' Even some members opposite understand that gas is central to delivering affordable, reliable energy—but only some. The member for Hunter loves gas. In response to our plan, he said, 'Hallelujah,' it's a 'win-win all around' and it 'will put downward pressure on energy prices'.
          </p>
          <p>
           But it seems that, on that side, if you like gas you get sidelined. Just last week, the Leader of the Opposition was in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
            Hunter Valley
           </a>
           with all of his Hunter Valley favourites. The member for Newcastle was there, the member for Shortland was there—he was taking time out from 'running around the countryside supporting the Greens', as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           has put it. Mr Speaker, you'll be surprised to know that the one person who wasn't there was the member for Hunter. And who could blame him? The truth is: the Leader of the Opposition is paralysed by division and indecision when it comes to gas. While they're focused on themselves, we're getting on with delivering affordable, reliable energy.
