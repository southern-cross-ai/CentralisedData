       <p>
        I have spoken before about the challenges faced by our neighbours in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        . They have some of the biggest health problems in the Pacific region, often lacking the most basic health care, and these problems are exacerbated by the terrain and remoteness of their villages. Recently I was delighted to be invited to the opening of the new Pacific International Hospital in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
         Port Moresby
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIH" rel="nofollow">
         PIH
        </a>
        has been paving the way for better health for the past 17 years; however, this new hospital will ensure even more access to healthcare services.

        Prime Minister Peter O'Neill envisaged this hospital project many years ago when he was the young executive chairman of Finance Pacific, so it was great to celebrate the opening with him on what was also his birthday. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Dr Amyna Sultan, has spent 15 years in Papua New Guinea as an eye surgeon in the private sector and a volunteer surgeon in public hospitals. It was her experience working between public and private systems that allowed her to realise the value of public-private partnership models in health care. Dr Sultan, along with her husband, Mohammed, has been the determined driving force behind this new hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first Pacific International Hospital was established in 1997 as a diagnostic centre and since then it has provided quality health care in Port Moresby. The services and treatments the PIH provides include some PNG medical firsts. It was the first to perform a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT" rel="nofollow">
         CT
        </a>
        scan. It was the first with a haemodialysis unit. In 2001 it was the first private health facility in Port Moresby to offer 24/7 emergency care. It was also the first to use mammography and has now conducted more than 3,000 free mammograms.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new hospital will offer treatment that previously has only been available offshore, including specialist services to treat diseases affecting the heart, brain, eyes and women's health. There are four operating theatres for general surgery, orthopaedics, gynaecology, cardiac surgeries and neurological surgeries. The new hospital will now also be able to offer open-heart surgery all year round and includes an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">
         MRI
        </a>
        machine. The hospital will also continue to provide a discount to public patients on MRI and cardiac studies that are unavailable at the public hospital as it has previously done with CT scan services.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are all services we take for granted in Australia, but this will make a major difference to the health of the people of Papua New Guinea. The hospital is also keen to collaborate with other health facilities to work towards making affordable, quality health care available to every Papua New Guinean. This is a massive step forward in improving the health of people who previously had no option but to go overseas or have no treatment at all. Indeed, as I have said previously, people will now want to be medivaced in to Port Moresby to access these new leading-edge health facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, I congratulate Dr Amyna and Mohammed Sultan—and I know the member for Macquarie supports me—and the PNG government not only for their determination and perseverance to make this new facility a reality but also for their continued commitment to improving health care in Papua New Guinea.
