        I appreciate there being five minutes left. I know that the member for Herbert has got to run away to finish off the haircut he has had half of.

        This, I think, is non-controversial. We noted back in 2001 that we would look at a modest increase in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
         TPI
        </a>
        pension for returned service men and women. This is a nominal amount, a $1,000 increase for the year, which is about $38.46 a fortnight, taking it up to $1,595 a fortnight. We note that there are many groups that wanted more than this, and we will stay in close contact with them. It's incredibly important that those who have served our nation are well represented and well respected, especially if they suffer from their service time an incapacity which is an affliction that impedes their greater participation in civvy street.

        We need to get this thing through basically before the end of the year for it to start at the start of next year. Its cost for the remainder of the financial year is about $14 million, and it's just shy of $100 million over the forward estimates. It's a small payment to those who have served our nation. I'll have more to say later on in the week as we head to
