       <p>
        Equality and access for all is at the heart of a truly inclusive society. It's also the foundation that inspired the creation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons" rel="nofollow">
         New Horizons
        </a>
        Tasmania over 30 years ago. The brainchild of Launceston's Robyn Hanson, New Horizons was created with the idea that sporting inclusion quite simply changes lives. Offering sport, recreational and social opportunities for Tasmanians with a disability, the club welcomes members with any disability—intellectual, physical, autism spectrum disorders and mental health issues—from ages five years and up, as well as their families. Currently, New Horizons facilitates 18 programs each week in Northern Tasmania, and new satellite programs in Hobart 48 weeks of the year. In addition, they host school holiday programs, carnivals, social functions and interstate sporting trips.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a testament to both Robyn and now her daughter Belinda, who has been at the helm since 2006, that the club has continued to succeed and thrive as new opportunities are identified for participants to learn a new skill or follow an area of passion. Members benefit hugely from their partnerships with mainstream sporting bodies, including

        Tasmania, Tennis Tasmania and

        </a>
        , as well as local clubs who lend and lease their venues and equipment and welcome play and participation among their membership. New Horizons also works in conjunction with national disability and sports organisations to provide pathways to representation for elite athletes with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been Robyn's passion and determination that has seen New Horizons members frequently represent Tasmania at an elite level, including at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Special Olympics
        </a>
        . The club has sent many athletes to participate at the Games over the last 20 years, which is an incredible achievement. Launceston will play host to the Australian Special Olympics Junior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Games" rel="nofollow">
         National Games
        </a>
        in 2020 and the National Games in 2022, which is a huge coup for our city and an opportunity all of us in the electorate of Bass can be proud of. The club is in the midst of training a number of athletes for both the junior and national games.
       </p>
       <p>
        A powerful ripple effect of New Horizons programs is the promotion of the importance of inclusion and the dynamism of people with a disability in our community. Currently the club has 462 active members, with about 70 volunteers on the books, 30 of those quite heavily involved. Almost all of the programs at New Horizons are run by their volunteers, who have given many years of service. In addition to the wonderful community members who volunteer their time, the club has also been able to reach its goals with the generosity of a number of community organisations, including local Rotary clubs and the council and those who support the club's annual fundraising event, which raises much-needed funds. I know it was particularly thrilling for the club to be chosen as the City of Launceston Lions Club charity partner for the annual Christmas parade last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing speaks more to the difference an organisation like New Horizons has on its participants, their family and the community than hearing firsthand accounts, some of which I would like to share today, on the subjects of inclusivity, confidence and creating a sense of belonging. On inclusivity: 'I wouldn't have been able to represent Australia without New Horizons club.' On confidence: 'Confidence is a big thing for me, so I've learned to be more confident, and that's been shown at work as well, which is great, because that's a big thing up at work.' On friendships and belonging: 'Making new friendships that will last a lifetime through the club has been very beneficial to me.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Just recently the club sent a wonderful team of young players to Victoria to participate in the National Cricket Inclusion Championships, held in Geelong, which provided a terrific opportunity for players to engage in a high-level championship and be lucky enough to meet
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lyon" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Well done to the team for their fantastic effort, resulting in securing third place, and I must give kudos to Victoria, who took out the championship. I'd also like to congratulate the team for raising $1,200 for bushfire relief.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a passionate supporter of the New Horizons club, and I was pleased that the Morrison government was able to provide $115,000 in funding to assist the club in the continuation of its sports programs. I commend current director Belinda Kiito, daughter of founder Robyn, on the continued growth of the club in recent years, and I look forward to continuing to work with the club in the future.
