        (1) acknowledges:

       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) condemns the Prime Minister for failing to pull the export control trigger by November 2017 to ensure that Australian households and manufacturers are not being charged exorbitant prices for Australian gas;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that the responsibility for every job lost in the manufacturing industry due to the skyrocketing price of Australian gas falls squarely with the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Energy; and

       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to act decisively now and find a solution to the gas crisis which is threatening jobs in the electoral division of Bruce and countless others around the nation.

       <p class="italic">
        (b) the draft legislation also called for pay day lenders to be barred from making continued offers of credit to vulnerable borrowers;
