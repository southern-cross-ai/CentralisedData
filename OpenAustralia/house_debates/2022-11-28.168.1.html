        What a fabulous year it has been on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . I take this opportunity to wish all Gold Coasters a fabulous Christmas, a wonderful time with family and friends and a wonderful break.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         The Gold Coast
        </a>
        , as we know, is one of the greatest destinations on earth, with a vibrant community, a growing multicultural community, incredible facilities, marvellous weather, extraordinary beaches and, importantly, great people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have a few shout-outs for our community groups. The Cycling Without Age Gold Coast chapter has seen an exceptional year of growth. It's now one of the largest chapters in Australia. This year they purchased a wheelchair-accessible trishaw, which is superb for inclusivity. I give a big shout-out to Wayne Sticher, who started the Gold Coast chapter. He is an extraordinary Gold Coaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        I give another big shout-out to the Alberton Ormeau Cricket Club, the Hurricanes. Their all-inclusive junior team for children with disability has gone from strength to strength. They're proud winners of a community cricket award, taking out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Cricket" rel="nofollow">

        diversity and inclusion award. Well done to Lisa Wells and the entire team, who are champions in our community, and to Lisa Wells' mum, who has championed just so many things in that area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank our Rotary clubs for the great work they're doing, especially the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Hope Island
        </a>
        for their remembrance island, where I spent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        this year, and for the wonderful work they're doing in concert with Mulpha. I thank Sandra Doumany, the past district president, for her extensive service to Rotary. Of course, she received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        in recognition of that service, matching what her wonderful husband, Sam Doumany, has done. He has also been recognised in award ceremonies in previous years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the men's sheds for what they're doing, and I wish the new leadership all the best. I thank our multicultural groups, especially our Indian communities, who are going from strength to strength. I'm so looking forward to their new facility and their new place of worship, which is being built at Arundel. I look forward to going there for the opening.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish all of our Gold Coast schools and our year-12s who are finishing now all the very best. Well done on your exams and all the very best for your futures. I turn now to the schoolies. Queensland schoolies have finished.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        schoolies are now partaking of our world-class beaches. Be safe. Take care of each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank our businesses for employing Australians. Youth unemployment is at seven per cent, women's unemployment is at its lowest level in history and women's participation is at its highest level in history. This is a legacy of the Morrison government. So, businesses, thank you for the work you're putting in.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of our election commitments, exits 41, 45 and 49 are being built, exit 38 is next, the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is delivering for the Gold Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, to Fran Ward Emerson: happy birthday. Have a great day today.
