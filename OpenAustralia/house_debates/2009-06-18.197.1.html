        There are certain elements in this nation that seem to be trying to undermine the strengths of Australia. I count in that list those who forever demand or promote their rights without firstly acknowledging the responsibilities they have to our country as citizens. These people stand on the other side of the spectrum from the principle of personal responsibility. They are the people who blame society, who blame a perceived belief of past injustices or who otherwise take the easy path of finding anyone but themselves responsible for problems in their own life. It is a disturbing ethos that is worth opposing for the good of this country. By not critically examining our own shortcomings, we neglect the main obstacle to becoming the best person we can be. I see it as something akin to superstition where one’s fate is seen as outside one’s own control. Blaming someone or something is an easy way to avoid responsibility and, therefore, is an excuse for not trying harder or doing the work needed to succeed in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        One aspect of this can be seen in our society when we walk along the street and see something that should be fixed. It may be something dangerous to others, it may even be a crime being committed or it may be some sort of security issue; but, in any case, it is something that needs to be acted upon. It is my view that too many people see these threats or problems as someone else’s responsibility. They do not see themselves as having any form of responsibility in the matter. Typically, I have heard people say: ‘Someone is paid to do that,’ or ‘I don’t have time to do something about it.’ That is exactly the sort of attitude that perpetuates suburban decay and toleration of increasing levels of crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        In opposition to such attitudes I established my community awareness initiative, known as the Junior Cowan Community Watch, to promote the sense of personal responsibility amongst young people in Cowan that is so important to achieve the best Australia that we can have. I have well over 100 members in the team and I would like to reflect on the good work they do in reporting things that need to be fixed in our community of Cowan.

        Firstly, I acknowledge Mikaela Armstrong of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Greenwood Senior High School
        </a>
        for her reports about issues at Barridale Park in Kingsley. Also at the same school, Matt Willoughby has reported safety hazards at the Kingsway Sporting Complex in Madeley. It is not the first time that I have mentioned the good work of Teah Arrowsmith of Landsdale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        for her reports of graffiti, hooning and infrastructure issues in her suburb of Landsdale.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Koondoola, the suburb is well-supported by local advocates and good community members

        and Jayden Tonaro. Tony and Jayden are from Waddington Primary School and have demonstrated an interest in better parks and facilities in their suburb. I would also say that Waddington Primary School has strongly supported my initiative with the Junior Cowan Community Watch and has contributed the most members of any school at 24. That is not bad for the smallest school in the electorate of Cowan. I think that their efforts are a testament to the character of the young people at the school and also to the leadership of the senior class teacher,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cunningham" rel="nofollow">

        , the Principal, Phil Chaloner, and the Deputy Principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Morgan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I am pleased to be a supporter of the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we are looking at strong commitment to a better and safer community, it is hard to go past the dedication demonstrated by the students of Hocking Primary School. I refer to the leadership shown by Megan and Jade McLoughlin, Melissa Tran,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Stacey Smith
        </a>
        , Madeline Nurse and the newest team member, Sarah Rodo. In looking at reports submitted by the Hocking Primary School students they are doing an excellent job and, although I have previously spoken about that school, I again congratulate them for their dedication and efforts on behalf of their suburb.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday I was at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anthony" rel="nofollow">
         St Anthony
        </a>
        ’s Primary School in Wanneroo to acknowledge the membership of Sam Dulyba. Although I am yet to receive any reports from Sam, I look forward to hearing his views on Wanneroo, and I look forward to future members from St Anthony’s Primary School. It is also appropriate that I acknowledge the leadership of the Principal, Peter Cutrona, for the work he does for the children and for the wider school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is little doubt that I think this country is let down badly by those that think only of their rights without mentioning their responsibilities. The main responsibility is always personal responsibility, without which none of us can ever reach our full potential. I have, however, demonstrated that there are a lot of young people in Cowan who appreciate their sense of responsibility to the community and who have a sense of personal responsibility as well. It is for that reason I have great hope for the future, and I am proud of the next generation because this country will be in very good hands if the examples shown by these young people are followed by their peers.
