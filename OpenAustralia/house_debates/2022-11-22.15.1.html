        Today I rise to read a question from a young constituent from my electorate who won the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign. He writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Edward Sethaphanich. I currently reside in the electorate of Mackellar. As the new parliament begins with the intention of promoting grassroot democracy, world peace and stability, members of parliament and senators should have the common interest of addressing the current state of this nation, as Australians face financial vulnerabilities and societal fears which stemmed from the effects of natural phenomenons which were once considered "once in a lifetime" events.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 47th parliament, members and senators alike should aim to achieve legislation that would radically improve our healthcare system as the system currently does not have the capacity to facilitate high quality health services on an affordable level.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also through this that members and senators in the 47th parliament should aim to implement large-scale monetary and fiscal corrections to ensure the stability of the Australian economy while alleviating the insecurities posed by rising inflation and global events.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, an outcome which Australians together desire from this parliament is the genuine consideration of our ever changing climate and measures which could avoid the extinction of our society and the world.

          Youth Voice
         </a>
         in Parliament campaign run by Raise Our Voice Australia. This is a fantastic initiative which brings young Australian voices into the nation's parliament. This is a speech by Joel from the Hunter electorate:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My hope for the new Parliament is for it to achieve great progress and reform by working together towards the common goal of improving the lives and future of Australians.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I have a firm belief that Australia is the greatest country in the world, however, I am also aware of its downsides and where we are falling behind.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A country may be great, but it can always improve. I believe this new Parliament must ensure that it works together and makes great strides towards combatting the impacts of climate change and setting Australia up to be a role model in the creation and use of renewable energy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My electorate of the Hunter especially must see great change, for our local economy and the lives of the local people.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Parliament must also help these new energy sectors grow but it is equally responsible to ensure that workers are not left behind.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A successful country must not leave anyone behind.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, Joel. Thank you for sending this through to us. We really appreciate it.

          I'm proud to deliver this speech written by Poppy Kidd, aged 17, as part of Raise Our Voice Australia. Poppy says, 'As a young person, I think about how what parliament achieves today will influence what we accomplish in the future. There are always going to be new problems arising and we need sustainable solutions. So why are our youth, one of our most important assets to ensuring Australia's future, failing to meet current standards? Research shows Australian students are increasingly underprepared for their futures, with less participation in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
           STEM
          </a>
          subjects and languages other than English. Australia's youth will be the next people in this room. We will be nurses that care for you, entrepreneurs that grow our economy and scientists creating vaccines. However,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA" rel="nofollow">
           PISA
          </a>
          tests show that many Australian students are lacking in basic literacy and numeracy skills. This parliament needs to grow Australia's public education system by addressing the teacher shortage and creating equal access to quality education. We need to improve our curriculum so students have the knowledge to face the challenges of a rapidly changing world. It's impossible for this parliament to solve all of the issues, but it can change what we accomplish in the future by investing in our youth.' Thanks, Poppy.

           advocate. It is tricky to live with type 1 diabetes but I have to deal with it. When my blood sugar levels are really high or really low I find it hard to think or act normal. It is also hard for me to find new places to inject insulin because the skin on my body gets so sore from so many needles. Management of diabetes is always there and is hard for me but having a continuous glucose monitor,

            CGM
           </a>

I feel very lucky to live in a country where this important technology is available to all those with type 1 diabetes. I look forward to the new parliament's support to turn type 1 into type none, so that no-one has to live with diabetes anymore. Please continue clinical research networks to find a cure for type 1 diabetes so that we don't have to keep dealing with it. I know that research holds the key and that scientists can find a cure someday. Thank you for your time today.' I would also like to congratulate his mother Kylie Greenfield, who is the JDRF national volunteer of the year.

            'Mental health. Sitting in the corner not knowing what is going to come next. Will it be my fear or my concerns? Why is it never my dreams, my happy place? Does it always have to be worried and bad times? Something good would be nice for a change. Treacherous thoughts running through my head, mad am I, all alone, mindless of my surroundings. I want to dissolve into the atmosphere one part of my body at time until I'm as thin as air and go swish in the wind. Mum's always worrying if I'm okay. She thinks I am hurt. Checking in on me every day. Fighting fears, fighting concerns. It feels like I am trapped in a dark, empty room trying to get out. Waves of emotion. Every day I swim through gloomy waters. I can never see the shore. Hope and luck, things I don't have at the end of the day. I hate my body in every single way. Depression is a silent film. Underwater where nobody can help I am drowning because I won't talk about it. I cannot get out of my bed. Anxiety is always holding me hostage inside my hurting head. When people ask me, "Where am I?" they should just ask, "Where have I gone?" I don't have hope. I am dwelling in my darkness. What is hope? I have forgotten how it feels to smile and laugh. But I know joy will find me and let me run free. And I know that I am perfectly imperfect. I cannot go through these things alone. And hopefully out of the darkness help will come.'

             On the 21st of May, Australians voted for change. Changing our childcare and aged care system to be more friendly to kids, residents and families. Changing our constitution to recognize the people that have inhabited our wide brown land for 60,000 years, and changing our head of state to be elected by the people, for the people and be of the people.

             <p class="italic">
              When looking at the prompt for this year's voices to parliament, "What should Australia's new parliament accomplish?" my initial thought was action, whether that be on climate change, income inequality or a plethora of other issues.

             <p class="italic">
              But as I sat there, I realised that what the 47th parliament of Australia should accomplish is simple. Unity.
