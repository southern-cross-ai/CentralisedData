       <p>
        On 19 May, Canberra lost one of its great citizens:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Wood" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Wood
        </a>
        , former minister in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        government, was 88 years old. Bill had a distinguished political career. The son of a leader of the Queensland parliamentary Labor Party, he was a whip's dream or nightmare, serving in the Queensland's parliament alongside his identical twin brother, Peter.
       </p>
       <p>
        He subsequently moved to Canberra, and in 1989 was elected to the very first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         ACT Legislative Assembly
        </a>
        , eventually representing the seat of Brindabella. He went from doorknocking on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Thursday Island
        </a>
        to doorknocking in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuggeranong_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Tuggeranong Valley
        </a>
        . During his time in the Legislative Assembly, Bill served as minister across several portfolios, including arts, urban services, housing and education. So keen was Bill to make an impact on the first day of the new parliament that he leapt to his feet and spoke in the chamber without leave of the Speaker. He served in the assembly until 2004, and then continued to play a significant role across the community. Bill was a man of great integrity in action and in word. The success and longevity of the current ACT government and the stability in federal representation owe much to his work with like-minded colleagues in the late nineties.
       </p>
       <p>
        I express deep condolences to Bill's wife, Bev, and their family, and to Bill's former staff and friends right across the Labor movement.
