       <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity to update the House on three major projects the coalition had committed to, prior to the new government being elected, that are within my electorate of Capricornia. These projects are in the budget, and I have major concerns that the new federal Labor government will pull the funding. The wealth of the nation comes from regions like Capricornia, and we expect a fair share of funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government committed $14.4 million to replace the Phillips Creek Bridge on Saraji Road. Consistent with the usual funding arrangements for regional projects, this $18 million project will need the Queensland government to fund the remaining 20 per cent, which is $3.6 million. Saraji Road is a key link between Dysart and Moranbah, north-west of Rockhampton. Mining businesses in the region rely heavily on the route to get their products to market. A replacement bridge will make the highway safer and more flood resilient and keep motorists, coal and agricultural produce moving.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition put money on the table because we know how important this project is to motorists, businesses and the economy. When the trucks stop, so do the royalties. They pay for all the services all Australians rely on. And that's why we're pushing to get this project done. This project will also provide an important economic boost for local communities, supporting an expected 42 jobs during construction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition will always support our resources sector, but the importance of these businesses to our economy seems lost on the Labor state government, which has so far shown no interest in this vital project. I am calling on the Labor government to provide $3.6 million for the Phillips Creek Bridge replacement. I'm also calling on them to do so to ensure the safety of motorists and miners alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to mention the Nebo Showgrounds Masterplan in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Isaac Region
        </a>
        , another project located in my electorate of Capricornia. As the federal member for Capricornia, I made a commitment of $2.8 million towards the funding of this essential upgrade. The first stage of this project includes primary infrastructure upgrades, construction of heavy vehicle access, general camping upgrades and car parking. The Nebo Showgrounds are one of the Isaac Region's most utilised recreation facilities. They are home to Australia's biggest one-day rodeo, attracting 5,000 people from across regional Australia. The showgrounds are hired for more than 80 days of the year, to cater for over 20,000 people, and deliver an estimated local economic return of $1.2 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        This investment in the Nebo Showgrounds has the potential to attract a higher level of visitation from neighbouring regions and across the country. The national events held in Nebo, like the Nebo Rodeo, play a vital role in supporting the agriculture sector. Communities in regional Australia are built on places like the Nebo Showgrounds. The upgrade of the Nebo Showgrounds is an important project for the residents of Nebo and the surrounding areas. The federal Labor government needs to deliver on this funding and recognise the value and economic potential the Nebo Showgrounds deliver to the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to update the House on the $100,000 in funding I committed to the Collinsville Queensland Country Women's Association, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCWA" rel="nofollow">
         QCWA
        </a>
        . The coalition delivered a commitment of $325,000 in 2019 to build a new hall. The initial builder has pulled out, with building costs on the rise. The project costs have increased significantly. The ongoing effects of COVID and the strain it has created within the building sector have also contributed to the increased cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new QCWA hall will provide a meeting place for the community, for everything from dancing lessons to local business and organisations, and, of course, for the QCWA to utilise. The entire community will benefit from a newly constructed QCWA hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        The QCWA has enabled communities to connect and provide invaluable networks and initiatives that have worked for the common good across Australia since it started. The federal Labor government needs to recognise the invaluable role the QCWA has played in Australian regional and rural communities and deliver on the funding needed to complete this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        To not deliver on funding for these vital projects would serve as an example of the lack of real understanding Labor have of the livelihood and essential services regional areas deserve. It is time for the federal Labor government to stand up for Australia's regional and rural communities and commit to delivering on these important projects that will contribute to the future economic growth of regional Australia.
