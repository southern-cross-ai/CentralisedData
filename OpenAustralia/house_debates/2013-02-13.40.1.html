       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words in tribute to a constituent of mine,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Jenny Murray
        </a>
        , who lost her battle with cancer earlier this year. Jenny was a stalwart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Highlands" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Highlands
        </a>
        branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        , with more than 38 years continuous membership of the party. She focused her energy on her beloved family, her wide network of friends, her garden and actively campaigning in her community whenever a cause arose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenny and her late husband, Fraser, were both teachers and they shared a passion for the power of education to transform young lives. At a time when dedicated services for women were close to non-existent, Jenny, an avowed feminist, advocated for women's health services, child care and many other causes close to home and nationally. Jenny was a Labor woman to her core, and the Labor Party was fortunate to have someone of her capacity and commitment in its midst.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to her close friend and other mainstay of the Southern Highlands branch, Joan Yeo, Jenny gave one of her sons, Jim, the middle name of Edward as a tribute to her hero,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Edward Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        . On election days, Jenny would usually be found at the Mittagong Preschool booth, her favourite base for encouraging Labor votes in any election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenny will be deeply missed by her family, her friends—like her dear friends Joan Yeo and Jenny Reidy, whose touching eulogies have assisted me with my tribute today—and her Southern Highlands branch colleagues. Jenny's passion for Labor and a life well lived is a tribute to her energy and commitment to making the world a better place and to improving the lives of us all.
