       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to two outstanding members of our community who sadly recently lost battles with ill health. I recognise two great people of the mighty suburb of Inala: Ross

         McKay
        </a>
        and Jono Johnston. Both of these legends contributed greatly to my community, were good friends and were the truest of true believers. They were staunch advocates for our community and contributors for decades to the great

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_McKay" rel="nofollow">
         Ross McKay
        </a>
        was a gifted educator who taught in local schools in the Oxley electorate. Ross truly understood the transformational power of education. He was devoted to his wonderful family—his wife, Sandy, children, Kathryn and Ken, and his much-loved granddaughters, Penelope and Siobhan—who are continuing Ross's deep commitment to social justice in the work they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jono Johnston lived in Inala for many years and was a stalwart of our community. He was a character of life in his own time, a straight-shooter and an amazing community activist, particularly through his leadership of the Blue Fin Fishing Club, the largest and best fishing club in Australia. I send my condolences to Jon's wife, Sharyn, and his whole family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Ross and Jono gave me enormous guidance and support in my time as a councillor and, of course, in becoming elected to the federal parliament. I speak for many of our community when I say that both will be missed and that both will be remembered for many years to come. Rest in peace, Ross McKay and Jon Johnston.
