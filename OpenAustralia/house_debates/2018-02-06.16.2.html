        Vale, Mary Crean, a Labor legend who passed away on 28 January aged 103 years. Mary had a rich, full lifeâ€”much of it devoted to our party and to our movement. Mary was the matriarch of a family of Labor warriors. She was fiercely loyal to her husband of 63 years,

        </a>
        for 26 years, and to her sons:

        , who was a public servant.

        Mary was a spear carrier for our movement. Her political smarts gained the respect of some of the most senior people in our party, who were known to seek her out to discuss the political issues of the day. She was passionate, compassionate, smart and loyal. She was a great contributor. Had she been born in this century she might have had a shot at being Prime Minister herself.

        Mary devoted her life to others from the local kindergarten to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        of Victoria. The community I serve in Victoria and the movement and the party I represent in this parliament owe Mary a great deal. She was a stellar human being and deeply respected on both sides of politics, so I know I speak for all of us in the chamber today when I send the chamber's deepest condolences to the Crean family and our great respect and thanks to Mary for all that she contributed and achieved. May she rest in peace.
