        , AM. I'd like firstly to congratulate the Hon. Graham Mullane AM, for his significant contributions to the judiciary, law and our community. Mr Mullane holds the distinction of being the first judge appointed from the Hunter region, in 1986. For over two decades, he dedicated his judicial service to family law at the Newcastle Registry of the Family Court of Australia. His commendable community leadership includes involvement with

        and advocacy for the most vulnerable. The chairing of esteemed organisations like the

        Heartfelt congratulations to Mr Sean Gordon AM for his remarkable dedication to

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Gordon" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Gordon

        , with a focus on education and representation. His involvement in the First Nations Constitutional Convention, which produced the Uluru Statement from the Heart, is testament to his instrumental role in advancing Indigenous rights. This historic statement has paved the way for the upcoming referendum to enshrine a First Nations Voice to Parliament in our Constitution. We honour Sean Gordon's courage and leadership with this well-deserved award.
