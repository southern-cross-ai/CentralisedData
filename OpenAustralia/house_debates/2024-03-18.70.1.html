       <p>
        I am very proud that the Albanese Labor government has made specific positive changes to education in support of students and teachers, including the commitment to making Australia's education system better and fairer by working with all states and territories to ensure every school is on a path to 100 per cent of its fair funding level.

        Today I speak in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        , the national assessment program, which is a literacy and numeracy assessment for primary students in years 3 and 5 and secondary students in years 7 and 9. NAPLAN commenced last week, and I want to send my very best wishes to all the students in Pearce and Australia wide who are taking part and to their teachers, who do an amazing job. It's important to regularly check how well students are learning the essential skills of reading, writing and numeracy as they progress throughout their school years. NAPLAN assesses the literacy and numeracy skills that students are learning through the school curriculum, and it allows parents and carers an opportunity to see how their children are progressing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to know that NAPLAN is just one aspect of a school's assessment and reporting process. It does not replace ongoing assessments made by teachers about student performances. All students have the opportunity to participate in the program, which takes into consideration students with disabilities who have diverse functional abilities and needs. I congratulate all those students and teachers and wish them all the very best for NAPLAN.
