        My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his commitment in question time yesterday to examine the private member’s bill put forward by the member for Warringah and me to see what practical things can be done to assist the Australian civilian victims of overseas terrorism. Does that mean, Prime Minister, that you are indeed considering special help for them along the lines flagged in the bill or are Australian civilian terror victims only to be helped as a part of a possible future national disability scheme, which gives no more help to the Australians civilian casualties of war on terror than it does to slip and fall cases?

          So I ask the Prime Minister on behalf of Paul Anicich and Tony Purkiss, victims of the Bali bomb blast, who I understand he met with yesterday: has he rejected our proposal to give Australian civilian casualties of the war on terror support and instead is doing nothing special for them at all?

           The member for Paterson asked a question and in it he referred to those who were victims of ‘slip and fall’, as if this was not a category of injury about which this parliament should be concerned. I would strongly suggest that the honourable member seek to change those words later in question time, because I think the honourable member needs to reflect long and hard on the tens and hundreds of thousands of Australians who are looking very carefully at the need for assistance in the categories that we spoke about in the answer just given by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in question time today. This is a very difficult area of long-term reform. The social insurance model that she has referred to in her question, in terms of long-term disability reform, has now been the subject of a reference specifically to the

                    The honourable member asked about the contents of a private member’s bill which was put to the parliament yesterday. Against that inquiry, which I foreshadowed last night at the National Disability Awards and which was referred to in question time today by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, I say again strongly to the member for Paterson that when he refers to slip and fall cases in the way in which he has he should think very long and hard about the number of Australians who find themselves subject to significant impairment and disability.

                          Yesterday after the honourable members introduced their private member’s bill the honourable member for Warringah, having asked me a question about it in the chamber, brought around to my office two individuals who had been victims of one of the Bali bombings and asked if I would meet them. He did so without giving any notice, and I would not have expected him to give any notice. I was of course delighted to come out and meet them and spend some time talking to them. Furthermore, I had no prior notice, as I said yesterday, about the proposed introduction of the bill to which the honourable members have referred, but I understand that the honourable member’s bill seeks to provide a payment of $75,000 for those who fall victim to international terrorist attacks. At this stage it is difficult for the government to foreshadow what the

                          may or may not recommend as being appropriate for all categories of disability and impairment which would flow from the scheme which has been the subject of the reference to the

                          </a>
                          . Therefore, it is important that we await the PC’s conclusions.

                         <p>
                          It was only yesterday in this parliament that the honourable members introduced a private member’s bill. An hour later the honourable member brought around to me two individuals who had been affected directly by one of these bombings and I made a point of going out almost immediately to meet with them. On top of that, reflecting directly upon the conversation we had with those individuals—and I made reference to those individuals in the speech I gave last night at the National Disability Awards—I would say that for individuals such as those persons we should also consider how and by what means any future social insurance scheme of the type which has been referred to by the families minister in question time today could address those and other needs.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          On top of that, as I said yesterday in question time in response to the member for Warringah, we maintain an open mind as to what forms of practical assistance we can provide to Australians who are victims of international terrorist attacks. That is the spirit which the government brings to bear in seeking to deal with this sensitive set of problems, as we are seeking to deal with other sensitive problems concerning those who have suffered comprehensive disability and other forms of disability.
