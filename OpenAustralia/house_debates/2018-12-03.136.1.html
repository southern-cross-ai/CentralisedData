       <p>
        On Saturday, I had the honour of attending the 31st annual parade of 331 Squadron,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Air_Force_Cadets" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Air Force Cadets
        </a>
        , in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        . The 331 Squadron has a proud history of turning out fine young Australians over many years. The cadet movement is not just a source of potential recruits to our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        ; it is a great youth development organisation. Cadet units build qualities that are of benefit in later life: service to the community, discipline, self-confidence and working as a team, to name just a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the parade ground, the cadets were a credit to their unit, watched by officers, proud parents and supporters. The reviewing officer, Group Captain James Gibson, was impressed by the precision of the parade, as were the audience. It was a credit to the unit staff, in particular Cadet Flight Lieutenant Deborah Hoiles, who, regrettably, was unable to attend due to family commitments. I would like to acknowledge parade commander Cadet Flight Sergeant Blake Hall and parade warrant officer Cadet Flight Sergeant Benjamin Ranford. The banner warrant officer was Cadet Sergeant Nicholas Winkler. The banner bearer was Cadet Sergeant Eden Millar-Waldock. The banner escorts were cadet corporals Emily White and Reece Rainbow.

        -Flight commander was Cadet Sergeant Keegan Ford, and the B-Flight commander was Cadet Corporal Daniel Alford.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cadets were kept in time not only by hours of drill and hard work but through the fine contribution made by the Coffs Coast Pipes and Drums, who are on hand at so many community events along the Coffs Coast. The 331 Squadron cadets routinely help out at a range of commemorations held in our region. In return, there were representatives from various ex-service groups in attendance, including the Australian National Servicemen's Association and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branches from around the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the parade, Cadet of the Year for 2017 and Cadet of the Year for 2018 were announced. I would like to congratulate Cadet Sergeant Keegan Ford for being awarded Cadet of the Year for 2017 and Cadet Flight Sergeant Blake Hall for Cadet of the Year for 2018. All were impressed by the dedication and hard work of the staff and cadets of 331 Squadron. They are a credit to the long and proud history of 331.
