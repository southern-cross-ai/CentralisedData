        As the member for Macquarie, I use every opportunity I can to help community groups in my electorate with small grant funding, and I want to give a shout-out to some of those it's been a pleasure to recommend and support in the last year or so. These organisations stretch the funds they get with volunteer labour and in-kind generosity. Whether they're sporting clubs or the arts, community services or hobby and social groups, they all play a really vital role in connecting our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been very pleased to support, in the upper part of the mountains, Blackheath Men's Shed with a very practical box trailer. It's something you don't need often but is vital when you do, and this one can be used by members and to help the community. The Robyn Yates wellness centre is receiving $20,000 to revitalise and make improvements to its Leura premises so it can better support the people it helps as they're being treated for cancer. Blue Mountains Wildplant Rescue Service now has a lovely new website. You should check it out, Madam Deputy Speaker, to see what's available. Again, it's a volunteer-run organisation.

        As we move down the mountains, I was pleased to support Winmalee Neighbourhood Centre in keeping their place cooler. And Winmalee Rural Fire Brigade has been able to upgrade its

        has received funding for new gardening equipment and to repair and enlarge enclosures. Over the last six years, they've grown from a few beds to a very large productive garden, but no doubt, like at my garden a few streets away, the wallabies, possums and bandicoots need to be kept out. The Lower Mountains Junior Rugby League Club have received $20,000 for seating at their Warrimoo field. And those clever kids at Springwood &amp; District Citizens,

The North West Magpies have been able to purchase new sporting equipment, while the Oakville Raiders Baseball Club has received $15,000 for spectator seating. The Jeremiah Project were able to buy really necessary tables and chairs for their important Hawkesbury Community Kitchen meals services, and the Kingsford Smith Village Community Shed, in

        These are a sample of Stronger Communities grants across all ages and all parts of the electorate. It is a delight to be able to support these organisations in a small way to do the work they're doing.
