        It's a great pleasure to report to the House that I officially opened the new Headway Acquired Brain Injury Australia WINGS Wellbeing Centre at Molendinar on Wednesday, 23 August, during Brain Injury Awareness Week. Headway provides life-enhancing support for the development of locals who have an acquired brain injury, as well as support for their friends, family and the wider community. They make rehabilitation an interesting and positive experience. The new WINGS Wellbeing Centre has a weightless gym and the latest physical therapy tools. These facilities are accessible to anyone with a functional impairment or chronic health condition. I saw their Jintronix system, which includes therapeutic games and functional assessments for all ages. The system assists functional development and recovery and is a fun way for people to get moving. I also saw their amazing ICARE machines that are changing people's lives. The machines take a person's weight and help to move their legs so they can feel what it's like to walk again. This is taking 21st century technology, as well as gaming technology, to assist those who are recovering from difficult conditions. There are some wonderful and inspirational stories of recovery after brain injury, including one from a young man who now helps others with their rehabilitation at the Headway WINGS Wellbeing Centre. It was wonderful to be there. It's a great community that is working together to support those with acquired brain injury. I wish them all the best for the future.
