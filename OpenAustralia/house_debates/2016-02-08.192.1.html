       <p>
        When I first became a member and I was thinking about the strategic plan for Mallee, I put it under two phrases: 'building wealth by building opportunities and capacity' and 'building communities by building interaction'. The Stronger Communities Program has turned out to be exactly that.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have had five announcements that I can talk about now that are really about building that community interaction. The Great Western Football Netball Club is going to receive $9,777 to upgrade its kitchen facilities. That club only got back on its feet about four years ago. The Irymple Junior Football Netball Club is going to get a barbecue trailer and some marquees—$5,500. For the golfers; the Warracknabeal Golf Club is going to get $6,136 so that when the golfers come in after playing their golf they can get in front of those heaters, or air conditioners in the summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not only for the sportsmen. For those who like to enjoy water sports, the Wooroonook Lakes Foreshore is going to get a fence—$13,795. This means that those who are playing at the lake can also be protected, so they do not go out and walk across the road—a potential danger to our children. And the Swan Hill District Agricultural and Pastoral Society is going to get $5,527 for some air conditioners and some photocopiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is building communities, it is getting people together and it is something that is really special about the people who I represent—the people of the Wimmera and the Mallee.
