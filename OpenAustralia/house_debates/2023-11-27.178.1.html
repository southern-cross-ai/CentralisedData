        A report for the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club redevelopment project will be presented to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        council meeting tomorrow night. As vice-patron of the surf club, I strongly support the recommendations contained in the report by the city's administration for the council to approve option 1.1, at an estimated cost of $14.87 million. I respectfully urge all councillors to support the officers' recommendation. I note that $8 million in funding has been committed by the WA state government, with the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club making a $1 million contribution, leaving the City of Joondalup to fund the remaining $5.87 million as part of its forward capital works program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Founded in 1958, the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club is one of the largest sporting clubs in my electorate, with a membership of more than 2,200 members. In order to meet the needs of the current and forecasted membership base, support the development of junior members and provide the necessary training and community services, it is necessary to construct a modern clubroom facility for our club. The current clubhouse is more than 40 years old and past its use-by date. Public funds invested to provide functional modern facilities for the lifesavers who patrol our popular beaches, keeping our communities safe, represent a sound investment. The surf club redevelopment has been in process for several years; however, it has been frustratingly slow. The project should be expedited, with key milestones agreed upon to achieve timely completion, in line with community expectations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surf lifesaving is a community service which literally saves lives on our beaches. Our lifesavers are operating from cramped facilities which are more than 40 years old. When it comes to surf lifesaving, as an essential community service, it does not make sense to penny pinch or allow party political agendas to get in the way of what is best for our whole community. I will not go into the details, as the political jockeying has been reported in the newspapers.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club, and in the best interests of our whole community, I strongly support the recommendation of the city's administration for the council to approve option 1.1. I respectfully call upon all councillors to vote for the officers' recommendation.
