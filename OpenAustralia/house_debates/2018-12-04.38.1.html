        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government's actions to build a stronger economy, without increasing taxes, are delivering the essential services regional Australia needs? What impact would an alternative approach to economic management have on electorates like Calare?

         I thank the member for Calare for his question. On 2 April next year the Treasurer is going to stand on this spot and deliver a surplus budget—the first surplus budget for more than a decade. Labor has not produced such a budget for more than 30 years. That is a disgrace, and everybody knows it. Next year we are going to, without raising taxes, deliver a surplus budget and deliver the essential services that Australians rely on, expect and deserve. That is certainly beneficial for the people who live in Calare and those who live in regional Australia.

         People who live in many regional areas of Australia are doing it tough at the moment. They have the effects of the drought. They are beset by the drought. We are putting on the table $1 million each for the 81 local government areas with drought stricken communities. That's going to bring forward works to create local jobs and keep money flowing around those communities. I know that councils in the member for Calare's electorate, including Blayney, Mid-Western Regional, Cabonne, Oberon and Dubbo Regional, are preparing applications at the moment as our investment gets to work in other communities across the nation—certainly in those drought affected communities in Queensland,

         and Victoria and lately in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         —to build the infrastructure they now need and to help keep money flowing in the towns. We've found that when you have a drought people leave town to look for employment. We want to keep employment opportunities in those council areas.

         Projects, like doing up the community hall in Brewarrina, are so important. It's going to get air conditioning and new audiovisual equipment. It's in the Parkes electorate. It's only a little community. We're providing that sort of support. The Brewarrina hall is used by the

         for gymnastics, concerts and movie screenings as well as gatherings, such as funeral wakes. We are working with council to install air-conditioning and to make sure local contractors, local people, are getting part of that work.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also investing in projects such as the standpipe upgrades at Parkes.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Parkes Shire Council
         </a>
         is providing domestic and stock water free of charge for rural residents, who make up nearly a third of the shire's population, from council standpipes across the shire. It is something we are helping them to deliver. We are partnering with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilpie_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Quilpie Shire Council
         </a>
         . I know the Prime Minister is well versed about Quilpie. He has been there. On his first day on the job as Prime Minister he went there. He listened to the people. We have responded. We have responded with that million dollars going throughout those 81 local government areas. At Quilpie they are going to help properties build wild dog exclusion fencing to lift lambing rates from as low as 17 per cent to upwards of 80 per cent. You can do that when you have a strong economy. What those opposite will deliver if they ever get back into government is a poorer economy.
