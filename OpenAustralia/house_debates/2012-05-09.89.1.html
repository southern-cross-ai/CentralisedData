       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) under current State and Territory legislation, a coroner does not have the statutory and judicial authority to investigate stillbirths, nor does the legislation (except in Queensland) indicate that coronial jurisdiction extends to stillbirths; and

        (2) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) approximately one per cent of babies born every year in Australia are stillborn (cited from a

        </a>

        (3) calls on the Government to:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) adopt policies and protocols that are consistent amongst the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) provide clear and consistent definitions of 'person', 'death' and 'stillbirth', and extend this to other relevant legislation such as the births, deaths and marriages Acts;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) promote the need and development of perinatal specialists in investigations as has been recommended by independent groups such as the Australian and

        (iv) allow for public coronial inquiry to assist in identifying clinically important lessons from the death and contribute to research on the topic of stillbirths and early infant death; and

       <p class="italic">
        (v) enhance provisions that provide support and appropriate care for parents. (Notice given 21 March 2012.)

       <p class="italic">
        (a) food allergy affects approximately 1 in 10 children and 2 in 100 adults, and anaphylaxis is the most severe form of an allergic reaction, most commonly food associated anaphylaxis; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the number of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis has doubled in the last 15 years and there have been increased incidences of anaphylaxis predominantly in infants less than 5 years of age, with studies indicating that increases have been up to five-fold;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that current State and Territory policies related to food allergy management in schools are not properly legislated, except in Victoria;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges that an anaphylactic reaction should be treated as a medical emergency and a simple medical procedure is all that is needed to treat it, prevent loss of life and provide the necessary time to transport the victim to hospital for further medical attention;

       <p class="italic">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">

        (c) ensure staff members are appropriately trained to support life in the event of an anaphylactic reaction; and

       <p class="italic">
        (d) have an anaphylaxis management program for each student developed in consultation with the student's parent/carer and physician;

       <p class="italic">
        (5) recognises the great work of Murdoch Children's Research Institute and Asthma Victoria in the 'Schoolnuts' study which aims to determine the prevalence of true food allergies in children and provide educational seminars to schools following research; and

       <p class="italic">
