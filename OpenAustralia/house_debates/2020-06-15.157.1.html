        Volunteers around Australia make up an enormous contribution to communities, and I'd like to acknowledge some of the volunteers in Reid who have received support from the Morrison government so that they may continue to do the good work in our community. In total, 16 local community groups in Reid have received a share of the $9 million of federal funding through the Morrison government's Volunteer Grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        This funding is supporting vital work for our community across a range of sectors. Volunteers across our local Scout groups have received a boost. The 1st Yaralla Sea Scout Group in Rhodes have received $1,200 for an

        upgrade, while the 1st Cabarita Mortlake Scout Group will be able to purchase a new fridge with their $1,500 grant. These small amounts of funding will make a big difference to the big picture of the work that Scout groups do, which provides opportunities for outdoor skill development and youth leadership programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers of various faith based groups in Reid in our area have received assistance, with a focus on community based support, intervention and assistance. St Bakhita Centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebush_West" rel="nofollow">
         Homebush West
        </a>
        received a grant of $2,500 to cover the training costs and fuel costs for the volunteers of the Homebush West organisation. They support over 500 students within Sydney's Sudanese Australian community to access study, apprenticeships, traineeships and employment opportunities post graduation. Volunteers especially focus on the education of Sudanese women who often have not had the opportunity to attend school, teaching them English and computer literacy, among other classes, so that women have the opportunity to learn.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Maronite Diocese of Australia, located in Strathfield, received $5,000 of federal funding to run training courses for volunteers across various parishes. Similarly, St Vincent de Paul Society in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        has received $2,400 in federal funding to supply training to their volunteer counsellors so that they can assist those presenting with mental health conditions. The Vinnie's volunteers often reach out to those most vulnerable in our community through the Burwood community centre and the Vinnie's shops. The training will allow their incredible volunteers to identify concerns for safety for both themselves and their clients. Particularly during this period of coronavirus, our faith based organisations have stepped up their pastoral care and outreach programs to check on those who are most vulnerable in our community.
