        After the success of the Jobs and Skills Expo in Ipswich in 2010, which saw 3,200 local job seekers connect with hundreds of jobs and skills training opportunities, I lobbied hard to get another Jobs and Skills Expo in Ipswich. Since September 2009, the federal Labor government has held 52 expos and seen more than 19,700 Australians being connected with jobs. The jobs and skills expos form part of this government's $3 billion Building Australia's Future Workforce package to tackle unemployment and skills gaps in areas such as Ipswich and its surrounding region. Having a jobs and skills expo in Ipswich has provided real opportunities for local businesses, local government, TAFEs, universities, Defence Force and the like to look for staff. The skills expo has provided a great networking opportunity for business, government and individuals. Tony Perera, a manager from the Australian government

        in Ipswich, encouraged local job seekers to attend the expo as well. The expo was held on 13 June 2012, over 475 jobs were up for grabs and around 260 job seekers were connected with a job at the Australian Government Jobs and Skills Expo at the showgrounds in Ipswich on that day. About 2,400 people went through the gates and into the showgrounds and about 1,150 resumes were taken by over 80 exhibitors. It was a resounding success. There were about 1,000 people through the gate in the first hour. The Minister for Employment Participation, the Hon.
