        I was going to talk about how the government has delivered another mobile base station in the town of Waroona, but the member for Burt has raised the by-election of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Range" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which will be held this weekend. I need to put it on the record that this election is about trust. I remind the House that the former member for Darling Range Mr Barry Urban falsified his university degree, his war medals and his war service record. He was expelled from the state parliament, and that is why we are going to a by-election.

        An honourable member: And Labor put him up!
       </p>

        Labor put him up. He was endorsed by the state Labor Party, and then Colleen Yates was preselected by the Labor Party to replace Barry Urban. She falsified her

        as well and stepped down. We're now onto the third candidate for Labor. The people of Darling Range have a choice this Saturday. They have a choice between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Hayden" rel="nofollow">

        —who spent several years in the upper house in WA, has a proven track record, can be trusted and is the person she says she is—or they can go with another Labor candidate. I call on the people of Darling Range to back Alyssa Hayden this Saturday because they know that they can trust her.
