        and annual awards presentation to present the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Award. It's always good to go to the St George District Athletics Club AGMs. They're always very well organised and well attended, and this year was no exception. The outstanding sporting achievement awards recognise people in our community who go above and beyondâ€”who go the extra mile in pursuit of their chosen sport. This year I was able to present the award to Kai Hammond. Kai has had a huge number of achievements during the year, including competing at the

        On 22 June I attended the 50th anniversary celebration for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph's
        </a>
        Riverwood Sports Club. St Joseph's Riverwood Sports Club started out as part of St Joseph's school at Riverwood, but over the years it has expanded. It now has about 300 kids involved in the club, many of whom don't actually go to St Joseph's but who are still benefitting from this fantastic club. There are more than 30 teams in the club, in cricket, netball, T-ball, touch football and oztag. It's a club has a particularly strong sense of camaraderie amongst the parents. It's a very close-knit group, and it was good to chat with the parents on the night. I would like to acknowledge the club president Robert Keeling, vice-president Dean Tandek, secretary Brett Puckeridge and treasurer Ryan Cole for their many contributions to our local community. I'd also like to acknowledge Matt Carr, who was award a Banks Volunteer of the Year award this year for his fantastic contributions to the club.

        On 9 June I attended the Picnic Point Public School P&amp;C meeting. There's a very active P&amp;C at Picnic Point Public School. One of the very important issues there at the moment is the need for a pedestrian crossing on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Thomas Street
        </a>
        . There is no pedestrian crossing there, and there should be one. There was an accident recently on that street, and that has underscored the need for a pedestrian crossing to be put in place. I look forward to action being taken on that topic. Thank you to the P&amp;C for inviting me. I also want to thank principal Ben Walsh, P&amp;C president
