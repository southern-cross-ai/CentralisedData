        [by video link] Grace Tame was selected as Australian of the Year because of her bravery ingiving voice to victims of sexual assault. When Grace Tame speaks, it's important that we listen. Today, Ms Tame asked why the Prime Minister has decided to promote the member for Pearce to become Leader of the House despite the serious allegations made against him. It's a very good question, one the Prime Minister should answer.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's the Leader of the House's job to decide what this parliament debates. Serious allegations were made against the Leader of the House. The Prime Minister has consistently refused an independent inquiry. When he was the Attorney-General, the acting Leader of the House did nothing about a major report on sexual harassment other than allowing it to gather dust on his desk for more than a year. What are victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment supposed to make of the Prime Minister's decision to promote the member for Pearce now? Grace Tame has asked these important questions. It's up to the Prime Minister to answer them.
