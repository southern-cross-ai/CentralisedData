       <p>
        I'm absolutely outraged to see the Prime Minister and the Treasurer spruik their $1.6 billion underspend at the expense of people with disabilities in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . This is an absolute disgrace. It is not an achievement. It's $1.6 billion in services that are supposed to support people with disabilities. They're the people who will miss out because this government has botched the NDIS rollout at every single turn. Every single day I'm contacted by constituents who are being let down by this government and the NDIS. There are inexcusable wait times and inadequate care plans and there is a lack of choice, yet those in this government would rather parade around, patting themselves on the back about a $1.6 billion underspend that ought to be directed to the NDIS and those people with disabilities.

        I'll just give one example: a young constituent from my electorate, Edward, who was offered a care plan totalling approximately $33,000. This care plan was made completely administratively, without so much as a meeting with Edward or his family. How can you possibly be aware of the intricate needs of people you have never met? Edward's family undertook their own research and came back with a figure of $86,000—a shortfall of around $50,000 for this 12-month period. It is an utter disgrace, and I have written to the minister requesting an urgent review of Edward's case. It is a disgrace—
