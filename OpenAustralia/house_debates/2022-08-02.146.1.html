        I rise to speak about the importance of Vietnam Veterans' day and a coalition commitment that is close to my heart: a $5 million promise to build a veterans wellness centre in my electorate of Dawson and the adjoining electorate of Capricornia, held by my colleague Michelle Landry. Both electorates have a proud history of service. Vietnam

        These men showed grit and determination to stand by their mates and uphold the Anzac spirit. We continue this great tradition by standing by our mates today. That is why I'm using this occasion to call on the new government to honour our commitment to provide veterans wellness centres in the Mackay region. These centres will be used by veterans, Defence personnel and their families. They would also be available to first responders seeking some relief from the stressors of their work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Veteran wellbeing centres provide a one-stop shop to connect veterans and first responders with support and advocacy services. We would not have the way of life that we all take for granted today if not for the sacrifices of past and present members of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        and their families. This is an opportunity to show that Australia is a society that values the idea of mates standing up with their mates. We owe it to our veterans, our first responders and their families to build these centres. The $5 million commitment would go towards two centres in Mackay and a third at
