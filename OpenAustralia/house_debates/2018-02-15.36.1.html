       <p>
        Many of my constituents are very concerned about the proposal for a cable car on kunanyi/

        , and I share their concernsâ€”not least because I'm unconvinced that a cable car will stack up against strict social, environmental and economic criteria. But not only is the cable car proposal deeply flawed; the state government is being dishonest and tricky in the way they've tried to ram it through. Indeed, on Tuesday, we learned that the Minister for State Growth gave the green light for significant survey and construction work to begin on the mountain, just days before the state election was called. He quietly gave approval for these controversial works, didn't tell anybody and hoped like hell no-one would notice. When the Premier was asked about the issue on Tuesday he said he wasn't aware of the matter, which is patently ridiculous. Surely the Premier would know about such a significant and controversial decision. So he needs to come clean about what he knows and to tell the community as soon as possible. If he genuinely didn't know then it shows that his government it out of control. Not everyone shares my views on the cable car, and I respect that. But everyone should be concerned when politicians abandon proper process and keep Tasmanians in the dark.
