       <p>
        This week has been a watershed moment for the victims of the unlawful robodebt scandal. The Albanese government has agreed, in full or in principle, to all 56 recommendations of the royal commission into the coalition robodebt scandal.
       </p>
       <p>
        But today I particularly want to talk about the 30,000-or-so staff who work at Services Australia. Many were traumatised by having to follow and implement the morally bankrupt suggestions of their senior leadership and the previous coalition ministers. The Labor government says no more—never again—to robodebt. But what's important is that Services Australia staff feel that they are backed up on the front line, which they are by this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge two Services Australia officers who exemplify the typical frontline worker. The first is Sean Donohoe, a member of my community. In the last couple of weeks, Sean has retired after 31 years of service to people who used to come through the office of the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">
         DSS
        </a>
        in Glenroy and at Broadmeadows Centrelink. For the last 10 years, Sean's focus has been working with and helping refugees and asylum seekers. He played an important role in establishing the national Refugee Servicing Network team earlier this year. For Sean, this is not just a job but also a vocation, a deliberate decision to be a true servant of the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sean was and is a priceless asset. He generously mentored junior staff to ensure customers reaped the benefits of his experience and wisdom. What a great legacy, Sean; congratulations. I thank him for three decades of service, and I wish him and Natalie well in their next chapter.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge another senior Services Australia frontline leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Henderson" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Henderson
        </a>
        . Kim was the service centre manager at the Newmarket Service Centre for the best part of 21 years. She's worked at Medicare Services Australia, and she has built an exceptional team down there at Flemington near where I live and where my office is. She's been fantastic for my electorate office to deal with. I saw Kim in action last year at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maribyrnong_River" rel="nofollow">
         Maribyrnong River
        </a>
        floods. She and her Services Australia team worked tirelessly to help community members in their desperate need of support. Indeed, after the dreadful stabbing of respected team leader Joeanne Cassar at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_West" rel="nofollow">
         Airport West
        </a>
        earlier this year, Kim helped pull together the response, and helped a lot of shocked and traumatised staff regroup to continue their services to everyday Australians. I want to express my gratitude to Kim for all of the work she's done, and I look forward to her contribution at the National Disability Insurance Agency going forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary, Services Australia staff work not only with their intellect and physical labour but also with their emotions. This is a tiring and thankless task. A lot of vulnerable people, who are doing it hard, walk through the doors of Centrelink and Services Australia offices, and they take their cues from how these staff are feeling and how the staff are responding. It can be very tiring working with your emotional, physical and intellectual energy every day, but that's what Services Australia staff do. Today I've just given but two of the stories, of Sean Donohoe and Kim Henderson. I want to thank all of the frontline staff of Services Australia, because you do a fantastic job and you extend human rights to all Australians.
