       <p>
        This morning a number of members and senators attended a presentation by Osteoporosis Australia. I know that osteoporosis is of concern to a great many people within the electorate of Cowan. I would like to thank Professor Ego Seeman, Dr Kerin Fielding, Professor Peter Ebeling and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        of Osteoporosis Australia Naseema Sparks for the presentation this morning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Osteoporosis is a condition that affects a lot of people in Australia. It is a condition where the bones become fragile and brittle and fracture much more easily than normal bones. In Australia, half of all women and one-third of men over 60 will have a fracture due to osteoporosis. It has been estimated that this costs $1.9 billion a year in direct costs to this country. It is estimated that, for fractures that do not occur, there is a saving of between $16,000 and $17,000. So there is a lot at stake. In 2007 there were 21,000 hip fractures, and that certainly demonstrates the impact on this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just mentioned the proportion of people who suffer from the condition. It is estimated that 20 per cent of the population—2.2 million people—in this country have osteoporosis. Of those, half a million are men. A risk factor for this is family history. Obviously age is involved as well. There are also negative factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and a diet lacking in calcium. More people need to take responsibility for their own lifestyles. They need to improve calcium consumption—1,000 milligrams a day is recommended for all of us, and 1,300 milligrams for post menopausal women and men over 60.

        and load-bearing exercise will also help. There seems to be more work required with the professional culture to make sure scans are considered more often by

        s and other medical professionals. Bone density testing is also required. I am greatly concerned about osteoporosis. There is more that all of us could do as individuals. We need to keep a focus on osteoporosis in the future.
