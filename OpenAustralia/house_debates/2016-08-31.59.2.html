        What a spectacle we witnessed earlier today. The member for Dawson executed a backflip that would have been good enough to win gold at the Rio Olympics in recanting his support for a royal commission into the banks. Indeed, just four months ago on 9 April this year, the member for Dawson tweeted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        @SenatorWacka is right: we need a royal commission into the banks. Their treatment of farmers is appalling.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Facebook he went on to tell his supporters:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been a supporter of such a royal commission in the past and will continue to be stringent about the need for it in the next parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        He went on to ask his Facebook followers, 'Will
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        have the courage to propose a royal commission?'
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, today Bill Shorten had the courage to move that in this parliament, and what did the member for Dawson do? Jelly-backed

        on an issue of policy. Defending the banks was the first issue to spur the

        </a>
        to take on the extremists in his party, not the member for Dawson's attendance at a

         Reclaim Australia
        </a>
        rally, not his vilification of refugees but defending the banks. The embarrassment of this has caused the member for Dawson to block me on Twitter. I am sorry George; you cannot block me in parliament. The standing orders do not provide for it. I will not let you run away from this shameless backflip. I will remind you and I will remind your constituents that what you fought for at the last election, the big game you talked about on social media and what you told your constituentsâ€”the first vote you took in parliament, you wimped it.
