        Senior managers have given the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        legislation a thumbs down, according to a recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        survey. The survey of 300 business managers by a Gold Coast tourism organisation has revealed that a solid majority of them believe that Work Choices is bad for their businesses and their workforce. The survey found that only 17 per cent of respondents said Work Choices would be good for their organisation, 12 per cent said it would be good for them personally, 24 per cent said it would be good for skilled workers and 12 per cent said it would be good for less skilled workers. The survey results also showed that 88 per cent of respondents want four weeks leave each year to be guaranteed by law and not to be allowed to be cashed out, 73 per cent said penalty rates should apply for working overtime, 74 per cent said that penalty rates should apply for working on weekends or public holidays and 88 per cent said there should be protection against unfair dismissal.

        Despite the protestations of the government, there is no doubt that not only small businesses but many managers think that Work Choices is both unfair and prescriptive. The survey that has been conducted by a Gold Coast tourism organisation underlines the absolute assertion that Work Choices is bad for small business and for employees. I think the government has to start responding to this survey, talking to managers more often and outlining to managers why it is that Work Choices has been legislated by this government, because clearly it is unpopular and unfair.
