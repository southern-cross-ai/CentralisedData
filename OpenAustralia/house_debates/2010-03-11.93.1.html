       <p>
        I would like to take the time today to pay tribute to an organisation in Melbourne’s south-east that I have worked with in the past and whose director I had the opportunity to meet with again last month. Christians Helping in

        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS" rel="nofollow">
         CHIPS
        </a>
        for short, is but one of the iconic non-profit organisations in our region working tirelessly for young kids who have had a tough time.
       </p>
       <p>
        CHIPS has been operating for over 10 years now, which is testament to the work of Eric Wieckmann, often known as ‘Captain Eric’. Eric was awarded the Ministry to Children children’s worker of the year in 2000 and won Citizen of the Year for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Casey" rel="nofollow">
         City of Casey
        </a>
        in 2005. Eric has been working with kids for over 20 years and each year works with some 10,000 children in Australia and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my immediate region there are well over 60 schools, and CHIPS aims to help children in as many of these schools as possible. One of the most impressive things about Eric is that he is constantly trying to find new ways to help members of the community. He often speaks at school speech nights, leaders’ retreats and seminars.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an example, CHIPS’ response to the devastation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">
         Black Saturday
        </a>
        bushfires showed this organisation helps those in need. CHIPS staff and volunteers directly contributed by conducting survivors’ retreats, school seminars in Warragul and Drouin, financial assistance to Casey victims, camps for children and memorial services at Glen Crombie and Jindivick.
       </p>
       <p>
        On an ongoing basis, CHIPS provides seminars for students, teachers and parents; counselling and welfare services; camps and programs for children in crisis; and sailing programs for disadvantaged children in places like Lysterfield Lake. It organises a Christmas show that visits numerous schools and last year performed to over 3,000 students and, of course, runs other programs in schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no shortage of kids in need who CHIPS in fact help, whether this be in the form of taking kids on a sailing camp—an opportunity that they may have never experienced before—or just providing them with some much needed love and attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take the boy whose family forgot his birthday, so they threw him a party; or the girl who was suffering from depression or grief, so CHIPS waited through the pain with her till she felt some comfort; or even the young man who had his youth stolen from him, so CHIPS took him to a farm where he could let go of his inhibitions and play like any normal kid would. It is often the kids who have the toughest time in their lives who need looking out for, but the work that CHIPS does will help the ones who will help look out for each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Too often, the work of organisations like CHIPS goes unrecognised. Employees and volunteers like Captain Eric do not pursue a career with organisations like CHIPS because they are seeking the fame and glory for doing so. I reckon this place is a great forum for recognising the efforts of those making the community a better place to live in. Today, accordingly, I am pleased to mention the great work of Eric Wieckmann and CHIPS in this place.
