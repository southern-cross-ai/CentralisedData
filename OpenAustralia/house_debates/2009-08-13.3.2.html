        That, in accordance with section 5 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament Act
        </a>
        1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 11 August 2009, namely: Parliament Drive one-way road upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion is seeking approval of the parliament to upgrade the Parliament Drive one-way road. Parliament Drive was converted to a one-way road in late 2006. This was done to help improve the traffic efficiency of the road following security upgrades in the area. Since that time there have been a number of minor traffic incidents on the road, such as vehicles proceeding the wrong way along the one-way road. If left unaddressed, the current situation could result in a serious traffic accident.
       </p>
       <p>
        A traffic engineering report was commissioned by the Department of Parliamentary Services. This report recommended a number of modifications to significantly reduce the likelihood of traffic accidents occurring. The proposed project will implement these recommendations. The estimated construction cost for the upgrade is $1.4 million and construction works are planned to take place late in 2009. The costs and timings of the works will be confirmed after construction contracts have been received.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Presiding Officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precinct and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        is responsible for other works in the Parliamentary Zone. Accordingly, this motion is moved on behalf of the Speaker and the President in my capacity as Leader of the House, and I commend the motion to the House.

        Question agreed to.
