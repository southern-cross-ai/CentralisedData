        I rise to congratulate Gippsland business owners and community leaders on the formation of the Committee for Gippsland. The new committee was officially launched by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ryan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and has recently appointed a young lady from our region, Mary Aldred, as its chief executive. The committee is chaired by Harry Rijs from Patties Foods in Bairnsdale. The Rijs family have made a very long and extraordinary contribution to the Gippsland region and Harry is continuing that service in this role. Next week the members of the committee will be in Canberra and I am looking forward to meeting with them and helping to set priorities for Gippsland's future.

        Part of that future is our shared interest in providing opportunities for young people, like the students from the Lakes Entrance Primary School, who are in the gallery here today. It is great to see the Lakes Entrance Primary School students here with their teachers and I hope that members recognise that the Lakes Entrance Primary School is one of the finest primary schools in regional Australia. Of course, I am completely biased because my four children have all attended Lakes Entrance Primary School. It is wonderful to see the students here today and I am sure all members will join with me in welcoming them and thanking the Parliamentary Education Office for the work they do in helping our young people gain a better appreciation of our civic duties here in the parliament. I welcome Lakes Entrance Primary School students to the parliament. I hope they enjoy their time here in our nation's capital and travel safely back to the electorate by the end of the week.
