       <p>
        By indulgence—and I thank the House, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister and the opposition leader for their support in making this statement. I acknowledge, of course, the presence in the distinguished visitors' gallery today of the Mexican Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Armando Alvarez Reina, and his Deputy Head of Mission, Mr Victor Manuel Trevino Escudero.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 21 November 2015, the lives of two families changed in the most unimaginable way when Adam Coleman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Lucas" rel="nofollow">
         Dean Lucas
        </a>
        , both 33, were killed in Mexico. Adam along with his childhood friend Dean were murdered by robbers on a highway in Sinaloa. Their murders were brutal—a robbery that went wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        The section of the road where they died is notorious for crime, but it is a toll road and the men probably felt safe enough. They were fluent in Spanish and were experienced travellers who felt comfortable in almost any surroundings. Adam and Dean were killed by men posing as police officers. We can only imagine that the murderers were targeting Adam and Dean for bribery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Adam's and Dean's families became aware of their disappearance and, through the assistance of the boys' girlfriends, the car with the boys' remains was found. The families were informed of their death, and the circumstances, on 28 November 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        Support for the families by the Australian department of foreign affairs, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        , to Sinaloa in Mexico and continues to this day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The families would like to thank the Mexican government, who helped to resolve this dreadful crime and aided them in getting the men home.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mexican" rel="nofollow">

        government were very supportive and cooperative and never shied away from the horror. We understand that they are trying hard to make Mexico safe, and, although the families were gutted by this incident, they have enduring affection for Mexico and its people. Both families will visit Mexico in the future—as tourists, not as grieving parents. Their love for Mexico is undiminished.
       </p>
       <p>
        The families of Dean and Adam would like to thank the following people, whose sincere and professional manner and whose care and concern in all respects in their jobs is greatly appreciated. They asked me in particular to thank the Hon. Julie Bishop MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister, they have made clear, has extended both gracious care and concern and the great capacity of the department of foreign affairs to be supportive of this family. They thank the Hon. Michael Keenan MP, as Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism. The support of the Australian Federal Police has been simply outstanding at the most important time for this family and the consular services section of the

        </a>
        has been terrific.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank His Excellency David Engel, the Australian Ambassador to Mexico. I also thank the Governor, Mr Mario Lopez Valdez, and Attorney-General, Marco Antonio Higuera Gomez, of the state of Sinaloa, for their support for the families of Dean and Adam. I thank Mayor Miguel Enriquez for the generosity and help the city of Navolato provided to families. I thank Mr John Borghetti and Virgin airlines, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS" rel="nofollow">
         GS
        </a>
        Holdings in Edmonton, Canada, the generous employer of Dean and Adam, for their understanding and help. On behalf of the grieving families, I thank you all.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important for me to emphasise that the advice of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        Smartraveller is to get travel insurance, organise your passport and visas, and register your travel plans on the Smartraveller website for up-to-date information wherever you are travelling. This service helps all families in times of need. Travellers are of course responsible for themselves and their safety. That makes even more special the generous and loving sentiments Dean and Adams' families have for Mexico. In a happier time, Dean and Adam's families will return to explore beautiful Mexico—a wonderful country. The families will eat amazing food, surf incredible waves and, most of all, thank some special friends for helping them through a difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the families, I thank the House for its indulgence. I thank Minister Bishop, Minister Keenan, the Prime Minister, the opposition leader and you, Mr Speaker. Every hour of every day around the world, a national interest is served by the wonderful men and women of our Public Service, working, as I have described here today, to help our families in times of need. On behalf of the families of Dean and Adam, I thank them all and I thank you all for your indulgence.

         Minister Keenan and I thank the member for Brand for his gracious statement. We fully endorse the sentiments that he expressed here in the House today. I add our condolences, my own personal condolences, those of Minister Keenan and those of the government, to the families and loved ones of these two young

         ns who were murdered in such tragic circumstances. I monitored the case closely. I was shocked by its brutality. I acknowledge the extraordinary grace with which the family and the loved ones have responded to this most harrowing event.
        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of the Australian government, I thank the Mexican government for its efficient handling of the case. I acknowledge the presence in the House of the ambassador and the deputy head of mission from Mexico. I thank the member for Brand for acknowledging the work of the

         consular staff. I pay tribute to them for their tireless work. Our consular staff operate in often very difficult and dangerous circumstances and yet they are always prepared to support Australians who find themselves in difficulties overseas and their families back home. So I thank the consular staff in Canberra and also in our embassies around the world who were involved in this most tragic of cases. I thank the House.
