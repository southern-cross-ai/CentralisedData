        I was delighted to join the Lives Lived Well team at the end of last month for the opening of their brand new office in the heart of the Forde electorate, in Beenleigh. Lives Lived Well provides support for people in Queensland communities who are impacted by alcohol or drugs and are experiencing problems with their mental health. Their aim is to take a holistic, compassionate and harm minimisation approach to help people live their lives well.

        It was only a few years ago, in 2017, when I first joined the Lives Lived Well team to open their first office in Beenleigh. Over the past five years, they've provided individual alcohol and other drug counselling and support services to over 1,200 people in my community. They have identified a need in the community for this service and have specifically designed their programs to meet the diverse needs of our community, including working with young people, children, Aboriginal and

        people and their communities. Lives Lived Well have a firm belief that with the right support people can truly change their lives for the better. It is this belief that we all should be inspired to take when working with our community. I commend the work of Lives Lived Well and the revolutionary approach they are taking in this space. I look forward to working alongside and supporting Lives Lived Well well into the future.
