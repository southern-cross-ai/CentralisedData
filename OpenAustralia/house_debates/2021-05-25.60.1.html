        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is continuing to boost job opportunities for women across the country, including through the Women's Leadership and

         I thank the member for Bass for her question. As a mother, a farmer, a mayor, her diverse lived experience makes her an ideal representative for her community, and she knows that women are helping the Australian economy come back like never before. The Morrison government is determined to help women every step of the way. As part of our 2020 Women's Economic Security Statement, we significantly expanded the Women's Leadership and

         . In the member's hometown of Launceston, Brave Foundation is one of 60 organisations around the country receiving grants amounting to nearly $40 million as part of this program. Of that, the Brave Foundation will receive $6 million. This grant will help support the wonderful work of Brave. They help young mothers—and, in some cases, young fathers—navigate their way through school during pregnancy and after the birth of their child, and navigate their way onto pathways after school: getting a job, getting a drivers licence and building financial literacy. This is all vital to ensuring that women in all different walks of life can fulfil their potential, be the best they can be in whatever they endeavour to do, while also being incredible young mothers. As a result of this funding, Bernadette Black and the team at Brave can now increase their work to support 1,000 women. The member for Bass is a champion for organisations like Brave.

         Of course, it's not just in Tasmania that we're backing Australian women; it's right across the country. I know the member for Lindsay is a strong supporter of Western Sydney Women, an organisation that promotes

         career participation by women of all ages. Women have also received funding just across the river from my own electorate. We're supporting a Wangaratta organisation, The Skill Engineer, to help encourage women into apprenticeships and trades such as boilermaking and welding, through education, work experience and work trial opportunities. And I know the member for Durack greatly welcomes the support we're giving to a project focusing on improving the leadership capabilities and financial security of Martu women in remote communities in

         . We are committed to empowering women all across the country, not just for the benefit of the individual but because we know that a stronger, more empowered Australia is a result.
