        It is with great sadness that I am again using the opportunity of a member's statement to pay tribute to a much loved and tireless member of the

        Labor Party lost too soon. Brendon Morrison, a life member of ACT Labor Party, passed away last week at the age of 59. Brendon was a member of the Labor Party for 20 years. He was an active member of the Weston Creek Sub-branch and was also actively involved with the

        and the plumbers' unions in the ACT and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Brendon was an incredibly generous and community minded person; a supporter of many Canberra charities. A double amputee, he was also a living example of the fact that having a disability need not be a hindrance to community involvement. Brendon always showed great support for many Labor candidates in the ACT and New South Wales. I was lucky enough to experience this support firsthand, and I will never forget the friendship and generosity of time and spirit Brendon showed to me and my team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brendon was a regular volunteer in my electorate office, especially in the months leading up to last year's election. He was in the office every day, even on weekends, doing whatever needed to be done; sharing his years of experience and wisdom; supporting my staff and other volunteers; and, above all, sharing a good joke. We will miss his presence, his sense of humour, his unwavering support and his friendship.
       </p>
       <p>
        My deepest condolences to his wife, Di, and family and friends. Rest in peace, Brendo. We will miss you terribly.
