        This motion invites the Rt Hon. John Key, Prime Minister of New Zealand, to address a meeting of the House on Monday, 20 June 2011. The House will sit with the ringing of the bells with proceedings to commence at approximately 2.30 pm. Following welcoming remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Key will address the parliament. As with the address by the President of Indonesia in March last year, senators will be invited to attend and there will be similar parliamentary arrangements in place including no question time in the House that day. The House will then suspend until the ringing of the bells which we anticipate will be between 4 pm and 5 pm, depending upon the official arrangements with Prime Minister Key.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Key will be engaged in a number of meetings in the morning with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and with senior ministers. There will also be a formal ceremonial welcome in the forecourt of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . For the information of members there will be a formal luncheon in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        from 12.50 pm on Monday to which, of course, all members and senators will be invited.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Key will become the first

         Australian Prime Minister
        </a>
        to address the New Zealand parliament earlier this year. Australia's relations with New Zealand are the closest and most comprehensive we have with any country. The relationship is built on a firm foundation of strong government, business and people-to-people links and shared values and history. Prime Minister Key's visit will provide an opportunity to further strengthen and energise the trans-Tasman relationship. I indicate to the House, Mr Speaker, that we consulted with the opposition about these arrangements, and I thank the opposition for their support.
