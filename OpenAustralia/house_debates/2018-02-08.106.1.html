        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. Will the government ensure that, on the day of its opening, rail access will be available at

         I do thank the member for Werriwa for her question, and I'd like to thank her for her work on the Forum on

         Airport, which is the community consultation mechanism we have underway to make sure there is good community engagement in relation to Western Sydney Airport, a project which, to get underway, took a coalition government—a project which had been in the too-hard basket for 20, 30, 40 years. It took a coalition government to take a decision to proceed with Western Sydney Airport, and we have made the commitment to invest $5.3 billion of taxpayers' funds to get this airport built and delivered by the end of 2026. Already there is work underway on the site, with a high-voltage transmission line being undergrounded. That is a project of nearly $100 million. Already we have the head office of the company open and operational in Liverpool, in the member's electorate of Werriwa.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we have a $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, involving the provision of excellent ground transport connectivity to Western Sydney Airport, including a new M12 that will run from the airport to the M7 and connect into the Sydney motorway network. The Northern Road will be upgraded to at least four lanes for all of its 35-kilometre length. At the same time, the two governments—the Commonwealth government and the

         government—have work well advanced on a scoping study to look at the rail needs of Western Sydney and Western Sydney Airport. That has reported to the two governments, and we'll have more to say in the coming months. The airport site, of course, is planning to be rail ready, and that work is well underway. The Turnbull government is getting on with—

           Yes, Mr Speaker. It was a very precise, tight question. It asked: will the rail line be open when the airport is open?

            The member for Grayndler can resume his seat. He doesn't need to disclose to me he was the author of it. That's not necessary at all. The minister is being directly relevant to the question.

             governments is well advanced in relation to a Western Sydney city deal. We have an overall, comprehensive policy approach to delivering infrastructure for Western Sydney, as we are doing around the country. The Turnbull government are delivering infrastructure for Western Sydney. We've got a track record that we're proud of, and there's a lot more going on.
