        My question is to the Minister for Industry and Science. How is the Albanese Labor government delivering for Australian manufacturers? Has there been any opposition to these initiatives?

         Thanks to the member for Parramatta for the question, and also thank you for taking me to see Helios Power in Rydalmere. Helios is a great electronics manufacturer doing some good work in defence and transport. It was also good, last week, to see a number of Australian manufacturers doing really well, be it Noumi foods in the member for Macarthur's electorate; Recharge Industries with the ambition to manufacture Australian-made batteries in Geelong, which the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for Corangamite are very happy to see; and also in Moreton, where Orrcon Steel is helping us manufacture products that will be important for the transition to a clean energy future. The common thread here being that Australian manufacturers with the confidence to do more onshore create great jobs for fellow Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Twelve months ago, the Albanese government were elected on a commitment to build a future made in Australia. In that time, we've secured support for the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. In the last budget, just a few weeks ago, the Industry Growth Program was funded to help build small and medium businesses, provide them with the support to grow. We also had support for the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre, plus the development of a National Battery Strategy, to manufacture more renewable technology here in Australiaâ€”all delivering for manufacturers today and tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, it would be a different story for manufacturing in Australia if the election had turned out differently. The coalition basically spent a decade daring manufacturers to leave, reducing support for manufacturing so that manufacturing self-sufficiency tanked. The coalition have gotten worse in opposition: pretending to care, never delivering. You cannot pretend to support manufacturing and then vote against the greatest investment in manufacturing capability in living memory in the National Reconstruction Fund. You can't pretend to be concerned about the impact of higher energy prices on manufacturers and then vote against the energy price relief that delivers them support. Those opposite are all addicted to pretending. They haven't learned a thing! They all got this from the member of Cook. Remember the member for Cook? He pretended to be a welder, he pretended a carpenter, he pretended to be a truck driver, he pretended to be half the cabinet! They cannot just continually pretend to care and also not be there. They can't be all talk, no walk. Australian manufacturers deserve better.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, we've done a lot of work in the last 12 months, and we know we've got more to do. We will not slow down in our commitment to deliver a future made in Australia, and it's time those opposite actually did the same.
