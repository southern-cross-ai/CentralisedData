       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to make some brief remarks about item 16 of the list of documents to be tabled, the
        <i>
         International piracy and armed robbery at sea security inquiry report
        </i>
        . I made a statement to the House in June 2009 to advise members that I asked the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, to undertake a comprehensive inquiry into maritime piracy and armed robbery at sea as it affects Australia and to identify ways in which security arrangements could be further improved. The inspector has completed his report, which he formally presented to me on 22 April 2010. During the course of the inquiry the inspector developed counterpiracy and armed robbery at sea security advisory guidelines for the Australian shipping industry which I launched at the International Maritime Organisation General Assembly in London in December 2009. The guidelines detail preventative measures recommended to help detect, deter and prevent piracy and armed robbery at sea.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final report contains five recommendations. The first recommendation is that the preventative measures contained in the advisory guidelines should be considered for adoption by ship operators, masters and owners. The second recommendation is that Australian security regulated ships undertaking international voyages as part of normal business activity should re-evaluate current security plans. The third recommendation is that consideration should be given to identifying a federal government agency to be the single or primary coordination point between the shipping industry and government on piracy. The fourth recommendation is that the government work with the shipping industry and maritime unions to facilitate a review of current seafarer welfare support practices and arrangements. The final recommendation is that current ship security planning arrangements should be reviewed to ensure that both safety and security issues are jointly applied to the security planning process. The continuing threat of piracy and armed robbery at sea will require shipping owners and operators to maintain a constant level of preparedness and awareness of the threat posed to them and to consistently update their knowledge of appropriate preventative measures and industry best practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        The piracy inquiry report will assist industry in this process and I congratulate the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, and his team for the hard work they have done on this report, which has been internationally recognised as being groundbreaking in its depth, in its research and in its recommendations. Indeed, members of Mr Palmer’s team travelled to Nairobi in Kenya and have provided practical on-the-ground assistance, which I am sure every member of this parliament would agree has given great credit to us as a nation. I commend the report to the House.

        Question agreed to.
