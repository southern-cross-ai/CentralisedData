        My question is to the Treasurer. Why is it important to recognise Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>

         I acknowledge the dedication that the member for Robertson brings to this place, and I thank him for the question. I also want to acknowledge, as the

         As you know, in 30 days time Australians will have a generational opportunity to listen better and to get better outcomes for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         people. When you strip away all of the conspiracy theories and all the mistruths and you look through the fog of misinformation and manipulation, this opportunity is really clear and really important to our country and to all of its people. I know that over the next 30 days there will be a number of Australians who will make up their mind—and they might not have decided yet—and I say to them: this is our chance to do things differently and to do things better, and that's what this Voice is all about at its core. We need to turn all of the goodwill and all of the taxpayer investment into better results and more progress because the status quo isn't working as well as it needs to. As Minister Burney has said, we need to go beyond making policy for First Nations people and make policy with them instead. We need to bring together our people, our principles and our pragmatism, and do something that we can be proud of. It will cost us nothing, but it will gain so much not only for the first of us but also for all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about what approaches we've rejected. We reject the bizarre policy of the opposition leader, who wants to have two referendums here, not one. The Leader of the Opposition wants two referendums because he wants to drag this out. He sees this not as an opportunity for unity but as an excuse for division. He wants Australians stuck in a cul-de-sac of confusion and conflict. That's what's going on here. He wants to leave this to our kids and their kids to sort out at some point down the track. We don't need two referendums. We can get this done in one. We can move forward together. We can listen better and we can get better outcomes for our people. We can rise above the nasty and negative and angry and divisive and dishonest politics that we've seen from those opposite and we can make history together. In 30 days time, we have a chance to grasp this generous and gracious invitation to walk together. This is our big chance as a country, and we cannot afford to waste it.
