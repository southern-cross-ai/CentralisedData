        Following the government's launch of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, which is a blueprint for a more entrepreneurial Australia, I held an innovators forum. At that forum, our first 'baker's dozen' of local innovators networked with export advisers, regional development advisers and business growth mentors. It was a perfect mix of fantastic ideas, information on developmental potholes and requests for further workshops on patent registration, funding and export readiness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our local innovators will help transform Australia into a leading innovation nation and position us to seize the next wave of economic prosperity. I believe each of us realises that we are living in a time of rapid change. Technology and science are evolving faster than ever, and the internet is disrupting traditional jobs and industries. The coalition government is fostering innovation by introducing $1.1 billion over four years to energise Australia into being an innovation pacesetter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians have no shortage of smart ideas. You only have to look at great discoveries and inventions like Wi-Fi, the Cochlear implant and the vaccine for ovarian cancer. But Australians who want to turn their brilliant ideas into great businesses can find it hard to get the money to start, and often have to go offshore. We are aligning our tax system and business laws with the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation that we are seeking to create. We are providing new tax incentives to remove the bias against businesses that innovate, and co-investing to commercialise promising ideas, through a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        Innovation Fund and a new Biomedical Translation Fund. Australians are naturally creative and enterprising, but we have a poor record of turning our best ideas into commercial realities. Often, there are barriers too hard for these individuals to overcome, so clever ideas are so often blocked by bureaucracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ideas boom will be fuelled by universities, start-up industries and agriculture, embracing risk and working together like never before. We are reforming funding incentives so more university funding is directed to research done in partnership with industry, providing funding certainty for world-leading research infrastructure, and investing in the future of

        The inaugural Gilmore innovators forum featured the talents of Dr Pia Winberg, Director and

She is the driving force behind the pioneering development and production of Australia's unique seaweed biomass and extracts industry.

       <p>
        Also present were Paul Timbs from South Coast Dairy, a premium and boutique dairy industry, and other dairy industry representatives who are developing their products and strategies to capitalise on the three free trade agreements. They employ a large number of people. We are hoping to get more dairy into China, Japan and Korea.

        Then we heard from Laurie Koster from Global Defence Solutions, a company at the forefront of nanotechnology applications, creating a technology for an ultra-thin layer to prevent moisture from being drawn into devices like smartphones and tablets.

        for their expertise and help in drawing other government services to the notice of our innovators. Gilmore is seriously blessed with innovators and entrepreneurs and I will be encouraging more attendees at future forums to turn this potential innovator energy to kinetic innovation growth, industry and ultimately jobs.
