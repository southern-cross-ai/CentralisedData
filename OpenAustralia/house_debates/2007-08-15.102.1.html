       <p>
        I thank my colleagues and the government for their cooperation in allowing me to briefly use this time to table a petition which, through inadvertence, was deemed not to be in order but is now in order. I table the petition from 270 constituents in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition of young citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the many pressing environmental issues likely to face young people, in particular, climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As young Australians we say that climate change is no longer an issue for tomorrow, it is an issue for today. It is time to transform understanding into action. We have a right, along with all species, to a sustainable future and a liveable planet. This right carries on to our children and grandchildren. Climate change affects all aspects of our lives. It impacts on our cultural heritage, including that of the oldest continuous culture on earth. It destroys a fragile environment unique in the world. Weather unpredictability, drought, increasing salinity, coral bleaching, sea level rise, habitat destruction and biodiversity loss threaten our country’s future —and with it, our own.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The unprecedented pace and intensity of climate change becomes more pronounced every year. We recognise that the current extent of climate change is human induced. We no longer have the luxury of continued debate; the time for action is now. As young Australians we are ready to make this change. We call upon all Australians to join us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This problem is global in dimension and personal in scope: each of us can make change now, and it is our responsibility to respond before it is too late. We see climate change as a threat but also an opportunity to build a more ecologically and socially responsible society.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Climate change poses a disproportionate impact on our Pacific neighbours, less developed nations, and marginalised peoples worldwide. Australia has an obligation to assist these vulnerable communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        as the original inhabitants and continuing custodians of this land and their unique position and valuable knowledge in caring for their country. We are concerned that climate change threatens Indigenous land and Indigenous peoples’ ability to maintain culture. Any climate change debate must include Indigenous perspectives so that land management and environmental practice is respectful of Indigenous culture, heritage and sacred sites.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Economic sustainability and livelihoods depend on our natural environment. We believe the cost of goods and services should reflect their true environmental and social cost, and government subsidies should be directed towards renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Australia’s economic interest lies upon realising the potential of sustainable innovation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The solutions to climate change already exist in Australia. We do not need nuclear power; it is too unsafe, too dirty, and too expensive. Similarly, we believe the idea of ‘clean coal’ is a distraction postponing a just transition from fossil fuels to a real clean energy future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Your petitioners therefore request that the House to commit to:
