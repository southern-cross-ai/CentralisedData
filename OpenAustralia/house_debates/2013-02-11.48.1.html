        Over the weekend Canberra staged the

         National Multicultural Festival
        </a>
        . The

        , officially launched the 2013 extravaganza which saw over 250,000 people gathered in Canberra's civic area and more than 400 stalls.

        Having attended the festival in the past I can honestly say this year was the biggest and best ever—it was huge. For the three days of the festival there was more food, more dancing, more drink and more music than ever before. I had the chance to serve dosas with my friends from the Indian community—and if you have not tried a dosa then you obviously should experience it because it is one of the wonders of the cuisine. A major feature of the festival was the India in the City celebration. I managed to get away with a few words in my passible Hindi and I do not think I embarrassed myself too much. Special acknowledgement goes to Deepak Raj Gupta for all his hard work. Another prominent spectacular was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        celebrations for the incoming

        </a>
        . I would like to acknowledge the outstanding services of Sam and Chin Wong for their contribution and that of the Chinese community. It was a sight to behold—glitter was showered over all of us to honour the new year. Sunday was topped off by the Greek Glendi, which gave us all an indulgence in Greek food and culture, and thanks to Paul Levantis for his involvement in that. Congratulations to Minister Burch—the festival was a true celebration of Canberra's diversity and its harmony.
