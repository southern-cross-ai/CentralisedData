       <p>
        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the opposition defence spokesperson be admonished for calling into question the integrity of Lieutenant General Angus Campbell.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think everyone in this place would be well aware that I have not been slow to criticise this government and previous governments when it has come to the decisions they have made about the use of the Defence Force. I of course was especially outspoken about the decision during the Howard government to join in the invasion of Iraq, for what I thought were fraudulent reasons. I was very critical of the decision more recently to keep our troops in Afghanistan much longer than they should have been there, and my outspoken criticism of the current government's abhorrent response to asylum seekers I think is well known. When it comes to asylum seekers, I think we should be acting like a rich and civilised country and as a signatory to the refugee convention. We should be taking people in, giving them protection, hearing their claims and giving them refuge if their claims are found to be accurate. Those whose claims are found not to be accurate should be sent back from where they came.
       </p>
       <p>
        But in all of these instances I have been very careful not to criticise the men and women of our security services and in particular of the Defence Force and of the intelligence services. I think a line was crossed yesterday when the opposition defence spokesperson called into question the integrity of General Campbell. General Campbell is a classmate of mine and someone I know a little, and I know that he is a good person and I know that he will do a good job following the orders he is given by the government of the day, as unpalatable as those orders are. I want to make this absolutely clear: I am in no way speaking in support of the government's abhorrent response to asylum seekers. I am criticising, though, the shadow defence spokesperson, who went too far yesterday by calling into question the character of one of Australia's most senior military officers. He has been given shocking orders to carry out, but I am sure that he is carrying them out to the best of his ability and he is doing it as honestly as he can. So I call on everyone in this place to support this motion: that the opposition defence spokesperson be admonished for calling into question the integrity of Lieutenant General Angus Campbell.

        <p>
         I second the motion. I support the motion moved by the member for Denison because what occurred yesterday in the Senate estimates hearing was a reflection not only on the Senate but on this entire parliament. That a person who occupies the position of shadow minister for defence could use the opportunity to launch a personal attack against one of Australia's finest military commanders is nothing short of a disgrace. What we wanted to hear, from last night and this morning and throughout question time, was something from the Leader of the Opposition to show that he did not agree with the outrageous, appalling, despicable conduct of the man he appointed as shadow minister for defence. What we wanted from the Leader of the Opposition was for him to say that Labor distanced themselves from this disgraceful act of attacking a military commander who had been asked by the Australian government to return to the service of this country by heading up Operation Sovereign Borders.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Denison can disagree with the policy, as he just has. The member for Denison can move motions in the House about it. We can debate it. What the member for Denison has done is the decent thing, by standing here and demanding that the opposition and other members of this House stand in condemnation of Senator Conroy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Look at this cabal going on here! They are so disorganised that they cannot even find a line to run in question time!

The Leader of the Opposition should have come out last night and condemned Senator Conroy for his disgraceful act.

               So he is taking former Senator Feeney's advice. It is about time, Leader of the Opposition. Take some advice from somebody who actually has worked with our defence forces and understands what this is doing to the morale of the men and women who serve this country. They do not expect to turn up in Senate estimates and have abuse hurled at them by the factional bovver boy of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition unleashed the bovver boy. It is time he put him back on the rein. It is time the Leader of the Opposition showed some courage, some decency, and demanded that Senator Conroy give an unqualified apology to an honourable man who has served this country for over 30 years.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a difficult task for any officer. This is a difficult task for any public servant. Lieutenant General Campbell was chosen because of his professionalism, his skill and his objectivity and he has risen to the task asked of him. He has to protect his Navy personnel because it is dangerous work in dangerous and risky circumstances. He has to withstand the glare of the media, who are focusing on Operation Sovereign Borders, but make no mistake: Operation Sovereign Borders was endorsed by the Australian people at the last election. So he is carrying out the tasks required of him by the government of the day. That is what our military personnel do, time in, time out. They do military work, they do humanitarian work, they carry out the policies, the requests and the directions of the government of the day. That is what they did when Labor were in government.
              </p>
              <p>
               What has happened to the Labor Party, who said there was bipartisan support for our military? What has happened to the Leader of the Opposition, who said he did not want our Navy to be a political football? What has happened to the decency that should be within this party? Enough of them have been defence ministers. Enough of them have been assistant defence ministers. There are decent people within the Labor Party, but they are not the Leader of the Opposition. It is now 10 past three on the day after this appalling attack, since this despicable slur was directed at Lieutenant General Campbell, and we still have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition.
              </p>
              <p>
               Does it really take a motion from one of the Independents for the Leader of the Opposition to get on his feet? Is that what it is going to take? He had opportunity after opportunity in question time. He could have stood up on indulgence and, Madam Speaker, we would have given the Leader of the Opposition an indulgence, had he asked you, so that he could have disassociated himself from the appalling conduct of Senator Conroy and joined with the government in condemning an attack on our military commanders.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lieutenant General Campbell deserves far better than this. He deserves our respect. He deserves our admiration. The Australian public have given him that respect and that admiration through the awarding of the Order of Australia for the work he did in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                East Timor
               </a>
               . They have recognised his distinguished service as he headed up all Australian troops in the

                  An attack, a slur. Senator Conroy accused General Campbell of personally being involved in a political cover-up. It was a personal attack. It was unwarranted. It was indecent and deliberately designed to dishonour the reputation of an honourable man. The Labor members should hang their heads in shame for allowing the bovver boy from Victoria to get away with yet another attack.

                    Our Minister for Communications indicated that Senator Conroy was obviously on some unspeakable rant yesterday. Not only did he attack the reputation of one of Australia's leading businessmen under parliamentary privilege but also then he attacked one of our most distinguished, one of our finest military commanders, a man who has put his life on the line for this country. The Leader of the Opposition is madly writing notes now. Leader of the Opposition, it is too late. You should have demanded an unqualified apology this morning. You should have stood up in question time and distanced yourself from Senator Conroy and having unleashed this dog of war, it is time you put him back on the leash.

                                 What a disorderly rabble this government are. We recognise on this side of the House that General Campbell and indeed everyone who serves in our armed forces, be it in Australia or overseas, is deserved of respect from the political process. On any number of occasions, as we have been discussing in public the policy issues around Operation Sovereign Borders, I have clearly stated that I do not regard our military as deserved of being the whipping boys or girls when there are legitimate concerns with government policy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Although it is very rare, I agree with part of what the Assistant Minister for Defence said. When he said that if the opposition have problems with what is happening with government policy, raise it about the government and do not attack the military. I have seen through my working life that when there are complex political issues, it is most easy for the blame-game to rain down from the top to the bottom. I do not support hiding behind the military when there are problems with government policy. I accept that those opposite think that their policy is great and I accept that we on this side believe that the addiction to secrecy is wrong. I do not accept as appropriate the use of the military by the government to hide their own lack of willingness to talk about what is really going on and to not be straight with the Australian people.
                                </p>

                                 The flavour of the debate from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that somehow the opposition do not support our military is wrong. It is a grievous mistruth. That is why this morning, when I was asked questions about the debate in the estimates committee last night, I made it very clear that Senator Conroy had withdrawn his remarks. People said, 'What does that mean?' and 'What do you think?' The fact that Senator Conroy made the comments and then withdrew them, I believe, speaks for itself. There is a recognition in this debate, if anyone bothers to read the whole transcript, that Senator Conroy is most concerned about the way the government is handling issues of secrecy around Operation Sovereign Borders. We see the government feign patriotism and wrap the flag around themselves and say, 'We're true patriots and anyone who criticises the government is in fact criticising the military and that makes them unpatriotic or unAustralian.' We are not falling for that lie. They say that patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels and we are seeing that truism yet again with this government.

                                 I respect our military and, like many here, I have had family members serve in the military. I understand the ultimate sacrifice that 40 of ours have made in Afghanistan. I understand that 200—

                                 Minister for Foreign Affairs! I am talking about the sacrifice of our soldiers. You could at least listen to that with respect. I understand—look at the government frown, as if they have a monopoly on patriotism. Forty people have died in Afghanistan. I know this and I know everyone on the other side knows this too, actually. I know that all of us in this House respect the 260 people who have come back with injuries and I know all of us in this House respect that there are many more people who will no doubt be dealing with the consequences and the psychological trauma of war for the rest of their lives.

                                 What Labor will not allow in this debate is false, faux patriotism—that when the opposition pursue the government on its policies somehow it is a reflection of Labor's commitment to our armed forces.

                                 And, yes, I was quoted correctly on 23 January when we heard reports about the alleged events involving Navy personnel on the high seas. I set my line in the sand early as opposition leader. I do not have a default button which says that when there are problems blame the military because I do not think that. I resent very much the cowardly insinuations of some of those false, flag-waving patriots who say that we on this side do not care as much about the military. That is why, at the start of my address to this House, I made it very clear what I think about General Campbell. That is why, before this afternoon, I have already made efforts to be in contact with him to indicate on behalf of Labor our ongoing respect and support for him because, you know what, I think that is the right thing to do.

                                 When we see the sanctimonious, finger-wagging, lecture-giving, sermonising, false patriotism from those opposite, when they seek to use the military as a stick to beat Labor about the head and when I hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs say that people deserve better, I say that General Campbell deserves better than being used as a political football to pursue your grubby culture of secrecy. Our military deserve better than you hiding behind uniforms. The minister ought to do his day job and tell us what is going on.

                                 The military deserve better than what the government did on the Saturday morning after what they said on Tuesday—implying blame on Reza Berati, that he was outside the wire and somehow had to take his own chances, and if he had stayed inside the wire he would have been safe. Then on the Saturday morning, we find out, or at least the government find out, that maybe what they said definitively was wrong. Then they waited until past the six o'clock news on Saturday to come out with the facts of the matter. When we want to give a lecture about morality, you do not live in a glass house, members of the government.

                                 What I also know is that in 2007, when Chief of Army General Gillespie was at estimates, it was Senator Ronaldson who called him a coward. I am sure given his time again that Senator Ronaldson might have chosen his words differently. But what we never do in this place is seek to use debate in estimates to somehow make a lie of the Labor Party's support for the men and women in our military. You know what? You can fight the next election and you can try your best to attack us with your policies, but do not ever try—

                                   I am pleased that you restated the motion, Madam Speaker, because the motion is, as you say, moved by the member for Denison, not a government member, and it is seconded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The motion is quite specific, and I believe the member for Denison has sought to be very specific in putting forward this motion so there is no confusion about any broader claim being made. I acknowledge that the member for Denison and I may have some differences on matters of policy which General Campbell is responsible for implementing, but the member for Denison has been specific in crafting this motion. The motion is that the opposition defence spokesperson, not the opposition as a whole, be admonished for something quite specific: calling into question the integrity of Lieutenant General Angus Campbell. That is the motion we are debating.

                                   Let us go to the conduct of Senator Conroy yesterday that the member for Denison is referring to. In Senate estimates he said this, very specifically, in questioning General Campbell:
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="italic">

                                   specifically General Campbell—
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="italic">
                                   are engaged in a political cover-up.

                                   That is what Senator Conroy said yesterday, and it is an outrageous sledge against someone of General Campbell's standing. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition is at least prepared to acknowledge that some of what has been said about Lieutenant General Campbell is true. I acknowledge all of it as true, as I am sure every member of this House would want to do and I am certain that every member on this side of the House does.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   It is a very specific motion. I am disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition has said that the opposition will not be supporting the motion. In so doing, he has confirmed and affirmed the behaviour of Senator Conroy in the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition in his response to this motion today has demonstrated how small a man he is when the challenge is put to him. The good-faith motion put forward by the member for Denison is to bring this House together and to ensure that the outrageous conduct of a member of the other place is brought under scrutiny. An opportunity has once again been given to the Leader of the Opposition to try and set this right. That is something the member for Chifley did last night, I acknowledge, but his leader is not prepared to do in this place today. That is a very small act from the Leader of the Opposition, who has proved in this place his smallness when dealing with a matter of such significance.

If a general of his standing says he has taken offence then Senator Conroy should not just have withdrawn. Everyone in this place knows that a withdrawal is not an apology. Senator Conroy should have apologised but he has not apologised. For that act, the member for Denison is right. The opposition defence spokesperson should be admonished by this House. He should have been admonished by the Leader of the Opposition. That should have happened last night; it should not have been dragged on.

                                         I note the interjections opposite. What we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition is a dance. He is dancing around it. He will not face up to the behaviour of his own shadow minister for defence. As the Assistant Minister for Defence said earlier, he opened his account as the shadow minister for defence with a sledge against one of our strongest and most able and most distinguished serving officers in our military.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Other matters have been raised in this debate by the Leader of the Opposition. I want to correct the record for their benefit, because they seem to not understand how Operation Sovereign Borders operates and how it works. It brings together 15 agencies which the commander of the Joint Agency Task Force operates on a daily basis. They have a single-minded task, and that is to stop the boats—and they are stopping the boats. Those policies are working. General Campbell's leadership is proving to be a key ingredient in that success. It only makes me wonder: why didn't the previous government ask someone like General Campbell to go and fix their mess? That is what this government did. This government put someone in who had the ability to take the policies of this government and implement them and get the results the Australian people were crying out for, because after almost 1,200 deaths it demanded the sort of action and the sort of leadership for the policies and their implementation that General Campbell is putting in place.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         I note particularly that the opposition takes issue with the policy regarding information and the handling of sensitive information in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders. I said before the last election that we would leave that matter of how information on matters of operations was to be addressed in the public domain to the commander of the JATF, and that is exactly what we did. Every time those opposite have criticised the way information is being handled in terms of maritime operations they are actually criticising the measures put in place by the commander of the JATF, because that is the body and that is the commander who has advised me on those policies.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         I am not surprised that the Leader of the Opposition has not risen to the member for Denison's challenge here today, because he wishes to continue the attacks and undermining of this government and its policies and now that attack has shamefully gone at the hands of Senator Conroy to attacking one of the most distinguished men ever to pull on a uniform for this country.

                                           I rise on a point of order. Madam Speaker, as you would probably be aware, the motion moved by the member for Denison bears no resemblance whatsoever to the amendment being suggested by the Manager of Opposition Business—it is an entirely different matter. In which case the amendment is therefore out of order and cannot be accepted by the chair. If the Manager of Opposition Business wants to move a different motion at another time, we would be more than happy to consider it, but this is a motion about the actions of Senator Conroy; it is not a motion about the entire military defence forces.

Earlier today we had an instance where I gave the call to the Leader of the Opposition; I expected him to answer a question; he did not do it. He spoke on indulgence without first seeking it, but I let it pass. But on this occasion I had made a ruling; I had put the motion; the motion is now carried; and we will move on to the rest of business.
