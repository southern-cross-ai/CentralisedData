        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to parliament: Integrated fit-out of new leased premises for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        at the site known as Site 5 and 6, the Revitalising Central Dandenong project, Dandenong, Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        I referred this project to the Public Works Committee on 10 December 2013. The project was originally referred to the committee in May 2013, but the referral lapsed when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Taxation Office has a substantial presence in the Dandenong region and is currently located in the building at 14 to 16 Mason Street, Dandenong, which has a lease in place which expires on 31 December 2015. It is expected that the relocation into a new building will provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies and long-term viability through improvements in building infrastructure. The ATO is committed to maintaining a long-term presence in Dandenong, and the project has the support of the Greater Dandenong City Council. The estimated cost of the proposal is $21.3 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        and includes all costs associated with an integrated fit-out as well as furniture, work stations and builders' costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Works Committee provided its report on the project to the House and to the Senate earlier this week. In its report, the Public Works Committee concluded that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and that the new accommodation will be fit for purpose. The committee has therefore recommended that the works proceed and recommended that the House resolve that it is expedient to carry out the proposed works.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I indicated when referring the project to the committee, subject to parliamentary approval the proposed works are scheduled to start in August 2014 and to be completed by 1 October 2015. The developer will commence base building work on site in March 2014, with earthworks and excavation for the basement areas being the first tasks.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee, under the leadership of its chair, Mrs Karen Andrews, the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        , for considering this project in such a timely manner and for its support. I commend the motion to the House.
