        I rise in this place today to talk about the scourge of elder abuse and a wonderful Townsville flash mob—Seniors Creating Change—whose music and singing are an innovative way to educate the community about elder abuse. Seniors Creating Change is supported by the Townsville Community Legal Service. I also rise to deliver a message about the cuts that are affecting older persons which can create an environment where elder abuse can occur.

        I had the great pleasure of witnessing Seniors Creating Change perform on 18 May 2017 when I opened the new office space for Everglow community aged care in Townsville. Everglow is a not-for-profit, community based organisation that aims to bring out the best in its clients so they can remain at home with their community. Seniors Creating Change has a very clear message for this government. In fact, they have written a song to the tune of Nancy Sinatra's 'These Boots are Made for Walking' called 'The Seniors Funding Song'. I will not be singing it because I cannot sing, but I will read the words. It goes like this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We were promised, if we paid our taxes,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That we'd get the pension but confess
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You've been messin' where you shouldn't have been messin'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now seniors are getting' less and less.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our voice is made for singin' and that's just what we'll do,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And one of these days our voices will be listened to by you!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You keep cutting what you ought to be increasin',
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You keep takin' what you oughta not touch,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You think sendin' Seniors to the poor house
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Is the only way to kowtow to the rich.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our voice is made for singin' and that's just what we'll do,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And one of these days our voices will be listened to by you!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You keep changin' what you shouldn't be changin',
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You keep thinkin' that we'll just sit back … Ha!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You just found out that we ain't gonna take it,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And what we know is right is gonna be heard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our voice is made for singin' and that's just what we'll do,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And one of these days our voices will be listened to by you!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need respect … for what we give!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need respect … for how we live!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need respect … because we vote!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need respect … We live in hope!
       </p>
       <p>
        Our seniors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. They deserve to live in peace, be safe, have access to quality health care and certainly to live above the poverty line.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to assist seniors to prevent elder abuse, the Townsville Community Legal Service has also developed a prevention plan with four key pillars: structural and social change; capacity building and early intervention; legal casework, social work advice and assistance; and harm reduction and rehabilitation. We must do better for our seniors.
