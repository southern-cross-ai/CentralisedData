       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. Minister, the chair of the Regional Universities Network says the Abbott government's university changes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … will have a disproportionate impact on the regional and disadvantaged students who study at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUN" rel="nofollow">
         RUN
        </a>
        universities, as well as the communities from which they come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, he said the changes were:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … likely to exacerbate the divide between the city and rural and regional Australia …
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, how can you stand by and watch agriculture and veterinary science students and their communities—including Armidale—pay the price for the Americanisation of our universities?

         It is amazing. I have received two questions in this place now. The first question was from the member for Sydney. Now I have a question from the shadow minister for agriculture—on education. But I guess you have to take small graces when they come! Two people have asked questions: you and the member for Sydney. You are the only two.
        </p>
        <p>
         The organisation that the shadow minister refers to, the Regional Universities Network, actually supports the changes we are making—yes, with amendments, but they support the changes. I can also tell the member for Hunter that, in discussions with Annabelle Duncan of the University of New England, they said, 'The status quo is unacceptable.' Where did the status quo that is unacceptable come from, Member for Hunter? It came from your side! I am looking forward to the progression of the scholarships so that people from towns such as Brewarrina, Quilpie and other towns out west get their chance to go to university, get their chance to participate in the future of our nation. I would welcome, at some stage—maybe in the next year or two—a question from the shadow minister for agriculture about agriculture!

          Order! There will be silence. The member for Isaacs has been warned—once more and he will leave us.
