        Congratulations, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Defence: Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is working with Australia's strategic partners to secure a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I want to thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for her question. I recognise the fact that she's a very strong supporter of defence industry in her electorate. Only a few days ago, it was announced that Aerospace in her electorate on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         will provide to the

        </p>
        <p>
         This government, of course, is investing at a record level when it comes to defence, because we mean what we say when we say that we're going to have the backs of our

           We live in a very uncertain time in the Indo-Pacific. It's recognised by countries in our region, it's recognised by the United States and it's recognised by Europeans, including
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
            NATO
           </a>
           , and many others have had comment on that. The fact is that, now, for our country, is not for a time for weakness but a time for strength. When we look at what the Labor Party presided over when they were in government, they weakened the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           , and we are recovering from it. I say that because the fact is that the Labor Party cut funding from defence. They cut it to a level which was equivalent to 1.56 per cent of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           , the lowest level since 1938. Mr Speaker, if you want to see an example of weakness when it comes to national security, find yourself a government that cuts defence spending on the cusp of an uncertain period in our region.

             This Leader of the Opposition was a central figure in the Rudd and Gillard governments. He was there for every decision that was made by Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard, not just in relation to cutting defence spending and taking money away from the soldiers of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Defence Force
             </a>
             ; he was there when they made decisions—in fact, he was a chief advocate of policy which resulted in this country losing control of our borders. The more this Leader of the Opposition is known to the Australian people, the more they know he is a weak, weak leader. If they want to ask a question, I'm happy to take a question, but I've been in this portfolio for 239 days, and the opposition defence spokesman hasn't asked one question.
