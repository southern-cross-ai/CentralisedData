       <p>
        I rise today to correct the record for I have been grievously misquoted to have said things that I clearly have not said. On Saturday morning, I was interviewed on Sky News, on their
        <i>
         AM Agenda
        </i>
        program. At that interview, I spoke at length on the horror of the terrorist events that we have seen take place in our country in the past few years, including at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Place" rel="nofollow">
         Martin Place
        </a>
        and, more recently, in Parramatta. In that interview I described those events as shocking. Let me be clear: we do have a problem with a small yet significant group of people falling prey to the evil and twisted ideologies of radical
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Islam in Australia
        </a>
        . This is not the Australia I believe in. This is not the Australia I want. Further to the comments of the honourable member for Berowra, I do not believe it is the Australia that we as a parliament agree with.
       </p>
       <p>
        I come from a wonderful place in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        and I do not think there is a more exceptional example of social inclusion than the Western Sydney Wanderers. We have a peaceful country and, if people want to come and choose to be part of our values and choose to enjoy our peace, then we welcome them. But there are people who choose to ravage our streets and murder innocent people leaving their home, and that is not an Australia I agree with in any way, shape or form. Those people, like the Prime Minister has said, perhaps need to find somewhere else to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken on these events and I have spoken on my views in this place on numerous occasions. In fact, my opinion on these events has been quite consistent. We in this place have a responsibility to build a safer Australia and to keep Australians safe against these insidious threats. That is why we have the need to create measures to ensure we keep Australians safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the Sky News interview, I was not even referring to recent events. In fact, I was referring to an event that took place in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Broken Hill
        </a>
        over a century ago. Perhaps with 2020 hindsight, I could have chosen my words slightly better. Should people have taken my words out of context and the words have caused them offence, then I am sorry. To suggest that I was referring to recent events is not only offensive but completely ridiculous. Like all Australians, I was shocked, appalled and angered to see the terrorist attacks in my home state, my home city of Parramatta, and Martin Place. Let us not forget that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Monis" rel="nofollow">
         Man Monis
        </a>
        lived in my electorate at a time. For people to think that I have a different opinion is beyond offensive. This is the first duty of government: to keep all Australians safe. That is why I have strongly supported the antiterrorism measures that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        have put forward and, in most cases, they have been very much supported by the opposition. As a parliament, we all see the need to keep Australians safe. I will continue to support the government's efforts to defeat terrorism and to ensure that all Australians are safe on our streets.
