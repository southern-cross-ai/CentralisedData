        . Will the minister update the House on steps the coalition government has taken to protect Australian families from dangerous visa-holders, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I'm proud of the fact the government has a strong policy on cancelling the visas of noncitizens—people who are in our country as tourists, as guests, as workers—who commit crimes against Australians. They can expect to have their visas cancelled. In fact, under this government, we have cancelled some 3,300 visas of dangerous noncitizens, and Australians are safer because of it. It is in stark contrast, not only in this area but also in the area of border protection, to Labor. Labor was weak as well in that area of public policy. We know that, in the last three months, we've cancelled more visas of dangerous criminals who were in our country than Labor did in their first three years in government. Of the 3,300, we've cancelled the visas of 135 rapists, 260 child sex offenders and 170 members of outlaw motorcycle gangs.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we've reported to the House before, the visa cancellations of outlaw motorcycle gang members have not been welcomed by all Australians, because, as we know, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         , the most militant union in the country, employs the services of outlaw motorcycle gang members—because the outlaw motorcycle gang members aren't only involved in the distribution of ice and amphetamines around the country; they aren't only involved in extortion of shop owners and families around the country; they are also engaged in the CFMEU's protection racket on building sites around the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, there is somebody in this House who has a particular connection to the CFMEU. It is, of course, our old friend the Leader of the Opposition. The CFMEU has donated tens of millions of dollars to the Labor Party. We see in today's
         <i>

         a story by

         </a>
         where he details again the involvement of the Leader of the Opposition and the encouragement, through his words, of those lawless thugs involved in the CFMEU. We know that members of outlaw motorcycle gangs have now infiltrated the union movement, the CFMEU, and it seems that the Leader of the Opposition has learnt not only how to take money from the CFMEU but also—

          The minister will just pause for a second. He can't make a claim that the Leader of the Opposition has taken money from the

             I withdraw the personal inference. I am sure that has never taken place! This person is of impeccable character! I have no doubt. He has been involved in a number of affairs across his adult life. He's broken trust with so many people across his adult life. There are many members behind him who have been doublecrossed by this Leader of the Opposition. There are many people involved in the union movement, involved in the Labor Party, who cannot trust a word that this Leader of the Opposition says. And you know what, Mr Speaker? The Australian public has formed the same judgement.
