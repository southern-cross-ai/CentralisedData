       <p>
        I rise this afternoon to encourage community organisations, voluntary groups, clubs, societies and the like in my electorate to look at opportunities in the next Stronger Communities Program funding round. This fund is an important fund because it provides amounts up to $20,000 for community organisations for a variety of things which can help them. What I've found over the years is that it's often small amounts of money that make a big difference to local communities, to the volunteers and organisations who are providing such important service in all of our electorates, including my electorate of Menzies.
       </p>

        For those who are thinking about what sorts of things are funded, can I just indicate the list of funding from the last round as an indication to other organisations of the sorts of things that might consider. For example, there was funding to the Templestowe
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub Branch to upgrade their air-conditioning facilities. There was a grant for Quambee Reserve in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwood_North" rel="nofollow">
         Ringwood North
        </a>
        to upgrade its female changing room facilities—I have spoken about this before. One of the pleasant challenges of the increased participation of women in sport is the need to upgrade particularly changing rooms and similar facilities at many sporting venues throughout the country. Croydon Hills Community Men's Shed received funding for the construction of a clean eating area. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
         Coptic Orthodox
        </a>
        church in Bulleen received funding to upgrade their outdoor area. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Air_League" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Air League
        </a>
        's Doncaster Squadron used a funding grant to upgrade educational equipment—something very important for young people in the Australian Air League. The Friends of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrandyte_State_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Warrandyte State Park
        </a>
        installed a watering system with the grant that they received through this program.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing that pleased me greatly was the purchase by Doncare of two vehicles to assist with donation collection and to transport special needs patients. They are two vehicles that are very much in use every day by Doncare, the major voluntary welfare organisation in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Schramms Sports Club in Doncaster upgraded their kitchen facilities. The Veneto Club in Bulleen, like Quambee, have upgraded their female changing rooms. I was delighted to visit the Veneto Club just recently to look at the changes that have been made there. Hundreds, if not thousands, of young women are now playing sport at the club. The Manningham Men's Shed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doncaster_East" rel="nofollow">
         Doncaster East
        </a>
        upgraded a walkway and heating and cooling facilities. The Bulleen Templestowe Amateur Football Club restored lighting facilities at the Ted Ajani Reserve and purchased and an electronic scoreboard. Doncaster RSL Sub Branch did some restoration and repairs to their club rooms. The Templestowe Junior Football Club installed lighting with their grant. The Doncaster Cricket Club provided storage facilities and equipment to provide for those playing cricket. Finally, in the last round's grants, St Mark's Anglican Church in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templestowe_Lower" rel="nofollow">
         Templestowe Lower
        </a>
        constructed a community garden and meeting place. They are all very worthy projects.
