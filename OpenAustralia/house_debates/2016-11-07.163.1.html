        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . Today I wish to acknowledge each and every one of those pillars of our community in this great place in parliament. Something like 140,000 Gold Coast residents volunteer each year with the combined impact in the community of some $6 billion. Our volunteers truly are the glue that holds our community together.

        Our volunteers that received an award last Friday include Kay Hobson from Volunteers in Policing; Beverly Sharp from the Lynne Richardson Community Centre; Katrina Dunbar, chair of the Gaven State School P? Alex Wells, who started an inclusive sports program at her school LORDS;
