        I rise tonight to speak briefly about a recent event that I was involved in, being CyclePower Fiji. CyclePower Fiji was a test of cycling skill or, in my case, a lack thereof, which was sponsored by Disability Sport and Recreation Victoria. Disability Sport and Recreation Victoria is the health promotion peak organisation of the disability, sport and recreation sector in Victoria. Their mission is to provide and promote positive health outcomes for Victorians with a disability through participation in sport and recreation.
       </p>
       <p>
        CyclePower was initiated by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSR" rel="nofollow">
         DSR
        </a>
        . CyclePower aims to raise funds to improve and increase opportunities for people with disability to participate in sport and recreation. It also seeks to demonstrate the abilities of people with a disability, particularly in developing nations: previously, in Vietnam and Cambodia but on this occasion, in 2013, in Fiji. CyclePower on this occasion involved a 500-plus kilometre ride around the main island of Fiji. It was recently completed by eight able-bodied participants and nine participants with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        CyclePower Fiji aimed to use sport and recreation as a means to reduce the stigma associated with disability in Fiji. It also aims to promote the health benefits of sport and recreation for people with disability. This year CyclePower saw its largest contingency of handcyclists. On the way around, CyclePower Fiji donated sports equipment to Nadi Special Development School. A wheelchair basketball chair was also donated to the Fijian Paralympic Committee. CyclePower Fiji also raised funds to support Victorians with disability to participate in sport and recreation.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were some great people participating—people like Gary Connor. This was Gary's third trip for CyclePower. He is the CyclePower ambassador. Gary, who has been a paraplegic for over 18 years, takes on a mentor role for those with disability and he would go out of his way to assist other riders. The 47-year-old father of two took up cycling to ride with his children. Gary shows people what can be achieved when you really have a go. Ray Losionek, in his third year with CyclePower, is a double amputee. Unsure whether he could ride in CyclePower this year due to major bowel cancer surgery in December, Ray proved the doctors wrong and rode the whole distance. A 66-year-old father and grandfather, Ray was the oldest participant. This did not stop him from challenging a Paralympian on the ride to a race with Ray coming out on top—not something that I could say!
       </p>
       <p>
        CyclePower Fiji was the second ride for Sam Bramhan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . The athlete missed out last year due to training for the Paralympic team. This young Rotarian of the year uses humour to educate people on disability and is an amputee from birth. Peter Hyden acquired his disability in an accident 18 months ago. Now a paraplegic, Peter saw CyclePower as an opportunity to learn from other handcyclists not only about sport but also the everyday challenges he now faces. Peter was supported by his wife, Meran, who had not cycled for over 30 years but completed the whole ride. It was a gutsy performance from both of them.

        and Leanne Del Toso, or 'Dory', are former members of the 'Gliders' Australian women's wheelchair basketball team and will be again. Medallists at the Paralympics, these women have trained together for years. CyclePower was the goal they set for themselves after the Paralympics and they did it with style. Belinda Curro has just completed her third year with CyclePower—not even a move to Darwin could stop her. In 2008, at 28 weeks pregnant, Belinda was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Requiring emergency surgery, Belinda was told by doctors she would not be able to walk, talk or even eat. Belinda is now the mother of three children under 10 years old, works and recently represented the

        Troy Hawkins is 23-years-old, born with spina bifida, has been a member of DSR for years. As a personal trainer he understands the importance of maintaining fitness. He worked hard on this trip and, while it was a difficult time for him, he did his best. Alex Gale-Grime is a 20-year-old with fight. Born with spina bifida, Alex motivated her father, Warrick, to participate in CyclePower two years ago. On this ride, Alex completed it with her father. They worked together and it was great to see. Other people, such as Karla Wignall and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Anderson
        </a>
        from DSR, Kirsty Smith, Gabrielle Williams and Anne Jenes, all took part in the ride. It was a great experience—something I was very pleased to be part of.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank the people from Raw Travel: Dave Reynolds, Craig and Geoff Hilder—they did a great job in difficult circumstances. Well done; it was not easy. I also have to mention on behalf of all participants those 'bloody undulating hills'. Never let it be said that Fiji is flat. Congrats to all. It was a real achievement. I am very proud to have been part of it. I have been very proud to be there and see the gutsy work of those who were involved. It was inspiring, not only amongst themselves but also to all Australians to see what can be done when you have got a disability.
