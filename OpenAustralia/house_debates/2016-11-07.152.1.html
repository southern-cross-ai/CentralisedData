        Mr Speaker, as I am sure you are aware, last week was the Grafton Jacaranda Festival. It was another great event and we had more international tourists this year—the numbers are growing every year. In fact, last week, at one stage, I had to actually stop driving along the road because there was an overseas tourist lying on his back in the middle of the road taking photos of the lovely Jacaranda trees. They are more than welcome and so is the tourist dollar they bring with them. I would also like to congratulate the Jacaranda Queen contestants, Shannon Carter, Heidi Madsen and Sharni Wren. Sharni was crowned the 2016 Jacaranda Queen, and I congratulate her. Well done to the Junior Jacaranda Queen entrants, Lucy Hackett, Chloe Hallam, Ariana Smajster, Faith Sullivan and Annelise Uren.

        There was also a beautiful baby competition and the grand champion was Unique Laurie-Davis and the runner-up was Dominic Wheatley.

        In the girls 0 to 6 months category, Unique Laurie Davis was first and Phoebe Lee Senz was second; in the 7 to 12 months category, Lucyana Corbett was first and Xanthe Jackson second; in the 13 to 18 months category Navaiah Turner was first and Kalahni Bettison second; and in the 19 to 24 months category Darcy Falcke was first and Jordyn Reti second. I congratulate everyone involved in what was yet another wonderful Jacaranda Festival week.

        Recently students from the Northern Rivers Shukokai Karate Dojo travelled to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        to compete in the national all styles tournament. I am proud to announce that six of those students went on to compete at the Queensland state titles. Kane Williams, Imogen Crampton, Emily Le, Frederika Yee, Ruth Potts and Tia Steele all competed in the titles, with Imogen and Frederika both coming first in their respective divisions. These talented students will now be competing in the national titles in late November in Melbourne. Having six students competing in the national titles is a huge achievement for such a small dojo and it is testament to the hard work, passion and determination under the leadership of Barry Potts. I congratulate all involved.

        The Orara Valley Ball was held on Saturday. This is a great event hosted by the Orara Valley Progress Association. The ball raises money for projects within the valley. Members of the Orara Valley Axemen football club spent three days before the event setting up. They helped with everything from erecting the marquee to putting down the dance floor. They were helped by the Nana Glen Rural Fire Service members. It is a true community event with many people freely giving their time. The ball could not have happened without people such as Loraine and Peter Waller,
