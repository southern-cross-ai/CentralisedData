        </a>
        on their coronations. Along with other Commonwealth realms, Australia welcomes the new King and Queen and the beginning of a new era. The coronation of a new monarch has occurred only four times since Australia became a nation. At Federation on 1 January 1901,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Queen Victoria
        </a>
        was coming to the end of her long and remarkable reign. Her sons and grandsons followed her through the first tumultuous half of the 20th century; then her great-great-granddaughter, crowned 70 years ago, went on to eclipse her record to become Britain's longest-serving monarch. Until her passing last year, Queen
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth II
        </a>
        was the only reigning monarch most Australians had ever known, and the only one to visit our shores. Australians' personal respect and affection and admiration for her remarkable service will never fade.
       </p>
       <p>
        As King Charles takes up the duties his mother so faithfully fulfilled, he makes the same promise of lifelong service and the same commitment to the institutions of democracy that she vowed to uphold. The new King and Queen clearly intend to serve with energy, integrity and empathy. In his first speech as King, His Majesty paid tribute to the fine example his mother had set and promised to serve with loyalty, respect and love for people, irrespective of their backgrounds or beliefs. He spoke of the way that society had changed over his lifetime, transforming into one of many cultures and many faiths, even as the bedrock values of freedom and responsibility remain constant.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coronation itself is, in a profound sense, a part of this conversation between tradition and change, continuity and renewal. Even as he performs a role that has endured for almost a thousand years, the King makes his pledge in a modern world with a promise to the future. For more than 50 years, His Majesty King Charles has been a passionate champion of the environment, espousing the belief that we must think seven generations ahead to have any chance of leaving a better world behind us. He has a long record of interest in climate change, the urban environment and sustainability. As his reign begins, Australians know that we have a friend who celebrates our successes and stands with us in our times of disaster and distress, and a friend with a deep and abiding interest in issues relating to Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people.
       </p>
       <p>
        His Majesty is no stranger to our shores. As a 17-year-old in 1966, he spent six months at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong Grammar School
        </a>
        's Timbertop campus in the Victorian High Country. Recounting the story years later, he told an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        crowd in London, 'If you want to develop character, go to Australia.' He has also professed his enduring love for the experience and described how it left him with a huge affection for our country—and I can assure the parliament that, when I have had the privilege of having an audience with King Charles, that affection has shone through. We look forward to welcoming him once again to Australia. This time, as one of 15 countries, it will be as our head of state.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the King's mother, Elizabeth II, acceded to the throne on 6 February 1952, Australia's parliament expressed its faith in her as she took on the great responsibilities of the Crown and wished her a rich and kind reign. The world has changed radically since then, and Australia has grown into a mature and diverse nation, confident about who we are and our place in the world. As a mature nation, we will continue to examine our own constitutional arrangements and determine what they should be. King Charles has made it clear that these are matters that are rightly determined by nations of the Commonwealth and that those decisions are to be respected.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an honour to attend the coronation and have private audiences with King Charles and the Prince of Wales,

         Australians were glued to their televisions on Saturday night to watch our new King and Queen crowned. It was a wonderful occasion. It was historical, heartening and happy. As we watched on, we were all proud to see the Prime Minister and the Governor-General there on behalf of our nation. I want to acknowledge you, Prime Minister; His Excellency General the Hon.

         Most of us have only ever lived under one monarch, such was the extraordinary 70-year reign of Queen
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">
          Elizabeth II
         </a>
         . Thus the crowning of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles" rel="nofollow">
          King Charles
         </a>
         III, our new sovereign, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla" rel="nofollow">
          Queen Camilla
         </a>
         , who was at his side, was a truly momentous occasion. It was a momentous occasion for the British people, for Australians and for all citizens of the Commonwealth. It was a moment when an age-old tradition brought with it both a sense of reconnection to history and regeneration in our times. It was a moment of celebration that resonated around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Charles was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He was the boy who waited, the prince of patience and a king seven decades in the making. No other royal has journeyed longer to sit on the British throne and no other royal has been so prepared to wear the crown. Succeeding her father on the throne at age 25, Elizabeth was the Queen that we came to know and, succeeding his mother on the throne at age 73, Charles is the King that we already know. We know that he will be a decent, dedicated and well-disposed King.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his biography of Charles,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andersen" rel="nofollow">
          Christopher Andersen
         </a>
         recounted Elizabeth's coronation day. The newly crowned Queen emerged onto the balcony at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" rel="nofollow">
          Buckingham Palace
         </a>
         cheered by a crowd of one million Britons. Next to her of course was her four-year-old son, Charles. In that moment the boy first understood how much his mother was loved by her people. In that moment young Charles first grasped the importance of the bond between the people and their monarch, a bond which held that country together and a bond that kept the Commonwealth united and strong.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his first speech as King on 9 September last year, which the Prime Minister referenced earlier, Charles said that his beloved mother was an inspiration and example to him. In that address Charles's renewed promise of lifelong service echoed the promise his mother made on her 21st birthday. The King went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavour to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Day
         </a>
         address on 13 March, the King described the Commonwealth as a constant in his life, as an association of shared values, common purpose, joint action and extraordinary potential. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The myriad connections between our nations have sustained and enriched us for more than seven decades. Our commitment to peace, progress and opportunity will sustain us for many more.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our sovereign has a great affinity, as we know, for Australia. In many ways it was Charles's first trip to Australia which transformed the boy into the man.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen" rel="nofollow">
          The Queen

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" rel="nofollow">
          Prince Philip
         </a>
         arranged for young Charles to attend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
          Geelong Grammar School
         </a>
         on an exchange program in 1966, particularly to attend the remote Timbertop campus in the foothills of the Victorian alps. There, students received traditional classroom lessons combined with activities in the bush to develop resilience, self-reliance and strength. If Prince Philip had hoped the experience would test the young Charles' mettle and put some steel in him, he was right, for soon the 17-year-old prince was hiking, cross-country running, fishing, chopping wood and supervising younger students. He learned about natural history, and he encountered every Englishman's worst nightmare: huntsman spiders, tiger snakes, dragon lizards, leeches, fruit bats and bull ants. Meanwhile, under the guidance of history head Michael Collins Persse, with whom he would develop a lifelong friendship, Charles worked away at his A-levels, and in his public appearances, like meeting lifesavers at

He described it as by far the best part of his entire education and something he would always cherish. Charles has visited our nation on 16 occasions spanning 10 different prime ministers. Notably, he attended the funerals of prime ministers Holt and Menzies on behalf of the Queen. He celebrated the 200th anniversaries of both James Cook's and the First Fleet's arrivals in Australia.

         after being shot at by a student with a starting pistol. Our sovereign appreciates all too well our harsh and unforgiving climate. Never has Charles been remiss in sending wishes to Australians besieged by bushfires, floods and other natural disasters. At an Australian bushfire appeal in London in 2020 he said:

        <p class="italic">

         , the conservationist who has passionately campaigned for environmental protection and sustainability since his first public speech aged 21 and the enthusiastic spectator and sportsman who has dabbled in many sports and is a very keen and fierce advocate for the arts in all their forms. At the 1988 bicentennial celebrations, Charles said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is no point now in trying to gloss over the circumstances in which the country, of which you are rightly proud, began.

         He spoke of our nation's harsh beginnings and the hardship for all—for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , the original people of this land; for the convicts sent against this will to an unknown country, which would have felt like another prison. But Charles also spoke of the Australian achievement, of the intelligence and courage of brave men and women who, in an astonishingly brief time, in a heartbeat of history, created a whole new free country. He spoke proudly of Australia being its own creation, a democracy which has become a model for the world, and of how that creation became the British gift of the rule of law. Profoundly, he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The true celebration of this nation is in its constitution. In those dry-sounding but hard fought for rules and regulations, every family in this remarkable country has its rights protected and cherished.
        </p>
        <p>
         With our sovereign and his queen crowned, we celebrate change, but we also celebrate our historical connections with Britain and the British inheritance: representative democracy, parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, the separation of powers, the English language, and freedom of speech, of association, the press and much more besides. May we never take this British inheritance for granted. May we continue to be custodians and defenders in the spirit of our own unique Australian creation, and may we always be proud of our British origins, along with our Indigenous heritage and our migration and multicultural success—three strands of our national story. King Charles is our head of state. In the crowning of a new king and all that the monarch symbolises, we remind ourselves of those British institutions and values which our forebears drew upon to forge a modern nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just like his mother, King Charles does not yearn for a return to empire. He understands that this is a vestige of the past, that the empire has receded into history. Importantly, our sovereign respects the right of the peoples of the Commonwealth to define their own destinies. In a speech on Australia Day in '94, the Prince said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … there are those who would wish to see such a rapidly changing world reflected by a change in Australia's institutions … it is also not surprising that there are differing views: some people will doubtless prefer the stability of a system that has been reasonably well-tried and tested over the years …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The point I want to make here … is that this is something which only you—the Australian people—can decide.
        </p>

          The Prince

         went on to say that he will always have 'an enormous affection' for our country, 'whatever course Australians ultimately decide upon', and in the meantime all his family 'will continue to take a close, personal interest in the welfare and fortunes of this country'. Those words, I think, show the humility, grace, generosity and understanding befitting a modern monarch. Our new King's virtues and values echo what we saw in our dearly departed Queen. Today, on behalf of the coalition and joining with this House, I congratulate Their Majesties.
