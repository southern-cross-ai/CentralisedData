        Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Health. Mental illness affects one in five Australians every year, often in dreadful ways and especially in Tasmania. Clearly a better approach is desperately needed at both federal and state levels, yet the National
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Commission's review of mental health programs and services has been shunted off to another committee. Minister, what is going on and when will the community see some big changes for the better?

         I thank the member for Denison—I appreciate his ongoing engagement with me on these very important matters. It is correct that more than half of us will suffer some form of mental ill-health over our lifetime. Last week I released a report into child and adolescent mental health which revealed that one in seven children and young people suffer from a mental health disorder and one in 10 teenagers have attempted some form of self-harm. On coming into government we promised a review. The National
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         Commission, appointed by the previous government, was tasked by us to conduct this review, and it found an alarming and disturbing picture of the patchwork of mental health services, poorly targeted and, most importantly, not producing the goods for the consumers and their families. There were three key themes to this report—that early intervention and community-based service make a real difference; that stepped care is the most appropriate form of care, with the level of severity being matched to the form of care that is available to the patient; and that a local regionalised approach works best—as we know only too well, Canberra does not always know best and local solutions provided by good groups in the community can make a real and lasting difference. The government heartily endorses these three key themes of the National Mental Health Commission's Review.

         Recently I tasked

         </a>
         and an expert reference group to conduct not another review—with great respect, member for Denison—but a task force about implementation, about how we translate these important recommendations into government policy, and a funding mechanism that makes sense through two levels of government. That, of course, is a very complex process. That is a time-limited process. I keep in regular contact with Kate Carnell— a very good person in this space, as we all recognise. We also all recognise, as members of parliament, that there are important changes to be made. We all see people with mental health conditions come through our door and we all know it is really hard for someone who is perfectly well to navigate the system let alone somebody who is struggling. Kate Carnell's group will be reporting to me soon. The government and I will make some strong statements about policy reform before the end of the year, and I look forward to the parliament's support. These reforms, as well as our key measures in the area of the
