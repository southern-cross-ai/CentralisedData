       <p>
        The mean and tricky decision by this government to axe the non-contributory parent visa and other family visa categories—including the aged dependent relative, remaining relative and carer visa categories—is an absolute disgrace. It is another example of the extraordinarily unfair nature of this budget, and it again highlights that the burden of this budget falls on the shoulders of low- and middle-income Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012-13, some 2,150 people were reunited with their families under the non-contributory parent visa. But this government, with the flick of a pen, has slammed the door on such families. Not only is this an unfair act; the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection—someone who seems to forget that his title includes 'immigration'—snuck this move through by legislative instrument only a few days ago without any consultation with the community. Indeed, it was only last week at Senate budget estimates that the department said they were 'not sure' when the changes would take effect, and now we see the repeal lodged in the House of Representatives one week later, to come into effect last Monday. This is a cruel blow to many people from migrant backgrounds, especially those on low and middle incomes. This government will be held to account for their callous disregard for ethnic communities. Members of my community are outraged by this. Those opposite cannot sell their rotten budget and our communities are onto them like a shot.
