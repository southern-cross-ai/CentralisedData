        I want to raise tonight a subject where the local impact is difficult to fully assess but which nevertheless constantly affects our community. The reach of homelessness extends far into all of our communities, some seen and some unseen. There are a number of factors that cause people to end up in this situation. At all levels of government—local, state and federal—we are constantly working to try and address these issues. Indeed, it is one I'm currently working on, across the political spectrum and across levels of government locally since the closure of the local service

        In Dunkley, many local organisations work to address the needs of those to whom accommodation and food is unavailable, for whatever reason—such as schools like

        and the team at Community Support Frankston also do an absolutely amazing job in supporting some of the most vulnerable people in Frankston and surrounds.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSF" rel="nofollow">

        is one of the busiest agencies of its type in Victoria, with nearly 13,000 people contacting the organisation for assistance last year. They are a not-for-profit community support agency—about to celebrate 50 years—which provide services including emergency food, grocery vouchers, help with utility bills, referrals and advocacy for people who live or work in the city of Frankston. The agency helps to provide people with information, advice and skills, so they gain the ability to make more-effective life choices within their community. They have approximately 80 volunteer community workers from a wide range of social, political, religious, cultural and work backgrounds, who provide their time and services free of charge. And, as I said, the agency has been doing this for 50 years.

        Community Support Frankston has found in recent years that the demand for their services has dramatically increased. The Stronger Communities Program round from 2016 provided them with $15,000 of federal funding, for additional storage for the increase in donations they were receiving. The 2017 round will fund for them a shelter to provide a weather-protected area for food deliveries and will also provide food to those who need it. The level of support within the community for these critical services is fantastic, and, as regrettable as is the need for these assets, together we are working to lower the degree of need in Dunkley.

        visited CSF when in Frankston and is aware of the funding reductions that occurred in the years prior to my election. I am fighting for restoration of this important funding for CSF.

        Life-Gate is another organisation that does important work. Reverend Angel and Pastor Ulli Roldan work to equip and empower individuals and families to overcome crises such as drug and alcohol addictions and other life-controlling problems—suicidal tendencies, abuse, broken relationships and depression—and ultimately to fulfil their full potential in life. Life-Gate have recently acquired a specially designed and appropriately fitted out barbecue trailer with running water and a slide-out barbecue that will replace their makeshift food van. I was pleased the federal government and I were able to help their 'meals for change' project, providing $10,000 of federal funding through the Stronger Communities Program.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Life" rel="nofollow">

        also received a grant under the recent round of the Stronger Communities Program funding, worth $10,000 for their family relationship centre facilities. These kinds of services are critical in preventing or addressing family breakdowns, working to mitigating the risks posed to some of the more vulnerable members of our community. With a very similar focus, recently, the Turnbull government provided $117 million over five years to 102 Reconnect services across Australia, including the Salvation Army's Peninsula Youth &amp; Family Services. Reconnect provides support and assistance to young people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, working to address many of the concerns before vulnerable young people in Dunkley find themselves in situations that escalate to the point that they have no support and accommodation. The Salvos youth and family centre on the

        will provide counselling, family mediation and practical support to find accommodation for young people and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that point, I must also mention the work of Fusion who operate from the former Balcombe Army barracks and support young people in my electorate but also in the neighbouring electorate of the Minister for Health, the member for Flinders. By keeping people at risk of homelessness connected with their families, communities, education and employment opportunities, we can work to prevent people falling into homelessness. Ultimately, some people do fall through the cracks, and it is good to know that when they do there are many services and concerned residents who are able to help. Thank you.
