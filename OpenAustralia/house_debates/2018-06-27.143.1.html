        Recently I spoke in the House about personal income tax cuts and company tax cuts. I spoke about a country that used to reward prosperity. Australia used to be a place where you could get ahead if you worked hard. I am evidence of that. I worked hard in my transport operations. I succeeded. I paid my tax. It is the dream of every Australian to work hard and aspire, to give it everything. But it is becoming increasingly evident that not everyone in this place believes in that. Labor doesn't believe in people who work hard, it would appear. Labor doesn't believe in people getting ahead.

        An opposition member: Rubbish.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hear from the other side the word 'rubbish'. We put up a tax reform bill, and the member on the other side who just mentioned 'rubbish' voted against it. Labor voted against hardworking Australians getting ahead. If they get into government, they are going to introduce tax reform that punishes every person earning over $75,000. That tax bracket is the new elite, the new wealthy, for Labor. They are the people that are coming over.
       </p>

        Do you know who those people are in my electorate? They're the diesel fitters. They're the diesel mechanics. They're the schoolteachers and principals of band-5 schools—24 kids. They are Labor's new elite. They are the people that Labor are going to come after.

        This week in the Senate we're going to be discussing company tax rates. I'm going to bring to the attention of the house where Australia sits with reference to competitiveness in the

        Good. And I would encourage you to table those numbers because I'm going to table these documents. The document I have in front of me is the OECD corporate tax rates. In front of Australia are Hungary, with under 10 per cent; and Ireland, 12 per cent. The

        and Greece all are lower than us. Next are Germany, Mexico, and—boom!—then we get Australia. Guess who's behind us? Portugal and France.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we don't move in this space we will lose our international competitiveness. It is absurd to think that companies are going to come to Australia and make long-term investments of 20 years unless we make ourselves competitive. Those on the other side should be condemned because they are hamstringing this nation and crippling this country's growth.
