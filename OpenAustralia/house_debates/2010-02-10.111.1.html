        I rise this morning to table a petition received from around 120 of my constituents from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        petitioning the parliament to reject the Greens proposal to alter the definition of marriage. The petition says: ‘We, the undersigned citizens, draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex marriage, as proposed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage" rel="nofollow">
         Marriage
        </a>
        Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens, therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 be opposed.’
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of marriage was amended by the former coalition government, of which I was a part. I am pleased to place on the record my strong support for the point of view of those who have signed this petition. I stress that I certainly know that for many people the desire to ensure the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman indicates not a discrimination against people of the same sex seeking to be in a relationship but rather the fundamental belief that marriage is a predominantly Christian institution in this country. For that reason, those of the same sex seeking to be married run contrary to that very institution. Therefore, I am pleased that we amended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Marriage Act
        </a>
        to define marriage as a heterosexual relationship between a man and a woman. I further stress that I also believe that the same exclusion should apply to the right to adopt children.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        proposal by Senator Hanson-Young would dramatically alter the definition to allow marriage of same-sex couples. Marriage in its current form, I fundamentally believe, is a key institution of our society and should not be altered. It has special status in our society and culture, and it has held that status for quite some time. On that basis, I am pleased to present this petition to the House on behalf my constituents who signed it.
