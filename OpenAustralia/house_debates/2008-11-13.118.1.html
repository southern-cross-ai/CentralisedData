        Governing is a serious business. Governing Australia is both a serious business and a distinct honour. Today in the parliament, however, the Rudd government trivialised the business of government and brought distinct dishonour upon itself. How and why did it do this? I am not sure why but I know how. Today in the House of Representatives, in our parliament, the Rudd government closed debate for members of the opposition on the

         and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008
        </a>
        and cognate bills, legislation that seeks to inject some $10.4 billion into the Australian economy. The federal opposition supports the legislation. However, while it supports it, it also believes its members have the right to speak on the bill and to express their views. I, as the federal member for Ryan, have not had that opportunity today in the House of Representatives. I have not had the opportunity today to express my views and my thoughts on behalf of the people of Ryan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister has described the global financial crisis, which requires the leadership and the goodwill of all governments and of all peoples, as a ‘rolling national security crisis’. On this basis, I believe that not only government members but, indeed, opposition members should have the right and the opportunity to speak at length and in depth on the legislation. The legislation is important because it has invested and injected across the country some $10.4 billion of taxpayers’ money. It has invested this in a whole range of stakeholders, from pensioners to people in the Ryan electorate who are receiving family tax benefits. Therefore, I think that as the member for Ryan I ought to comment on the taxpayers’ contribution to the global financial crisis and redressing and minimising its impact on the Australian economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd government was able to spend some $10.4 billion of taxpayers’ money because it had the surplus of the previous Howard-Costello government. Half of the surplus is now invested in the community—that is, some $10.4 billion of some $22 billion left by the previous Howard government. So, at the stroke of a pen, an enormous amount of money—in anybody’s language—has been injected into the Australian community. The people of Ryan will know that the federal opposition supports this action. I support it because it is seen to be in the interests of the Australian people. But, as the elected member for Ryan, I consider it my responsibility and indeed my duty to speak on behalf of the people that I represent, to speak on behalf of the people of the western suburbs of Brisbane, to give them my views and my concerns and to raise issues in relation to elements of the $10.4 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        We remain a parliamentary democracy. When I was a member of the Howard government, opportunities for members of the then government and the then opposition to speak were of fundamental importance to me, and when I felt that those opportunities were not presented to members of the then government and the then parliament I raised it with those in positions of leadership. I am a firm believer in the democratic process. I would not be in the parliament without the mechanism of democracy that we have in this country, a mechanism we ought to cherish.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a week when we celebrate and honour Australian men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the last 90 years in the name of freedom and under the Australian flag, I express my profound disappointment, as someone who cherishes the freedom and democracy of our country, at the government’s actions. As the son and as a grandson of people who wore the uniform in two theatres of war and in different times, in different generations and in different places, I express my deep disappointment at the decision of the government today in the House of Representatives to prevent members of the opposition and indeed some of their own members from speaking on this important bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the opposition is next in office I intend to maintain the position I have put. I believe that all members should have the opportunity to speak in debates on bills of profound importance, especially given that the world now confronts a global financial and economic crisis. Many commentators and experts say the world has not seen a crisis of such significance since the days of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
         Great Depression
        </a>
        . I feel strongly enough on this to say shame on the Rudd government, shame on the Prime Minister and shame on all those who share this view. I will inform the people of Ryan of my position.
