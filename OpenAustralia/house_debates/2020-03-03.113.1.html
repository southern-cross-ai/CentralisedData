       <p>
        Today I rise to speak on an industry which is having, and will continue to have, tremendous benefits for my electorate of Mallee, and indeed the entire country. It will also impact on a number of related industries that are forecast to grow rapidly and sustainably into the future. I speak of mineral sands mining. I have met with mineral sands companies on several occasions since coming to office, and I am fascinated by what is now achieved in this space.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is home to the largest mineral sands deposits in the world. Mineral sands are a group of minerals such as ilmenite, rutile, and zircon, commonly found together as course and fine-grain sands. Deposits often contain titanium, rare earth metals, and silicaâ€”the building blocks of modern life. With 32 per cent of the world's share of ilmenite resources and 62 per cent of rutile resources, Australia has an abundance of titanium mineral sands. Most of the world's titanium is used in the production of Ti02, a white pigment that is used in the production of paint, toothpaste and plastics. Titanium is also used in the production of titanium metal, which is used for medical implants, spectacles and the construction of space craft.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia also boasts a 68 per cent share of the world's zircon resources, which is incredibly important for the production of ceramic items, including tiles, bathroom fittings and air purification systems. Victoria has globally significant zircon and titanium resources, and there are two advanced projects underway in Mallee, as well as significant areas of exploration and project development. The first project is the Avonbank Heavy Mineral Sands project, which, subject to final approvals, is set to commence construction by 2022. This mine contains significant zircon deposits that will be extracted over the course of a 30-year period. A mine like this brings with it extraordinary employment opportunities for Horsham and the surrounding district, with several hundred jobs expected during the construction phase and 150 to 200 jobs during the operational stage over 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also the Donald Mineral Sands project, which is one of the largest deposits of zircon and titanium in the world, with a total mineral estimate of 5,710 million tonnes. This project has obtained a number of approvals, and the final stages of project development are expected to be completed in 2020. This project has the potential to deliver hundreds of jobs to our region, directly employing up to 150 people in the long term. This is a good news story for the township of Donald, who have lobbied me consistently about the need for more jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just two of many other exciting opportunities for mineral sands mining in Mallee. Mining licences have been granted for deposits near Ouyen, with many more exploration licences issued for areas south of Ouyen and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Another critical aspect of mineral sands mining is the industry's focus on mine site rehabilitation. By progressively rehabilitating the mined area, the area disturbance is minimised and the landscape is reformed more quickly. Approximately 97 per cent of mined material is returned to the mine site, so the land can be returned to its original state and returned to previous land use, such as agriculture. As I travel around the electorate of Mallee, I have seen firsthand rehabilitated mine sites around Ouyen, Wemen and Kulwin, and I have been told farmers are very happy with the way their land has been returned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mineral sands and the rare earth elements associated with them are used in many products that are becoming more and more essential to our daily lives, including cameras, audio systems, aircraft and satellites. And as many economies around the world begin to focus on emissions reduction and a lower carbon footprint, demand for rare earth elements is growing, because these minerals are crucial in the production of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels. I am proud to say Mallee is certainly pulling its weight in future readiness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am excited by the opportunities for economic growth and the diversification offered by mineral sands mining, and I look forward to working with relevant stakeholders to see Mallee become a world leader in the production of zircon and titanium minerals.
