       <p>
        The scourge of drug use and addiction problems in regional communities is well known, I'm sure, by members on both sides of the House. When people get to a position where they want to seek help, one of the troubling aspects for me as a local member is whether that help is available to them in their own communities. There is a shortage of residential drug rehabilitation beds in regional areas, perhaps right across Victoria, to such an extent that many in my community have had to go on long waiting lists to secure any help whatsoever.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'm very proud to say that my community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
         East Gippsland
        </a>
        , particularly around Bairnsdale, has taken action in its own right. The community has successfully initiated a major fundraising campaign and is now in a position where it has secured funding for the first stage of the Hope Restart Centre, which will be a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre to be built near Bairnsdale. The land has been secured through the goodwill of the local community. A lot of the money has come from the local community but also from some philanthropic sources, and the federal government has provided $3 million to allow this facility to be established.
       </p>
       <p>
        Groundworks have begun on the site. I've got to say that people are very excited about this opportunity, because we all understand that illicit drug use, particularly ice, can impact on any family. Right across our community we've seen the devastating impact it has had. Construction is due to start early next year and the centre is expected to receive its first clients in the second half of next year. We'll be working with people from across the Gippsland electorate, throughout East Gippsland and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe Valley
        </a>
        . The facility will be operated by Odyssey Victoria, a well-known provider of drug rehabilitation services. Progress on this much-needed facility has come about through the vision, the hard work, the determination and the commitment of several community leaders and volunteers led by Peter and Margaret Down. They are two, let's say, older residents in the community, with a great deal of experience. They acknowledge that themselves. In their alleged retirement, they have put their time to great use in developing this centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a great example of the community recognising a problem, seeking to develop a solution in partnership with the government and then getting on with the job of addressing what is a significant issue right throughout the region. I want to congratulate the Bairnsdale community today. I want to congratulate the businesses that have supported the Hope Restart Centre and to recognise the enormous effort that has already gone into it. This is what people want to see from governments. They want to see governments taking action on important issues like this and working with them to deliver great outcomes for local residents. I fear that more of these services will be required across the state. I look forward to working with other parts of my electorate to secure more services to protect our young people.
