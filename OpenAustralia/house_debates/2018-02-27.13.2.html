       <p>
        Labor welcomes the news today that the Oaky North coalminers lockout has ended. However, I would like to highlight reports exposing the hypocrisy of many members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . Let's just recap on their hypocrisy. These country miners have been to this place twice, and it wasn't until the second time that they came that their MPs even bothered to meet with them. They wouldn't even meet with them in their own electorates when they turned up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we have them turning around and saying that they support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        , but let's not forget what they said in this place less than six months agoâ€”in fact, the entire time that they have sat here. These members of parliament, these representatives, and their senior ministers have continued to attack the workers subject to the lockout. They have displayed in this place vile and, frankly, shocking behaviour. They have attacked the CFMEU, saying that they own the opposition. They have attacked members on this side who stood up to defend hardworking Australians who were locked out by their employer. And what have we seen today? Two hundred days after the lockout, we've seen these MPs, desperate to hold their own seats, thanking the CFMEU and thanking the workers for raising this issue.
