        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure. I refer to his answers today in which he has defended Victoria receiving under 10 per cent of federal infrastructure funding by mentioning funds that have been reallocated; argued Inland Rail would benefit Tasmania; defended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        receiving two per cent of funds in his portfolio by talking about his colleague's portfolio; and, on the northern roads program being not spent, he referred to the Nullarbor. Isn't the infrastructure minister simply not up to the job that he has been appointed to?

           Mr Speaker, members on the other side of the House are given a fair bit of licence, particularly the people's choice, but how is that a question to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Speaker?

            I ask the Leader of the House to pause. He's been on perilous ground in not referring to correct titles. I think I've heard enough of his point of order to rule on it. The question is completely in order. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.

            <p>
             I acknowledge the question because he's talking about people not being up to the job. I know he's got someone well and truly in mind who he believes is not up to the job. I think this is a great opportunity for the member for Grayndler to show his wares to the Australian people and to show his wares to the member for Maribyrnong. I know, when you're referring to 'not up to the job', that is actually a curriculum vitae for yourself. I know that you understand more than most that in equity and grant money we are spending vastly more than you did in infrastructure expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know you know better than most that you had no money on the table for the Inland Rail. And I know that you know more than most that you're going to take money off the table for dams, that you do not believe in infrastructure. But I believe in you, the member for Grayndler. I believe in the member for Grayndler! All of Australia believes in the member for Grayndler. We're in there rooting for the member for Grayndler. Good luck, old mate!
