         The member for Bass will pause. Members on both sides, the member for Bass is giving a constituency speech, which you are able to give without interruption. Can we start the member for Bass's speech again? Thank you.

          Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The social, cultural and economic value that volunteers bring to the local community needs to be heard and celebrated. In Tasmania alone, there are more than 300,000 volunteers, who give their time positively contributing to the wellbeing of other individuals and communities. The work is done quietly, tirelessly and without being asked for recognition. But it's great to see volunteers recognised for their service as part of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

          honours.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have the privilege of knowing the first recipient I'm highlighting today. It was an absolute joy to see Pamela Watkins recognised for her service to the community through a range of organisations. The list of her contributions is endless. As well as volunteering at the Old Umbrella Shop in Launceston, driving for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Red Cross
          </a>
          and being a blood donor for more than 40 years, Pamela has also taken on leadership roles with the northern Tasmanian branch of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commonwealth_Society" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Commonwealth Society
          </a>
          , the John Lewis Foundation and the Launceston Penguin Club. On top of all this, Pamela has also acted as a foster parent and exchange student host. Pamela, you are so deserving of this honour.

          Tasmania Volunteer of the Year, as part of the AFL's 150 year celebration in 2008, and she has been rightly recognised again for her decades of dedication to running the club's catering service. Tasma is a legend among the club and its community. Congratulations, Tasma.
         </p>
         <p>
          Life member of the Vietnam Veteran's Association and current state secretary and treasurer of the association's Launceston sub-branch, Malcolm Cash OAM has also been rightly awarded with the Order of Australia for his tireless work with Vietnam veterans. As part of the wonderful group of volunteers who make up the local sub-branch, Malcolm also spends every Tuesday mowing lawns and doing general home maintenance for elderly veterans and widows. Congratulations also to Mr Terence Bracken OAM, for recognition of his service to the motorsport industry; to Mr John Cornish OAM, for recognition of more than 50 years of volunteering for Scouts Tasmania; and to Mrs Betty Laverty, for service to music through pipe bands.
