       <p>
        Last week the nation was shocked to learn that in Werribee, in my electorate, a number of youths had been involved in a violent incident whereby a young and naive girl was attacked near the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_River" rel="nofollow">
         Werribee River
        </a>
        and the incident recorded on a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">
         DVD
        </a>
        which was then circulated to other young people. Of course this is an appalling act and the matter is now in the hands of the police. Whilst this is an appalling act, unfortunately other acts are now following which are also wrong. In particular, students of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Werribee Secondary College
        </a>
        , a school associated with some of these youths, have been the subject of attacksâ€”they have been spat at and had rocks thrown at them because they were wearing their school uniform. This is clearly inappropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Werribee Secondary College is a good school, well led by the principal, Steve Butyn. The staff are caring people and, overwhelmingly, the students of Werribee Secondary College are focused on excellence and success. Two wrongs do not make a right. Clearly Werribee Secondary College students have the right to go about their business as schoolchildren unharassed, and Werribee Secondary College has my full support at this very difficult time.
