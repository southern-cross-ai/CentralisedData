       <p>
        I rise again to discuss an important issue to many people living in my electorate, particularly in Craigieburn and the growing suburbs around Mickleham and Donnybrook. It is an issue that also impacts thousands of families right across Australia. These people know that the Turnbull government has broken a key migration promise—namely, with regard to introducing new temporary sponsored parent visas. Committed at the election, this measure was introduced as part of the 2017 budget but is yet to come into effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the last election, the Liberals followed Labor's policy and promised to introduce a new temporary parent visa. A large number of my constituents wish to be temporarily reunited with their parents who live overseas, especially if there are grandchildren who may not have had the chance to meet their grandparents. The government promised before the election that children would have to pay a bond for those important visas. But, alas, after the election, as we have come to expect, the government announced a non-refundable fee of $20,000 if families choose a 10-year option. This inept Turnbull government said one thing before the election and, once they won government—after misleading the Australian people—are doing something entirely different. A new cap of 15,000 visas per year was announced and they also announced that the new visa would be limited to one set of parents per household, forcing families to choose which parents they are able to reunite with. This is cruel and ridiculous. Our families deserve better than this dishonest government.
