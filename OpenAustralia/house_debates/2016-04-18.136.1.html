         No, it is not. We want to have a consideration in detail stage. It is quite reasonable to be able to have it. This legislation did not reach the parliament until today. It is being gagged already. People are entitled to give five-minute speeches on it.

           I am opposed to standing orders being suspended, and Labor is opposed to standing orders being suspended here. All we are saying is we should be allowed to put our case to the

                            Point of order, Mr Speaker. There has been a breach of the counting rules that have been carried by this House by the government whips. And this is a serious point of order, because the whips have put you in this position, Mr Speaker, and you have simply reported to the House what they have given you, but the numbers you have reported in terms of how many people have voted on the government side are not signed off on or agreed to in any way by the opposition whips. They are in direct contradiction to the rules that have been put in place by the Leader of the House.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            We did not like those rules when they were brought in, but the rules are: unless someone leaves their chair in an orderly wayâ€”they cannot do it in a disorderly way, which would put an obligation on you to consider naming them or removing them from the Houseâ€”during the period when the doors are open, they must come up and report to the whips. We know that only happened with the member for Kennedy, and yet the count has changed by three. That is not possible as an outcome under the rules we have.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Standing order 129 has been changed in this term of parliament. Standing order 129 now says:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            (c) Upon the doors being locked, the Speaker shall:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            (i) state the question to the House;
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            (ii) direct the Members voting â€˜Ayeâ€™ to move to the right side of the Chair, and the Members voting â€˜Noâ€™ to move to the left; and
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            (iii) appoint tellers for each side.
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            (d) No Member may move from his or her place from the commencement of the count until the result of that division is announced.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Unfortunately crossbench members, told to do so by the government whip, were put in an impossible position as well, where all that had to happen was that your ruling be followed. As a result of your ruling being ignored by the government whips, you have now been put in a situation where the count you have reported is in direct contradiction to the standing orders. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to confirm what I have described as having happened and, if so, to ask the government whips to adjust the count.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            We have had occasions under this new rule where some people on the government side have left the room altogether, but when it is a one-minute division they still get counted as though they were still here. That is not a particularly democratic procedure. But it is how the House has voted to work and how it therefore operates. What just happened there was in direct contradiction to the standing orders that we have. I simply ask that you ask the whips to advise you in accordance with the standing orders, because otherwise they have put you in an impossible situation under standing orders 129, 132 and 131(b)(i).

                                  It is very regular for members to come into the House and wave at the tellers and say: 'I have arrived' or 'I have changed my vote; I am moving to the other side'â€”usually the crossbenchers in fact from that part of the chamber. So this is a pathetic try-on. Obviously the record should reflect the votes in the House of Representatives, and clearly the members for Kennedy, Denison and Indi indicated that they wanted to vote with the government on this bill. That is how they voted and that is what should be recorded.

I was careful to indicate to the member for Braddon that I had moved. I also indicated to the member for Braddon that the member for Indi had moved. He clearly recognised and understood what I had brought to his attention. So I cannot see why there is any problem hereâ€”other than perhaps drawing attention to the fact that I am wearing the

I have not made a ruling; I have reported what the tellers have given me. I have heard the Manager of Opposition Business. But the tellers report the result to me as Speaker, and I report it to the House. That is quite clear. I have not made a ruling; I have reported the vote to the House. That is what I have done. The other point I would make is that how members report to the tellers is a matter for the tellers, not a matter for me. I have patiently listened. I am not going to take further points of order on this issue.

                                        Briefly. Standing order 132 is there to deal with exactly this situation. Because of the arguments that were happening in the course of the division it is true that members, in a disorderly way, moved from their seats, which none of us are allowed to do. But that did happen in front of us all. Standing order 132 simply allows the division to occur again. That standing order has been put there for exactly this reason. I would simply ask you, Mr Speaker, for it to be used. The reason is that we should not have a situation where the government whips can report whatever number they feel like and the House has no recourse. Standing order 132 allows us to do it again.

                                         ! Standing order 132 does provide for a division where there has been confusion. I think the sensible course of action is we will adopt standing order 132(a). I will call a division for four minutes and I would ask the tellers to do a full count. In accordance with standing order 132(a), the question is that the bill be now read a third time.
