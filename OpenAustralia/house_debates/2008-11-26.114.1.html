        I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House that a very prestigious water conservation award has been awarded to a very important institution in my electorate of Prospect—the Cumberland Country Golf Club. The Cumberland Country Golf Club is a very important institution in the Greystanes community. It is, in many respects, the social centre of Greystanes. We all know that golf courses have the potential to take a lot of water. But the Cumberland Country Golf Club has achieved the highest percentage reduction for 2008 at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Water" rel="nofollow">

        ’s ‘Every Drop Counts’ water efficiency awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have embarked on a number of very innovative and exciting projects to achieve this result, including: the trucking of treated water from sewerage treatment plants; using recycled ground and surface water from the nearby Boral Quarry to irrigate greens; halving the time of the irrigation system’s night-time cycle; retrofitting taps and toilets in the clubhouse; installing a 2,000-litre water tank used to increase the instances of hand watering; installing a 5,400-litre water tank, capturing rainwater from course buildings to be used in cleaning, saving approximately 29,000 litres of water just from washing the course’s golf carts; and, perhaps most significantly, constructing a water pipeline underground to pump ground and storm water from the site of the Boral Quarry at Prospect to the Cumberland golf club.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has taken a significant community collaboration involving Boral, the Dexus Property Group,

        ,

        , Sydney Water, the Department of Water and Energy, and

        </a>
        . All these measures have resulted in an 82 per cent reduction in water usage at Cumberland golf club, and I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate them for this award. In particular, I mention: the members of the water committee—Phil Burge, Ross Selleck, Fraser Stevenson, and Noel Ponton; the course superintendent, Mark Crittenden; past club president, Bob Angus; current president,

        ; and the general manager, Ian Cottle. This is something that the Greystanes community is very proud of and that I am very proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        My golf skills are nonexistent, despite many efforts, and I have now, I am happy to inform the House, retired from golf because I find it too frustrating given the amount of time I have to play, which is minimal. But I give my best wishes to the Cumberland golf club on their excellent efforts in saving water, which is a great result for the Greystanes community and of course the Sydney community as a whole.
