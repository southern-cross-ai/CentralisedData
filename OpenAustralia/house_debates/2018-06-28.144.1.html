       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to Peter William Thomson AO,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBE" rel="nofollow">
         CBE
        </a>
        , who sadly passed away this month. Peter lived in my electorate of Higgins and is of course remembered as a champion golfer. He was the first Australian to win the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Open" rel="nofollow">
         British Open
        </a>
        and went on to win a host of other titles during his career. Between 1954 and 1965, he won the British Open a staggering five times, including three times consecutively. Fellow World Golf Hall of Famer Gary Player described Peter as 'a true ambassador of the game and one having, without question, the greatest record of any Australian golfer'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian golfers often debate whether the title of Australia's greatest golfer belongs to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thomson" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Thomson
        </a>
        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Norman
        </a>
        . What did Peter think, though? Ever humble, he believed that the title in fact belonged to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrie_Webb" rel="nofollow">
         Karrie Webb
        </a>
        , who herself won seven major titles in her career. Peter instead made light of his obvious talent: 'It's just whacking a ball, for goodness sakes,' he once said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Golf always loomed large in Peter's life. He served as president of the Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA" rel="nofollow">
         PGA
        </a>
        for 32 years, designing and building courses in Australia and around the world. And his feats were much lauded. In 1979 he was made a Commander of the Order of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         British Empire
        </a>
        for his services to golf. In 2001 he became an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his contributions as a player and administrator. In 2016 he was named Australian golf's first 'Immortal'.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Peter was more than just a great sportsman. He was also a great champion of the Liberal Party and its values and considered
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Robert Menzies
        </a>
        one of his idols. Peter made a strong contribution to our party over the years, including an unsuccessful tilt for the state seat of Prahran in 1982. It was, of course, a very rare defeat in a lifetime of victories, although one that his wife, Mary—even though she shared his great passion for the Liberal Party—tells me she was not deeply unhappy about! Peter and Mary passed on their passion for our party to their son, Andrew.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrew was of course the member for Wentworth between 1995 and 2001, as well as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and then Minister for Sport and Tourism during the early years of the Howard government. Peter's life will be celebrated today in Melbourne, and I am deeply sorry that I cannot be there to celebrate with the family. I extend my sympathies to Mary; Peter's children, Deirdre, Andrew, Pan and Fiona; and their children. Vale, Peter Thomson, a great Australian. You will be forever remembered in our hearts.
