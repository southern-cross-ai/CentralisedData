        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister provide an update on the political situation in Zimbabwe?

        <p>
         I thank the member for her question. The government welcomes the agreement unveiled late yesterday Zimbabwe time by Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Mugabe to effect a power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Tsvangirai on becoming Prime Minister of his country in very, very difficult circumstances and against great odds. I am sure that sentiment is shared by the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government regard the peace arrangement as modest progress. Our preference, which again I am sure is also shared by the House, would have been for Mr Mugabe to walk off the stage, for him to go. The power-sharing agreement sees Mr Mugabe remain as President, Mr Tsvangirai as Prime Minister and a majority of cabinet ministers appointed from the Movement for

         party: some from Mr Tsvangirai’s faction, some from Mr Mutambara’s faction. The proof of the agreement will be in the implementation on the ground: whether we see real progress towards implementing the electoral and democratic will of the Zimbabwe people; whether we see respect for human rights; whether we see respect for the rule of law; and, importantly, whether we see the humanitarian, social and economic reconstruction of Zimbabwe.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some time, the Australian government has had sanctions very firmly imposed against Zimbabwe. These have had bipartisan ongoing support, both regarding travel arrangements for senior members of the regime and financial transactions. These sanctions will remain in place but will be kept under review pending the implementation of the agreement and progress made in Zimbabwe. Whilst having sanctions in place, the Australian government has continued to apply humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe. This has particularly applied to food and food assistance. In the last 12 months, we have seen nearly $10 million applied to humanitarian food assistance in Zimbabwe. Again, depending upon progress, we will look at whether it is possible for Australia to increase its humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe and whether capacity-building development assistance is also appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         From a very low base, this is modest progress. The proof will be in the actual implementation. We certainly wish that Mr Tsvangirai has a full and complete opportunity to advance the interests of his people, and the Australian government looks forward to dealing closely with Prime Minister Tsvangirai.
