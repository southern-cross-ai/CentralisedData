       <p>
        Yesterday I revealed a conspiracy being run by the Queensland Labor government in relation to my electorate of Herbert and the federal government. It will not surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the matter is road funding. We need a new port access road in Townsville. In fact, there is not one at the moment in the location where it is proposed that it be built. There is a $3 billion aluminium refinery project in the pipeline that Townsville may win and we need a port access road to service that project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state government have been working against the federal government and against the interests of my electorate by denying me any information on what the cost of this road might be. The Queensland state government are the design and construction authority. They cost the project. More than a year ago, in the interests of my community, I went to see the state Minister for Transport and Main Roads,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lucas" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Lucas
        </a>
        , who I think is quite a decent fellow. We get on very well. He promised that he would give me the information so that I could come to the federal government and fight for funds for that road. That information was not forthcoming, despite follow-ups on my part and despite the fact that our local state member, Lindy Nelson-Carr, is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Main Roads. Despite the fact that she is in Townsville and she understands the need for this project, I was given no information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, when the federal budget was brought down, there were no funds allocated for the port access road because we do not know what the cost will be. The Labor Party proceeded to give me a public flogging. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot not give me the information and then properly give me a public flogging. Yesterday I was able to release the letter from the minister, which has come in now, two weeks after the budget—that is the conspiracy—and I find that the cost of the road project has increased from $10 million five years ago to $190 million today, and will probably be more in the next few years.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the member for Mundingburra was asked about her position in not supporting the city, her spokesman said—she did not say—that I was running scared with the federal election due next year. I am not running scared. The people of Townsville will know which has been the delaying authority in this regard. They will know that I have, apparently wilfully, not been provided with information so that I can get the money included in the next budget. I am determined now to make sure that we do get the money for the port access road, the most needed road project in
