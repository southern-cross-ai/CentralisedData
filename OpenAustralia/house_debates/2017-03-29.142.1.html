       <p>
        Last Saturday morning, I attended three local events that confirmed with me how special and strong the community in Bennelong is. First up was the Ryde Little Athletics season finale fun day/age group trophy presentation. I had the honour of starting the parents 60-metre dash. After pulling the trigger, I joined in the race. I didn't catch; I didn't gain, but it was fun. The heart was pumping and the spirit was great. It is always exciting to see the parents do what they implore the children to do, and this is part of an initiative that we are trying to get the parents to do what the children do. It is a great organisation promoting positive activity amongst our young people. Club President David Sutherland and all of the organisers are community champions and should be congratulated. David introduced me to a special young athlete: Nathan Barbara. He is a double amputee but active in the club; an athlete who competes with prosthetic legs that he manages to walk and run with—a true example of a wonderful attitude to life; a real champion, and his parents are justly proud.

        club, who partnered with the athletics day, cementing a shared appreciation of the benefits of active recreation for young people. After my 60-metre dash, I then ran—well, I drove—to Eastwood to open and participate in the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong, the AAAB,

        football competition. Hugh Lee and the association are outstanding community ambassadors; real advocates for respect and harmony in our community. It was my absolute pleasure to support their initiative and to participate. I joined in the AAAB celebrities team—they said 'celebrities plus me'—and we got smashed by Medibank, who were semiprofessional. Despite my best efforts in defence, I think my best football days are behind me, and very few. Local teams supporting

The national anthem, both the verses, were sung beautifully by a local celebrity—who did not join our celebrities team!—Rosanna Gallo.

        Finally, after doing my best as the AAAB celebrities team's super sub, I departed for Ryde civic hall for an amazing Korean banquet lunch. It was the Korean Society of Senior Citizens Day celebration. I shared my meal with my neighbour from Reid, Craig Laundy—who was very gracious and drank beer, which he does very well—another great champion of this diverse community. President of the Korean Society of Sydney—
