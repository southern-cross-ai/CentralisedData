        All of these institutions are feeling the pressure from this federal government's cuts to the arts. I have spoken about it many times in this parliament. In most cases the state governments are being forced to pick up shortfalls, as is being done with the Australian National Academy of Music. Anyone who has been to

        The Australian National Memorial Theatre's Susan Thacore and I met education minister Birmingham to discuss funding cuts affecting diplomas in acting and ballet. Minister Birmingham advised us that the current model will not be revised for several months and that state governments skills tests need to be looked at, to see whether or not the artists who graduated from there can continue to get

        This institution obviously produces the highest quality drama workers, actors and ballet dancers. It is not the kind of institution that should have been cut back as a result of the minister's campaign against colleges that are producing people from invented courses at the last minute.
