        I rise today to speak about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        and the services that took place across my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        . This year's Remembrance Day marks the 93rd anniversary of the signing of the armistice which brought
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        to a close. In what was once known as the war to end all wars, more than 750,000 Australians served their country, with 155,000 paying the ultimate sacrifice. Remembrance Day provides Australians everywhere with the opportunity to commemorate the lives of those who did not come home from the front and time to reflect on both the harsh realities of war and the freedom we have today. With the passing of Mr Claude Stanley Choules on 4 May this year there are now no more remaining combat veterans from World War I. Mr Choules served in both the

        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and this year marks the centenary of the Royal Australian Navy.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, this Remembrance Day was also a sombre one, with the recent death of three Australian soldiers in Afghanistan on 29 October 2011 still fresh in our minds. Since Remembrance Day last year, 11 Australians have died in Afghanistan while serving their country. I would like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of all service personnel who have died in the past year. I would also like to express my thanks to all our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        personnel for their determination and their loyal service.

       <p>
        Remembrance Day this year fell upon a once-in-a-lifetime date: the 11th day of the 11th month of the 11th year of this century. In my electorate of McPherson there were ceremonies held at Currumbin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burleigh_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Burleigh Heads
        </a>
        , Mudgeeraba and Coolangatta to mark the occasion. I would like to express my congratulations and thanks to Ron Workman

        community an opportunity to remember the fallen. RSLs play an important role in local communities as hubs for social activity, facilitators of local events, supporters of other community organisations and torchbearers of our proud national history. They are undoubtedly part of the rich fabric of Australian culture and an essential part of any community. I am proud to say that, as always, the four RSLs in my electorate have continued to live up to this great reputation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude by thanking the veterans community for their service to our country and reaffirm my commitment to the McPherson veterans community that I will continue to ensure that they get a fair go.
