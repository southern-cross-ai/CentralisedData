        I want to pay tribute to three long-serving local councillors who retired at the recent Hume City Council elections. I want to begin with Councillor Drew Jessop, who served for 23 years. He was first elected in 1997. Drew is the first Labor councillor to represent the residents of Craigieburn and Micklehamâ€”two suburbs in my electorate that have seen massive growth and expansion in the last two decades. As a ward councillor, Drew made sure that amenities and services kept up with the pace of growth, especially in the areas of recreation, sporting facilities and parks. I give many thanks to Councillor Geoff Porter, who has proudly served the community of Broadmeadows, Campbellfield and Jacana for many years. Geoff had a very strong association with our local basketball community and has overseen the establishment of many sporting and cultural facilities. As a very popular councillor, he has a long tradition of volunteering. In his day job as a teacher at our local Catholic primary school,

        </a>
        , Geoff has overseen and assisted in the settlement process of the very large refugee community that came from Iraq and Syria and settled in Calwell. I have worked very closely with him on the issues of settlement and I am very grateful for his contribution and his help. Finally, Councillor Ann Potter, our longest-serving female councillor, is a champion for the community of Sunbury. This is a uniquely placed community and Ann leaves a wonderful legacy. I thank you all very much. We will miss you greatly.
