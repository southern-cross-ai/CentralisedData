        of People with Disability. My first association with disability was blindness—although, apart from cooking, it did not stop my grandma from doing just about everything else.

        But let me first describe a lesson when, as a rookie local councillor, I was referring to the disabled toilets in a particular development application. A long-term councillor stood and said: 'We're not speaking of disabled toilets. We want them to work. More importantly, we're discussing toilets for people with a disability.' That happened in 1995, and I recall it as if it were yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later I was approached in my fudge factory to take on an employee with a disability. Initially I could not imagine how a young deaf girl would manage. Crissy Suffolk started working with us and became an outstanding machine operator and process worker and a good friend. I even learned sign. She remained in the business for almost 20 years. Felicity Kriss was our next recruit. Being told that she could not count past 10, we devised a masking tape grid on the bench—four columns and 10 spaces for the 40 pieces that would go into the display box. She soon outgrew that counting tool. During her many years in the factory, she became one of the fastest packers and the best system checker and even prepared cartons for freight to send interstate. Ever since, I have held the belief that we should never, never doubt the potential of a single human being. I am truly inspired by the work of Slice of Life Australia in employing so many with disabilities. Young Matt has become a local hero. Congratulations, Karen Anstiss.

        This week I attended the 2014 National Disability Awards. I was inspired to meet so many who work in the field of service provision for those with a disability. My local business Jervis Bay Wild—who have done amazing work to make sure that wheelchair users can take the cruise to watch dolphins and whales in the bay just like everybody else—were nominated. While they did not receive the accolade of coming first, they are, to me, winners, being one of only 23 to reach the finals.

        By a lucky chance, I was sitting next to another group, Touched by Olivia. They did win, and they are already planning to come to Nowra with their creative, inclusive playgrounds. This brings the wonderful sequence of coincidence to the picture. Rebecca from that group has had discussions with a very passionate advocate for—would you believe?—toilets for people with a disability but, more important,

        . Annette Pham begins her emails with her name and the following message:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … I am the mother of Liam who is 12 years old and profoundly disabled. I am writing this letter to you to make you aware of a problem you possibly do not know even exists.
       </p>
       <p>
        At that time, I did not. Liam is a young man, not a boy anymore. Annette is a slightly built young woman but strong. Her dilemma, after travelling overseas, was that she needed to change Liam on the floor of a disability toilet. Before 3 December, I would encourage you to check the internet for these facilities—Changing Places toilets—around Australia. Perhaps we can all work together to help.
