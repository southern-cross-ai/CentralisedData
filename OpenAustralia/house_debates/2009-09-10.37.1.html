        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations, Education and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">
         Social Inclusion
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to revelations that hundreds of out of school hours care centres will be closed across Australia as the buildings that house them are demolished, with either no or inadequate contingency plans put in place for working families, to make their way for school halls. Will the minister intervene to ensure working families are not hit with greater costs and inconvenience?

         I thank the member for Indi for her question. The member for Indi I take it is referring to a media report today about some concern that some out of school hours care may be disrupted during the construction phase of

         say to the member for Indi that I travel to a lot of schools and I anticipate she probably travels to a number of childcare centres and early learning facilities and out of school hours care facilities, and what I think she would find when she does that is a lot of hard-working people. I certainly do that when I go to schools. When I talk to them about how they are going to manage construction at their school to support jobs today and to modernise their school facilities, something that they are enthusiastic about, they normally work very carefully through plans to keep activity going and to move children and teaching through facilities so that they can keep activity going whilst they do new construction. Of course, everybody would know who has ever been to a school that is building a new facility, or a hospital that is building a new facility or a university that is building a new facility, that this does require—

            As facilities are constructed, obviously plans are made to do everything that can be done to keep teaching going, after hours school care going and the like. It is inevitable when new facilities are being constructed that there will be some disruption and dust and inconvenience while the construction is in place. It has ever been so, it will ever be so. It has been so from the dawn of time and it will be so till the end of time. But responsible agencies, schools and schools authorities, are working through contingency arrangements. If the shadow minister has more information than simply revealed by today’s press report and if she can identify to me an individual out of hours school care service where she thinks inappropriate arrangements have been made during the building, then please bring those very specific details to me and I will be happy to work with her and anybody else interested in doing what we can to assist. This is normal, standard practice.

               I conclude by saying to the shadow minister and member for Indi that if she has specific information she wants to raise either in question time or with me, publicly or privately, I am obviously happy to work with her on individual concerns. But of course school authorities and individual school principals and teachers are people of goodwill and are making the best possible arrangements they can while these facilities are constructed.

               On the question of costs for working families, I await the day when we see fulsome congratulations from the shadow minister for the profound steps we took to better support working families with the costs of child care. I await that day.
