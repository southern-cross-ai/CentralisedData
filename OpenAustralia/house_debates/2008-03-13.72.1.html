       <p>
        I take this opportunity to reinforce my support for the Rudd government’s Teen Dental Plan, a health initiative that is a marvellous long-term policy to improve the dental health of young Australians. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you are undoubtedly aware, the Rudd government has announced that, under the Teen Dental Plan, over one million Australian teenagers—that is, those aged between 12 and 17 years—will receive financial assistance for a comprehensive dental check-up. It is part of a $510 million initiative that will run over three years and targets our kids to ensure they keep their teeth in good condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eligible families in my electorate of Lowe will be able to claim up to $150 towards the cost of an annual dental check-up for their teenage children. I know that the $150 will be welcomed by my constituents to pay for the cost of a comprehensive dental check-up, which normally comprises oral examination, clean, scale and X-ray, and which usually costs approximately $290.
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan is a targeted initiative. Unfortunately, dental services for teenagers have not been as readily available as those for most primary school children, who receive school dental services. The Teen Dental Plan is a fantastic initiative which will assist those families receiving family tax benefit A to provide their child with regular dental care. It will also serve to establish good dental hygiene practices in teenagers and prevent unnecessary pain from serious dental conditions later in life. My father-in-law sadly developed a decayed tooth, which ultimately led to quite a serious, cardiac problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sad but true, statistics reveal that one in three Australians avoid going to a dentist because of the cost. Worse, according to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        the dental health of Australian adults ranks second worst in the OECD, with a rapid deterioration observed in the teenage years. Further, according to health experts, there is a four-fold increase in dental decay between the ages of 12 and 21 and almost half of all teenagers have some signs of gum disease. It is a problem that is getting worse.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is quite alarming and that is why, today, I commend the Rudd government and the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        for taking action in an area of health that obviously needed urgent attention. The consequences of poor oral health are obvious. Neglect of oral hygiene leads to serious dental problems and ultimately to other more serious medical conditions, as I have referred to in the case of my father-in-law. Regular check-ups prevent cavities and other dental diseases and, further down the line, expensive dental procedures or even hospitalisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I applaud the investment in our health system. The benefits are for the long term, not just for the here and now. The Teen Dental Plan is an excellent preventative measure that will ensure young Australians are fit and healthy and ready to participate in an active life.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my seat of Lowe alone, this Teen Dental Plan will potentially assist some 9½ thousand teenagers. Dental health care is an issue many of my constituents raised as a matter of concern before the last election and I am happy to stand here today and to say that the Teen Dental Plan is another major election commitment that the Rudd government is now honouring and now delivering. It is part of the larger overhaul of the dental health system, with the re-establishment of the Commonwealth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_Health" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Program. It will be reintroduced to ensure that those who are in most need, those who find dental costs too expensive and simply cannot afford it, will get the dental assistance they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd government has looked at our dismal records and realised how important dental health is for the overall wellbeing of our nation. That is why the government will invest, as I have mentioned, $510 million in a Teen Dental Plan and $290 million to provide up to one million additional dental consultations to clear up waiting lists around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The $800 million commitment that the Rudd government is making in better dental health for all Australians should be commended and applauded.
