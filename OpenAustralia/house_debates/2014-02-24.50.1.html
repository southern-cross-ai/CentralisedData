       <p>
        I publicly acknowledge one of my community stalwarts who is genuinely a person who could claim a life well spent. So many people turned up to Robert George Loone's funeral at Deloraine in Northern Tasmania that a second community hall with video link had to be quickly set up near the Deloraine community complex to take the overflow. More than 900 people attended the service to mark the death of the long-time Meeandah Valley resident always known as Bob. Bob was born on 17 July 1940. He was brought up on a farm just out of Deloraine and attended the local school before leaving to work on his family dairy farm and for neighbours. He became a member of the Deloraine Junior Farmers, as Rural Youth was then known. It was the start of Bob Loone's service to his community that spanned more than 50 years. Bob also joined the Forest Hall Badminton Club and the local youth club after he started work.
       </p>
       <p>
        After he married Olive in 1961 the newlyweds moved down the road to Chudleigh, where Bob got a job with the department of agriculture as a herd recorder, started a fuel delivery business and built a service station and home. The fuel delivery business grew into a family supply store with Bob selling and delivering dairy supplies from the boot of his car. At the same time Bob served as secretary of the Chudleigh Agricultural and Horticultural Show. He played basketball for Chudleigh and he joined the Deloraine walking club. He was a lay preacher for 30 years, working specifically with young people: taking the country kids on bus outings and organising local group meetings. Bob's life has been well spent and no-one here would dispute that.
