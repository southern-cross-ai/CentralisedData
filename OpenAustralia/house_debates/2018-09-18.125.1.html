        for 25 years. Previously, Gary has held both the vice president and president roles and is a life member of the association. He was instrumental in a number of the upgrades at the current netball site. Gary is a bastion of netball in the Bayside community. Congratulations to Gary, his wife, Chris, and his three daughters, Chelsea, Kelly and Courtney.

        I would also like to acknowledge the SDNA executive for their ongoing commitment to sporting and community excellence. To Shane Peters, the president, Robin Batt, the vice president, Emma Collin, the secretary, Samantha Heldsinger, the treasurer, Wendy Wroblewski, a general member of the committee, and Graham Skull, also a general member of the committee, and Kris Pierce, who is a co-opted member and a superstar in the community, we honour your contribution to the fantastic electorate of Goldstein but more critically to the development of netball for young women and boys in part of our wonderful Goldstein community.
