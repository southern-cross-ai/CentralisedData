        My question is to the Prime Minister. What is the Australian government doing to strengthen aviation security?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. There can be no higher priority for a national government than the security of the country: protecting the country and protecting its citizens. National security has always been a priority of this government and those which have preceded it and those which will succeed it. For an island nation like Australia, aviation security is a particularly important part of our national security challenge. Australians love to travel and they rightly expect that the government will be doing all that they physically can to keep the travelling public safe.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
          National Security
         </a>
         Adviser to launch an immediate review of Australia’s aviation security arrangements. This review examined the implications of that attack for Australia’s aviation security arrangements in the field. This review has concluded and has finalised as a matter of urgency and provided advice to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          National Security Committee
         </a>
         of Cabinet. Based on those findings the government has today decided to implement several significant upgrades to Australia’s aviation security arrangements, which will have implications in part for the Australian travelling public.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today the government has announced a four-year $200 million strategy to boost Australia’s aviation security. It includes, firstly, increased passenger and baggage screening measures. These include body scanners, next generation multiview X-ray machines and bottle scanners capable of detecting liquid based explosives. The strategy includes, secondly, increased screening at regional airports, including explosives trace detection and metal detectors; thirdly, 50 per cent more firearms and explosives detection dogs at major international airports; fourthly, stronger international engagement and securing last ports of call to Australia; fifthly, a stronger air cargo supply chain through a number of screening measures and the introduction of a regulated shippers scheme; and, sixthly, enhanced systems to improve analysis of passenger information and to screen visa applicants for national security risks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia already has a world-class aviation security regime but today’s announcement is about how we enhance that regime even further for the future. This may mean it takes longer for passengers to pass through security, but the government believes that this inconvenience is a small price to pay for increased security. Even with these changes there is always a risk that the methods and tactics of terrorists will change and evolve. That is why the government will continue to review on a rolling basis the upgrade of airport security arrangements. No government can guarantee that it will stop every terrorist attack but we will continue to do everything reasonably within our power to prevent attacks in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will increase passenger and baggage screening measures, as I outlined before. There will be, as I noted before, an increase in the number of passengers who will be subject to explosives trace detection at our major international and domestic airports. The government will assist the industry to introduce as soon as practicable a range of new screening technologies at passenger screening points. These will include the latest body scanners, next generation multiview X-ray machines and bottle scanners capable of detecting liquid based explosives. Body scanners will be progressively operational as an additional screening measure at screening points servicing international departing passengers by early 2010. The government understands the privacy concerns some travellers may have with body-scanning technologies and will implement appropriate privacy and facilitation measures to mitigate these concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will also bring forward screening at a number of additional regional airports served by larger passenger turboprop aircraft. This will provide funding to regional airports to provide equipment for passenger and baggage screening, including explosive trace detection. We have also announced today measures concerning policing at airports, including the explosives detection dogs that I referred to earlier, and the strengthening of international cooperation, particularly in terms of those countries of origin or so-called last ports of call to Australia. The initiatives announced in relation to the air cargo supply chain are also important given its vital link to the overall security fabric of our airports. Finally, there is enhanced data analysis. If there is one thing which has emerged from the events in the United States on 25 December it is that we should make sure that when data is in the system it is properly collated, coordinated and passed to action points within the security system. For those reasons we have also taken further measures in this respect as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recent events have shown that terrorists and terrorist organisations are now trying new techniques and strategies in their efforts to target innocent people. Although no single measure can prevent a terrorist attack, new technologies, better training and greater cooperation with other governments can help us stay one step ahead of terrorist organisations. It is vital that we remain vigilant and take those steps that are necessary to protect Australian citizens at home and abroad.
