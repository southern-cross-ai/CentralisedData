       <p>
        I rise today on what is set to be the last parliamentary sitting day for a number of weeks to speak briefly about what for many is one of the most significant festivals of the year, particularly for the many Christian believers in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . I speak, of course, about Easter, an opportunity for all of us to pursue and reflect on our shared values, the love that we share for our family and friends, the challenges before us and the significance of the events that happened around 2,000 years ago.

        and beyond are putting together a whole range of activities for Central Coast residents as they proclaim the message of grace and hope this Easter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there are also many other great events happening across the coast, including four days of free activities being run by

        festival from 9 am to 3 pm, including market stalls, entertainment, food stalls, a funfair and more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, many families from around the coast are visiting, and I'd like to take this opportunity to encourage anyone who doesn't yet have plans for the Easter long weekend to join us on the Central Coast. We have beautiful beaches from the peninsula over to Killcare and up to Wamberal. We have incredible bushwalks, and there's plenty of fantastic food and entertainment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The appeal of the Central Coast is backed up by the latest tourism figures. In the year to December 2017, more than 1.7 million domestic visitors visited the Central Coast according to new figures released today through the National Visitor Survey. The figures show a growth of 15 per cent over the last three years. It's the same trend with international visitors as well, with data that we released last week showing 63,000 international visitors flocked to the Central Coast in the same period. That's an increase of 32 per cent, while spending went up by 91 per cent year on year. I suspect that this Easter long weekend will be no different, with so many expected to come to the Central Coast to enjoy their break.
       </p>

        Finally, if you are travelling on the roads this Easter, please take extra care. Double demerit points are in force in

        , and it's really worth ensuring that you slow down and drive safely for all our sakes. Have a safe, refreshing and happy Easter, and enjoy chocolate in moderation if you can.
