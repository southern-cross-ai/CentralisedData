        During the autumn recess, I had the privilege of attending the Karoonda Farm Fair, not for the first time but certainly for the first time since my election as the federal member. This year saw the Karoonda Farm Fair committee celebrate the 30th anniversary of this event. I congratulate President Ian Wood and manager

        and other members of their hardworking committee on another successful fair. This fair would not be the success it is without the hardworking and dedicated members of the Karoonda District Agricultural Bureau and the Ettrick Agricultural Bureau and the support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Council" rel="nofollow">
         District Council
        </a>
        of Karoonda East Murray and community volunteers.

        The Karoonda Farm Fair is an annual two-day event, showcasing local, state and interstate farming and general interest products, services and events based at Karoonda in the heart of the Murraylands. The farm fair enjoys a broad visitor base from across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        as well as from interstate. With over 350 exhibitors each year, the field days attract a significant crowd and provide a major boost to the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Besides having the opportunity to discuss matters of concern with a great line-up of exhibitors and visitors, I also enjoyed the many interesting entertainment events at the field daysâ€”namely, the Karoonda State Yard Dog Championship, a yesteryear display, children's entertainment, a Healthy Murraylands cooking demonstration and, my personal favourite, the speed and sports shearing event. I always marvel at these athletes of industry, not least because the last time I sheared a sheep it fell asleep. Whilst I cannot emulate their efforts I can support their cause, which is raising money for breast cancer.
