       <p>
        It's fantastic to be in a position to see a major event like the Rotary Far North Queensland Field Day going ahead as planned. The past year has been like no other. We have faced many challenges and continue to do so, but together as a community we've met those challenges head-on. Agriculture has always been a major pillar of our economy, especially up in my neck of the woods. It's played a critical role in our national recovery from this pandemic and will continue to play a critical role moving forward. That's why I have no doubt that next week's Rotary Far North Queensland Field Day is shaping up to be the biggest and best yet. The event will see up to 600 exhibitors, and an anticipated 10,000 people will pass through the gate each day over the course of the three-day event. This will result in a much-needed boost to the economy of our entire region. I want to acknowledge the work of the Atherton and Mareeba Rotary Clubs in making this event the success it has always been and will continue to be in the years to come. However, this event wouldn't be possible without the hard work and dedication of the amazing people behind the scenes who volunteer their time to ensure that the event is a success. To those people and the so many others who have been working so hard to help shape this magnificent event, I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation for their effort. It's greatly appreciated, and I have no doubt the 2021 Rotary Far North Queensland Field Day is going to be an outstanding success.
