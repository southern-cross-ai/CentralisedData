        My question is to the Prime Minister. This government has underspent on its infrastructure announcements by an average of $1.2 billion every year for the eight long years that it's been in office. How can Australians have any confidence it will deliver on the announcements made in this year's budget?

                The federal government pays states and territories upon the completion of milestones. When a state or territory gets the allocation, gets the commitment by the Commonwealth, they do the contracting, they do the tendering, they run the project, and, when a certain amount of cement is put down, when a depth of a hole is built, when a pier is put up, we pay on milestones. So, if there's weather or if there's some other event or, indeed, if a state just can't get on and do the job required then the cheque doesn't get paid. But rest assured, Member for Ballarat, that money, as you claim might be underspent, still goes into the overall budget for infrastructure, and it does get spent upon the completion of that job. That's why we are getting on—

Did I say in my previous answer—I think I did—an additional 30,000 tonight in the budget. We're getting on and we're spending the money that's required. We also do it based on state priorities—

                  My question is to the Prime Minister. One in three of Australia's biggest corporations pays no tax, and, while the rest of the country was hit hard during the pandemic, Australian billionaires' wealth increased by a third, with some doubling their wealth. Prime Minister, isn't it time to make the billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share so that we can make critical investments like getting dental into Medicare? We're a wealthy country, but many people are still struggling. So, in tonight's budget, will you listen to the Greens and put in place a six per cent tax on billionaires' wealth—

                     I've got a tip for the member for Melbourne: I won't be listening to the Greens, and neither will the Treasurer or the Australian people, who value their jobs and value the strength of the economy, which is what actually pays for essential services. This seems to be something that escapes the member for Melbourne, the Greens and, I expect, many who sit on their side. It is the strong economy—businesses going out and employing people, investing, creating jobs and creating the opportunities that drive an economy—that pays for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, pays for aged care, pays for mental healthcare support and pays for all of the services. It pays for the pension. It pays for disability support. A strong economy is what achieves that. That is why tonight you will see a budget that guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on, because it is a comprehensive further plan to secure the economic recovery of this country. That economic recovery, compared to what is happening around the world at the moment, is quite striking. There are few developed countries in the world that can say that there are more people employed today than there were before the pandemic hit. That is a great achievement of Australians—Australians going out there and working hard, running businesses and putting Australians in work so they can pay taxes and ensure that the government can support the essential services that Australians rely on.

                     We are the party of lower taxes, and I'll tell you why that is. We are the party of lower taxes because we believe that Australians should keep more of what they earn. We believe that a dollar kept in the hands of an Australian family is better than a dollar kept in the hands of the government. That's what we believe. We believe that. That's why we have put speed limits on taxation in this country, which the Labor Party has opposed at two successive elections. It is a speed limit on taxes that we apply on ourselves, because we know that higher taxes actually strike out the enterprise and initiative of Australians who are working hard for their own families in their own communities. We will remain the party of lower taxes. Those opposite are the ones that, on every occasion, know how to start spending. They never know how to stop. They're the party that said that we should keep JobKeeper in place forever. They knew it had to be introduced, but they didn't know how to end it. That was not the responsible decision that they were prepared to support. We will remain the party of responsible investment of taxpayers' money, and we will forever be the party of lower taxes.
