        I have just returned this morning from the most amazing behind-the-scenes tour of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library" rel="nofollow">
         National Library
        </a>
        . The National Library is an integral part of our national identity and heritage, and it is crucial that we ensure it is properly maintained and resourced, which is why I rise to speak today about Trove, the National Library's premier program that digitises and provides free access to a treasure trove of artefacts, curiosities and stories from Australia's cultural, community and research institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital that people who cannot access libraries and institutions in person are able to access these collections online. Trove has become a vital part of Australia's cultural infrastructure, with approximately 20 million visits per year. It's enabled users from across Australia and the globe to access newspapers, gazettes, magazines, images, maps, artefacts, reports, diaries, letters, books, archives, music, video, audio material and, importantly, archived websites that would otherwise be out of reach.

         Lyndall Ryan
        </a>
        used Trove to gather major sources of evidence for her project to create a digital map of colonial frontier massacre sites across Australia. Professor Ryan's team accessed more than 90 newspapers on Trove from across Australia, and without this kind of information to follow up the project would not have succeeded. Trove is a national treasure, a vital educational resource and crucial for the preservation of Australia's history, and it must be properly maintained and resourced for future generations.

        I am delighted to rise today to acknowledge some of the incredible Novocastrians who were recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        honours this year. Mrs Dorothy Ebbott was awarded the Order of Australia medal for exceptional service to the Newcastle and Hunter District Historical Society and commitment to the preservation of our rich local history. Professor Maralyn Foureur received her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

Mr Patrick Slattery was awarded an OAM for his decade of service to the Newcastle community through a range of roles. Mr Andrew Traill was awarded an OAM for his exceptional service to Newcastle, as was Ms Tanya Wilks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Novocastrians continue to astound me. I congratulate them all for their exceptional service.
