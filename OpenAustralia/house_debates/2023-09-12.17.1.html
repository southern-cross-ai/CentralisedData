        When Labor first introduced the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation to this parliament in February, it didn't guarantee a cent of funding for public and affordable housing. As a result of pressure from the Greens and as a result of pushing and fighting, there is now $3 billion of direct investment going into public and community housing.

Instead, we held firm and got $3 billion of direct investment in public and community housing. There are now tens of thousands of people who will get to move into a public and community home because the Greens pushed back on a plan that didn't guarantee a cent in funding for public and community housing.

Every time someone gets evicted because they can't afford the rent, that's Labor's fault. My promise to renters is that we will not stop fighting. We will not stop fighting, no matter how much pushback we get, until we're standing here celebrating a freeze and cap on rent increases and changing millions of people'sâ€”
