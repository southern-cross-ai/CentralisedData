        On Wednesday 31 August, the Robertson team and I hosted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Jobs and Skills Forum. This forum brought together the region's leaders and representatives from areas of business, unions, government, industry and education in order to discuss the challenges that face the labour market and the issues that face jobs and skills on the Central Coast. This forum corresponded with the Albanese Labor government's national Jobs and Skills Summit, which concluded at the end of last week. That summit similarly heard from businesses, unions, industry and government leaders and representatives from across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Central Coast Jobs and Skills Forum took place in Gosford, the major city of our region. It was an incredibly productive meeting where stakeholders discussed the major challenges of our region and possible solutions to overcome these challenges. Some key points and information about the Central Coast labour market conveyed at the forum included that, on the Central Coast, according to the latest data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        , the region's largest employer is health care and social assistance, representing approximately 18 per cent of the total employed persons in the region. This was followed by retail trade; construction; education and training; professional, scientific and technical services; and manufacturing, thus showcasing the diverse industry across our magnificent region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within these key employment categories, women are represented in greater numbers in comparison to men in health and social assistance sectors and within education and training. However, within manufacturing and construction there are a greater number of males. Further, the business community was well represented at our jobs and skills forum. The small and medium-sized business community is a major employer on the Central Coast and an engine room of our local economy. The data states that construction represents the highest number of businesses registered, at just over 6,000; followed by professional, scientific and technical services, at 3,200; and rental, hiring and real estate services, at 2,300. These categories represent the greatest number of businesses in my region of the Central Coast. Also of note is that 15 per cent of the total employed population on the Central Coast hold multiple jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education was also a major factor at our jobs and skills forum, as it is right across Australia. By way of background, just over 41 per cent of the Central Coast population does not have any post-high-school qualification, and only 14 per cent hold a bachelor's degree. Further, 24 per cent of Central Coast residents hold a vocational qualification. What these figures demonstrated at the forum and demonstrate to us tonight is that these are all areas that all levels of government can work together to address and improve employment and education outcomes. This was exactly the purpose of the Central Coast Jobs and Skills Forum: to identify the challenges and the opportunities in our region, and to work on the solutions to make the Central Coast stronger and better prepared for the future. This is the better future that the Australian public voted for at the 2022 federal election.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government is determined to ensure Australians are never held back and never left behind, and I am proud to be part of a government that has already demonstrated its commitment to incentivising education and training that will ensure more Australians can achieve success and realise their full potential. Our government, our Labor government, recently announced, following the national Jobs and Skills Summit, that it will provide up to 180,000 fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        positions across Australia. An important message that also came out of the Central Coast Jobs and Skills Forum was the cost of education and barriers to education. This will incentivise Australians to undertake courses in areas of shortage and areas of national priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, the Central Coast Jobs and Skills Forum identified a range of other issues that are inhibiting the labour market in our region. These are a few of the key issues discussed. A common theme was that there needed to be a better relationship between education and industry. Many businesses mentioned that they had apprenticeships available yet could not secure employees for these positions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that is removing the barriers to vocational education by ensuring younger workers and older workers have access to fee-free TAFE courses, especially in areas of skill shortage and national priority. TAFE has always been a place to train. TAFE has always been a place to retrain. And, when financial barriers are removed, this allows equity and this allows access. These are the principles that underpin and have guided the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        since its inception and that now guide the Albanese government. The government will also invest just over $480 million to deliver up to 20,000 extra university places, making it easier for Australians to find a spot at university and to get a job. These measures will help address the skill shortages in vital industries across the country and will mean stronger connections between education sectors and industry sectors. This is all part of a comprehensive education package that will remedy a decade of neglect by the former government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another big issue that was raised at our Central Coast Jobs and Skills Forum was road infrastructure. Our local road infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. When these discussions were had at the forum, comparisons were made to nearby cities like Sydney, and many stakeholders mentioned that it takes longer for residents to get from point A to point B on the Central Coast than it takes to get from Sydney to Newcastle. This is holding back the region's prosperity. To ensure that the Central Coast can attract more business and more industry, we need to support the infrastructure that will promote business and industry growth, and support the workers travelling to and from their place of employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to be part of a government that will take action to improve the infrastructure on the Central Coast by investing in key transport routes, including in Kincumber with the Avoca Drive upgrade and our $40 million local roads package. Of course, more can always be done to improve infrastructure and transport options. This will be a priority of mine over this term of government, working with the Albanese local government, the state government in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and the local government in the Central Coast region to achieve these outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The city of Gosford represents a huge opportunity for job creation and economic growth. Many stakeholders from the forum understood that Gosford needs greater investment to ensure it becomes a liveable city and attracts people to the destination for business, education and training, tourism, nightlife and the arts. We need to finally unlock the potential of the Gosford waterfront and imagine a place that welcomes everyone and showcases the magnificence of the natural beauty of the surrounding area. We must ensure we provide support for the arts with links to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        community and a history of the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Central Coast jobs and skills forum was a complete success. We brought together business, unions and government; we identified challenges, opportunities and solutions that can solve many of the issues holding the Central Coast back while maximising our region's strengths. The information provided at our forum will be submitted to the federal government's employment white paper. I encourage Central Coast residents to get in touch with my office if they would like to make a submission. I want to thank each and every participant at the Central Coast jobs and skills forum. Your contributions on that day and into the future will help shape a better future for the Central Coast region.
