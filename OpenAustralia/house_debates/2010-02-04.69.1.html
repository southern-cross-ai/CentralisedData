        My question is to the Prime Minister about his great big new tax and his proposal to provide fixed levels of compensation based on average price increases, which do not take into account the higher prices paid by regional families for electricity, water, food, groceries, fuel and other essentials. Why does the compensation envisaged overlook the increased costs faced by regional Australian families, particularly those who need to rely on higher costs for heating and cooling their homes in places like Darwin and Launceston?

         I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. I go first of all to the preface to his question about big taxes.

         just remind him that the one he is putting forward is three times more expensive than what the government has put forward. Furthermore the opposition’s scheme will cost more than $1,000 per household by 2020 on their current numbers, and can I say to those opposite—

                         say in response to the Leader of the National Party’s question, the first part of which went to the question of big taxes, I simply, as a matter of truth, assert that their proposal costs the taxpayer more than $10 billion—that is what they say. Our proposal costs the taxpayer $3.3 billion. On a matter of fact theirs is three times the cost of the government’s plan.

                           Order! There is no point of order. I hope that the Leader of the National Party, on reflection, will realise that, whether it is on his written script or not, he added words about a description of a tax that have been used during this week. It might have assisted me if I had ruled that part of the question out of order. It is something that I am now considering to make it easier for me as the chair. I indicate to some people that, if they consider the allowances that are made on questions which are outside of the standing orders, they might reflect upon the way they behave in other aspects of question time.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I am in a position where I am trying to implement standing orders that I am on the record as describing in this place, both as Speaker and before being Speaker, as not being a level playing field. If we want to rule out argument and other matter in questions, I am happy to do that. But I think that people should reflect upon what the consequence would be of that. The Prime Minister has the call, he is responding to the question, and I hope that he will be heard in silence.

                              Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point is relevance. I note from the

                              that of course you cannot compel ministers to answer questions. However, you can note that, as the Prime Minister has decided not to answer the question, you might invite him to sit down and admit he will not answer it.

                               I think I have ruled on this aspect when raised by the Leader of the National Party. The Prime Minister is responding to the totality of the question. It may not have been what the Leader of the National Party intended as the main point of his question, but the Prime Minister is responding.

                               <p>
                                If you look at those numbers and how they flow out over the decade, of course, they add up to something equivalent to, or perhaps larger than, $1,000 per family as a taxation burden which would flow from the proposal put forward by the opposition. Of course, the alternative in terms of funding it lies in cutting services, and the Leader of the Opposition refused to rule out cuts to defence and refused to rule out cuts to hospitals and therefore, of course, we have had nothing either on the tax side or the spend side to clarify the whole nature of the big tax position and topic which the Leader of the National Party referred to before.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                My next point on the big tax question is about whether the opposition are serious about the abatement task, which is reducing carbon pollution. Today, we have expert analysis from the Department of
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                                 Climate Change
                                </a>
                                that the overall impact of the scheme put forward by those opposite is to bring out 40 million tonnes reduction in overall carbon pollution. Of course, the target is 138 million tonnes if we are to be serious about a five per cent reduction overall. So, as I have said in response to an earlier question, if they are only going to do 40 million tonnes reduction, that actually results over time in a 13 per cent increase in the overall emissions in the economy. So they end up paying more in their scheme and we still push out more carbon pollution into the future. It does not add up.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                But, if they were actually serious about the target of 138 million tonnes worth of greenhouse gas emissions, I am also advised that in fact the tax burden goes beyond $10 billion into multiples beyond that. So I just say to those opposite: if you are putting forward a scheme which does less and costs more you should think very long and hard before you ask questions about other schemes.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Now, on the question of compensation which the Leader of the National Party also referred to, I say to the Leader of the National Party that the compensation regime which we have put forward has been clear on the public record for a long time. It applies to different income categories and it has been the subject of multiple questions in this place. In terms of how the scheme is reviewed over time, once the scheme commences household assistance would continue into the future. Secondly, because these assistance payments are indexed to the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                                 CPI
                                </a>
                                , assistance will automatically increase in line with increasing carbon prices that affect household costs.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                I also say that before the scheme commences and indexation begins the government is committed to adjusting the initial level of household assistance if the cost of living impacts are higher than expected. Finally, I say to the Leader of the National Party that the government will also annually review in the budget context the adequacy of assistance to all households, noting that these payments are already automatically increased.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                These, and the government’s position on how we approach indexation, are clear on the public record. That is the response to how we would look at future levels of assistance across the country.
