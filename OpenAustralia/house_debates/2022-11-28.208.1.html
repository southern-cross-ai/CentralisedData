       <p>
        As the parliament comes to an end, with the final week of the sitting period, I just want to get to my feet and wish a very merry Christmas to everyone, particularly those amazing people in my electorate who make our community such a beautiful place to live, including our Rotarians, our Lions, our service organisation people and our hospital auxiliary boardsâ€”people who give their time freely and do so without seeking any accolade. They just want to serve their community and their fellow man.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge, in anticipation, our emergency response teams. We've had, in our electorate, seven floods in 12 years. So far, to date, from a weather perspective, we have missed the type of carnage that we are used to. I just want to acknowledge our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        personnel, our rural firefighters, our police officers and our ambulance personnel, who put their lives aside and get to the front line when it's needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge and pay credit to our senior graduating students who are finishing up this year. I was privileged to get to a number of their graduation ceremonies and I look forward to watching the journey they take in the next chapters of their life books. I want to acknowledge our schoolteachers, our staff and even our cleaners at our schools. Without them, we would be poorer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge my partner, Christine. In the spirit of forgiveness, I want to wish all the Labor Party colleagues on the other side a very merry Christmas. And, as a sign of absolute Christmas spirit, merry Christmas to the crossbench as well!
