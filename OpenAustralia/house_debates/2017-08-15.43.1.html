        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Minister, we've had many discussions on the importance of improving the train service in north-east Victoria. I acknowledge the $100 million in the May budget and the $40 million in June and your genuine intent to try and restore confidence in this poor service. Can you tell the House today—could you please outline the scope of the works—how will the money be spent and on what? What is the timeline for delivery? And, most importantly, how will the communities of north-east Victoria, particularly Indi, be kept in touch about these decisions and know what the intentions of both the

        </a>
        and the government are in this regard?

         What a contrast! Those opposite are more interested in digging up dirt than actually moving dirt and building the roads and the railways—the infrastructure that Indi needs. So I thank the member for Indi for her question. It's a constructive question. I thank her for her positive approach to this important infrastructure project. We are working with the people of Indi to deliver the infrastructure that her community wants and deserves, both rail and local roads. She understands that all the members on this side of the House recognise that when you build good infrastructure you can change people's lives and save people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Indi has been actively engaged on the north-east rail project for many months. I was very pleased to announce with the Prime Minister that the Turnbull-Joyce government would be providing $1.57 billion for a regional rail package, and it was welcomed by the members for Murray, Corangamite, Wannon, Farrer and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
          McMillan
         </a>
         . They are all very happy with this investment, because they recognise that it's going to make a real difference in their communities. As the member for Indi rightly points out, the coalition has committed to a $140 million rail package in her electorate. It will see substantial upgrades to the north-east line, which has been plagued by poor service for many years now. Her community deserves better, and we are endeavouring to deliver that in partnership with the local community.
        </p>
        <p>
         To answer the member's question more specifically, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTC" rel="nofollow">
          ARTC
         </a>
         and the regional rail provider, V/Line, are currently assessing the priorities for the north-east line and will report back to the respective state and federal departments in the weeks ahead—hopefully, by the end of this month. It's the community's expectation that the scope of works will focus on ride quality. It will also focus on increasing the reliability and frequency of service into the north-east. Once ARTC and V/Line have reported to their respective departments, I will be having further discussions with the Victorian minister, who has engaged constructively on this issue, and, when we are working together, on how we implement that scope of works and firm up the detailed time frames that the member for Indi has asked me about. I expect that passengers on the north-east line will start seeing benefits from later on this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the member's question on consultation, there will be opportunities for discussions with the community and the respective rail operators around the scope of works. The member for Indi will, of course, be invited to participate and engage in this process. As the member for Indi knows, another key factor in this process is involving the Victorian government on the issue of rolling stock. I'm sure the member for Indi will continue her lobbying efforts with Premier Daniel Andrews to keep his promise to the Indi community and purchase the new trains that are required. She well understands that we can upgrade the line, but if we are still using rolling stock which is 40 and 50 years old the improvements will be very minimal. It's about ride quality. It's about improving the frequency and the reliability of the service, which is a critical element for the community. So these projects, which were announced by the Prime Minister and me, are part of us working together with the community to deliver the infrastructure we need.
