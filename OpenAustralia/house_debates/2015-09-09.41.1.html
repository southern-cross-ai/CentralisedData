       <p>
        I am delighted to rise today to congratulate and thank the great team of locals who put together the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        -Mooloolaba marathon recently. There is something quite unique about this event, because it is not just a running event; it is actually about charity. I have often risen in this place and talked about the generosity of the Sunshine Coast community. With this event not only do you get some fitness but also every dollar that is raised goes to charity. The biggest beneficiary is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald McDonald House
        </a>
        . Like most members of this House, I have seen many examples of families—whose lives have been shattered when a young person has cancer or has a catastrophic injury—who, at a moment's notice, have had to go to Ronald McDonald House.
       </p>
       <p>
        This event raised over $500,000. The events ranged from 42 kilometres down to two kilometres. I am pleased to inform the House that, with my grandson on my shoulders, I pounded out every last metre of those two kilometres. It was a tremendous effort by me! I congratulate Gary and Greg, the two local franchisees of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The marathon was their brainchild. They not only put their money, time and effort into it but were also down there on the street at six o'clock on Wednesday morning and Thursday morning making sure that the families who came together on the Alexandra Headlands spit had a wonderful time and experienced what it is to be a Sunshine Coaster, to get active and to give to their charities.
