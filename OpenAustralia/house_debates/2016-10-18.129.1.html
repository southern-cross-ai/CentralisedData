       <p>
        I rise today to celebrate the opening of Hummingbird House in Brisbane. I was humbled to represent Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and health minister

        recently at the opening of Queensland's first children's hospice to meet some of the families and the children who will ultimately benefit from this amazing facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was families like Mark and Fiona Engwirda, who have loved and lost a child to life-limiting conditions, who understood the need for a children's hospice in Queensland. Their daughter, Kate, suffered from a weak heart and microcephaly, which caused severe epilepsy and respiratory difficulties. At only nine months old Kate had open heart surgery to fix her heart condition, but the heart did not repair the way doctors had hoped. The Engwirda family did all they could to make the most of every moment with Kate, while ensuring she received the 24-hour care she required for the next 15 months. The family travelled interstate to a purpose-built facility to get respite. 'We were in a hospice in

        </a>
        when we kissed Kate, told her we loved her, and said goodbye,' they said. They had travelled over 1,000 kilometres to that hospice, because there was nowhere for them to go in Queensland. Hummingbird House will change that.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is stories like the Engwirdas' that led to the creation of Hummingbird House. I want to sincerely thank and congratulate Paul and Gabrielle Quilliam, co-founders of Hummingbird House, and everyone who was involved in making this inspiring project a reality. Too often, for too many, living past childhood or even school or university will never be a reality. Hummingbird House will care for children from right across Queensland. This government has contributed $5.5 million over six years to the establishment and operation of Hummingbird House, which will provide essential end-of-life care and support for up to 3,700 children and their families in Queensland. This is a reflection of this government's commitment to implementing initiatives which improve access to high-quality palliative care for all Australians, including children, as they require it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul and Gabrielle Quilliam's efforts, in partnership with Wesley Mission Queensland, have resulted in a world-class facility which will greatly improve the quality of life for terminally ill children and their families. It is a tribute to their passion and their vision, as well as to the commitment and strength of their supporters and partners, that they have been able to secure the personal support of not just one, but two prime ministers. I want to pay tribute to the member for Warringah's personal commitment and contribution to this project, modelling Hummingbird House on Bear Cottage, a children's hospice in his own electorate. I also want to thank and acknowledge the hard work and dedication to this project of the member for Petrie, Luke Howarth, and the member for Dickson,
