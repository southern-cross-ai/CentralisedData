        It's a wonderful time in the parliamentary cycle, because we are hearing so many wonderful maiden speeches—from across the aisle included. It makes one reflect on one's own maiden speech—and many of the ones we're hearing talk about their individual electorates. I recall only three years ago speaking about my electorate of Fairfax on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        and making the point that my vision—and it remains my vision—is for the Sunshine Coast to be the healthiest place on earth with the healthiest environment, the healthiest community, the healthiest economy, the healthiest relationships, the healthiest way of life and the healthiest civil society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within that vision lies different, discrete communities that make up the region of the Sunshine Coast, which I share, as a federal MP, with the member for Fisher. In Fairfax, my electorate, which is on the northern end, there's a town called Nambour, which is key to the region. Nambour has had its challenges after the closing of a sugar mill, the Moreton mill, in 2003. Nambour is one of those unique places in Australia that maintains those values of the past but also possesses all of the opportunities of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been an absolute pleasure over the last 12 months working with community leaders as well as other tiers of government. I want to acknowledge local councillor Greg Rodgerson and state MP Marty Hunt. They have worked with me and other community leaders on a project called Reimagine Nambour, which has been partly funded by the federal government but also by the mayor and Councillor Rodgerson. Reimagine Nambour is a project that is casting the map of the future for the town. In particular, the town wants to maintain its distinct, unique identity, but it wants to transition its economy. We are now only weeks away from presenting to the community what Reimagine Nambour looks like, and I wanted to take this opportunity to let the parliament know that I look forward to speaking again in this chamber or in the House and presenting what that future plan is.
