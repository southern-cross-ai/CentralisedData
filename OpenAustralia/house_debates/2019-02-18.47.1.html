        It's a great opportunity today to give a shout-out to an outstanding young 11-year-old, Samuel Glancy, for the work he's been doing over the past couple of years to raise supplies for local schoolkids in need. His Kids4Kids supply drive has helped hundreds of students, particularly those without the basic tools of learning, since 2017. Samuel has clearly said he wants to see no child go without school supplies in Queensland, and his Kids4Kids fundraiser is just one of his 16 different various fundraising projects that he likes to run to help charities for local schoolchildren and also for struggling families and teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year Samuel arranged for donation boxes to be placed at various stores and locations around Logan, including my office in Beenleigh, where the community could donate both second-hand and new stationery items. Over 19,000 items were collected this year, and they were all collated at Calvary Christian College at Springwood. Then a group of volunteers went through and sorted them into packs for the various students.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Samuel so much for the work he has done, I want to thank the community for their support. I think it's always a privilege in this job to see the wonderful work that members of our community do to support others in need, and I wish Samuel all the best in his studies for the coming year.
