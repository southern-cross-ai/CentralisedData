        Following on from those comments from the Prime Minister, my question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister please outline to the House how the Morrison government is delivering on its plans to secure Australia's economic future and keep Australia safe, including by reopening the nation through increased COVID-19 vaccine rates?

         I thank the member for Leichardt for his question. I am so pleased, as I know the people of Leichardt are so pleased, that the member for Leichardt is putting himself forward again at the next election. He's stood with us as a coalition for many, many years. He is one of the most experienced and dedicated members of this House and a champion of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         At the last election, he and I stood together and we told the Australian people, together with the government members, that we were going to build our economy to secure Australia's future. At that time, none of us could have known the challenges that would come Australia's way at the time of the last election, in particular in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and the global recession that followed from that pandemic. But the national plans we have put in place over the course of this parliamentary term have served that purpose—to secure Australia's future. Despite the challenges and uncertainty we have faced as a country, Australians can still plan for their future with confidence. Our COVID response plan and the national plan to reopen Australia is effective, is working and is opening up the country—75 per cent double dose vaccination rates have now been achieved across the country. Three quarters of those aged over 16 have been vaccinated. We have one of the lowest rates of fatalities of COVID-19 in the world. We are one of the strongest economies to power through the COVID-19 pandemic and the recession that followed it. Now we are on our way to having the highest COVID-19 vaccine rates around the world, and today we have announced the booster program. There are enough vaccines in Australia not only for the boosters but for everyone who wants one to get one, and to assure, particularly in

         and Queensland, that those rates can rise.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is the economic recovery plan that the Treasurer has led, the budgets that he has brought down, lower taxes, infrastructure spending, skill spending, manufacturing and energy, defence industry, recycling, our rare earths and critical minerals strategy in the resources sector, our agricultural 2030 plan and the record investments going to science research, and, of course our national plan to ensure that we can achieve our target of net zero emissions by 2050—without taxes, without putting burdens on Australians or targeting sectors or telling Australians what they should be doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is our national security plan, which was realised again last night, when Australia was the first country to achieve a comprehensive, strategic partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         . This is a significant achievement, and I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs. To be present at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Summit" rel="nofollow">
          East Asia Summit
         </a>
         as ASEAN's first comprehensive strategic partner is a great achievement for Australia. But that is backed up by our leadership through the Quad nations, backed up through the partnerships formed through AUKUS and our record defence spending, as well as keeping kids safe online and keeping our borders safe. These national plans are delivering for Australia.
