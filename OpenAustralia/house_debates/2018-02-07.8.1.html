       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018, and its subsequent subordinate legislation, is a substantial modernisation of the legislation that regulates the importation and first supply of road vehicles in Australia. Changes contained in that bill will affect a wide range of businesses involved in the automotive sector, ranging from multinational vehicle manufacturers to small independent registered automotive workshops and individual consumers seeking to bring into the country a road vehicle for a special purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the bill does not materially change the current obligations on vehicle manufacturers and importers, it does realign the point at which conformance to those obligations is to be demonstrated and it introduces new regulatory tools.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government recognises that these changes will require a period of transition to enable entities involved in the provision of road vehicles to the Australian market to adapt their business models and achieve the smoothest possible transition to the new legislative framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 contains transitional and consequential provisions to support the commencement of the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 when it replaces the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 as the Commonwealth's primary legislation for regulating road vehicles and certain road vehicle components.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, this bill repeals the old law—the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989—and makes provision for a 12-month transition period starting from the full commencement of the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018. To complement that bill, this transitional bill will allow regulated industry stakeholders to make the necessary changes to transition to the new regulatory framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the 12-month transitional period provided for under this bill, aspects of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act and related legislation will continue to have effect. The objective of this approach is that entities currently operating under the old law, particularly registered automotive workshops, are not disadvantaged by having to change their established operating practices at short notice, but instead have reasonable time to transfer to the new road vehicle standards legislation requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the bill makes consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation to reflect the repeal of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act and substitute relevant references to the Road Vehicle Standards Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, the bill provides clarity concerning compliance and enforcement powers during the transition period. The Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 provides an improved regulatory toolkit, based on the Regulatory Powers Act 2014 (and subsequent amendments). This bill clarifies the application of these powers during the transition period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, this bill also provides incentives to certain approval holders to become early adopters of the new regulatory framework introduced by the Road Vehicle Standards Bill. It does this by enabling evidence submitted for their current approvals to support their applications for new approvals under the Road Vehicle Standards Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear guidance will be provided to industry stakeholders and the general public to ensure they are aware of any rights or obligations which will apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
