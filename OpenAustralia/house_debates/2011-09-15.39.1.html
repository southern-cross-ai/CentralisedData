        It is great to finally get the call on statements by members because I wanted to introduce members to some great young Indigenous people, students from my electorate who were here in

        </a>
        this week as part of the Learn Earn Legend! work experience in government program. On Monday and Tuesday, Jocelyn Duncan, Rebecca Whyte, Peter Spanner, Angus Dorante and Jon Mau were here getting to know their way around Parliament House and seeing what life is like working with an MP or senator.

        Earlier this week they began a placement within the federal government department of their choice as a way of introducing them to the opportunities that are there if they want to pursue a career in the Public Service. Jocelyn, Peter and Rebecca attend Rockhampton State High School and Jon and Angus, both

        at Yeppoon. I know their schools are very proud to be represented by such fine young people in the work experience program. These five students are among 100 from around Australia who were selected as future Indigenous leaders in their communities, and I know that the week has opened their eyes to the many opportunities that are out there if they continue the hard work and commitment to their studies they have shown so far.

        There has been a lot for them to take in, meeting the Prime Minister and stars like
