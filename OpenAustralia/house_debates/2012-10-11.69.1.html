        On Saturday night I had the pleasure to act as auctioneer for the

        of Queensland and the chair of the Townsville Hospital Foundation, and he lifted all restraining orders against me for the evening. Dr Robert Tam is a heart specialist in Townsville, and he spoke beautifully about the need for resources for the Townsville Hospital. He also did a portrait of

        has had his own bout with cancer, and his work has been relentlessâ€”he has no voice left. He spoke about his battle with cancer and he said he was okay because he had spent some time with a two-year-old who was dying of leukaemia, and she had a smile on her face, so he said what he had was absolutely nothing.

        IGA franchisees from all over Australia were there. There was the cast from the local production of
        <i>
         Hairspray
        </i>
        , including my friend Vicky Saylor, who helped us with the music. We raised $141,000 on the night, with over 700 people packing a marquee at Jupiters in Townsville.
