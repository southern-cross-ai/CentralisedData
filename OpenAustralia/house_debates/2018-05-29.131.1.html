        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Bennett" rel="nofollow">
         Betty Bennett
        </a>
        of Casino is calling it a day. Betty started her career at 17 years of age, in 1966. She left the profession in 1969 to get married to John and have her three children, Adrian, Kim and Jamie. She returned to nursing in 1973 and studied midwifery in 1977. She has diligently served our local community for four decades. In some instances, she has delivered every member of the family: mum, dad and all the children. Working in a regional hospital, Betty has gained skills not only in midwifery but in all areas, including emergency care and theatre. Betty's last day as a nurse will be 15 July. She plans a trip to Switzerland and then would like to help with remedial reading in schools. Betty will be sorely missed. On behalf of our community, thank you, Betty.

        This month the wonderfully unique community of Nimbin is celebrating the 45th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Aquarius Festival
        </a>
        , which not only changed the future of the town but also made its mark on Australia. I would like to thank the organisers of the 15-day celebration: John Tozeland; Katie Cawcutt; the co-editor of
        <i>
         The Nimbin Good Times
        </i>
        , Bob Dooley;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         Teddy Davis
        </a>
        ; Binnah Pownall and Benny McGovern. This year the organisers took a whole-of-town approach to recognising Indigenous people, the early settlers and the Aquarius, which have all made Nimbin what it is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the early seventies Nimbin was a dairy town, when Paul Joseph, who was then living in nearby Mullumbimby, and a few others decided to celebrate and encourage the back-to-the-land movement. Paul, known as the song man at the Aquarius Festival, realised Nimbin was economically struggling and decided to do something significant and recycle a town. Paul approached the Nimbin Progress Association to host a festival in the fields around the town and use the town's facilities. Three buildings were also purchased for the festival: the Tomato Sauce Building, now Hemp Embassy; the Rainbow Cafe; and Birth &amp; Beyond. One of the obstacles the organisers faced was that, under the culture of the local Bundjalung people, the area was taboo for women. Their solution was to ask an elder, Richard Donnelly, to lift the spirit. This was probably one of the first welcomes to country that we practice today. Fittingly, Richard's grandson, Tony, and granddaughter were both at this year's festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        That spirit of doing it for yourself and sustainability is still as strong in Nimbin as it was 45 years ago. After the last few years, the community has come together to raise almost $160,000 to buy a derelict house in the main street for what Natalie Meyer from the Nimbin Neighbourhood &amp; Information Centre told me is the town's biggest recycling project yet. By September, this once-condemned house will be transformed into a new, community-owned-and-operated tools library. Their hope is to eventually build a two-storey building behind the house to promote the use of hemp building products. The town also embraced permaculture long before the rest of the country had heard of it. Today, Nimbin's permaculture garden attracts thousands of visitors every year, including from overseas, to learn about agriculture and food production. They have led the charge to legalise the medicinal use of cannabis, which this government did last year. Is it any wonder that more tourists visit Nimbin than nearly anywhere in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        ? In fact, the only two places in New South Wales that attract more tourists are Sydney and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Byron Bay
        </a>
        . This is an amazing statistic given the town's population is around 1,000 and fewer than 10,000 people live within a 15-kilometre radius. Congratulations, Nimbin.

        The Lismore City Rugby Club, which was one of the first clubs on the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        , is celebrating its 50th anniversary on 9 June. I'd like to thank the organising committee of Stuart Edmonds; Neal Short; Chris Lomax, who was a founder member;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lawson" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Lawson
        </a>
        ; and John Lisetto, who are putting together the celebration to be held at the Italo Australian Club in Lismore. Over its 50 years, the club has produced some world-class players, with Izack Rodda playing for the Wallabies last year and Declan Curran playing with the national team in the early eighties. At the anniversary celebrations roughly half of the first team the club fielded will be there to mark the milestone. I would like to acknowledge Jim Poulos, Wilson Cregan, Paul Starkey,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Roberts
        </a>

        I want to congratulate Lachlan Rooke, Damon-Leigh Striegher, Jacob Roberts and Phoenix Versfeld for winning the Coffs Harbour Schools Secondary Squash Challenge U15 division for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolgoolga_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Woolgoolga High School
        </a>
        for the second year in a row.
       </p>
       <p>
        Woolgoolga High had two teams in the competition, and they ended up playing each other in the final. The other team consisted of Samuel Moriz, Ethan Pursch, Callum Roworth and Luke Taylor. The school has also competed in the combined high schools competition recently. The boys' team consisted of Ethan Pursch, Samuel Moriz and Lachlan Rooke, and they made it to the semi-finals. In the girls' division, Charlise Sharp and Isabel Hallam played very well in their first competition. I'd like to wish Sam, Lachlan and Ethan all the best at the North Coast combined high schools squash trials next week.

        Grafton Redmen Rugby Union celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. I'd like to congratulate the Grafton Redmen Rugby Union Club, which celebrated its 50th year with a dinner last Saturday night. The club was formed in 1969 with the help of former Wallaby Bruce Judd and was one of the first clubs established on the north coast of New South Wales. Over that time the Redmen have won four premierships, more than 10 minor grade titles and seven club championships. Last weekend, the club fielded its first women's team, the Rubies. Well done to Captain Bridgett Mawhirtt and the team. Congratulations also to the executive of the Redmens, Sean Austin, Guy Robertson, Adam Crawley and Dom Bullock for their both on and off the field this season. Also, congratulations to Steve McKimm, Jason Connors and Gary Nicholls who organised the anniversary dinner last Saturday. The club has produced some great players who've gone on to represent Australia, including Xavier Sullivan, who played in the Australian under-16s team, and Kristy Frogley, who played for the Wallaroos in the 2006

        I'd like to congratulate Stuart George, who after 10 years as president of Casino Beef Week announced his retirement this year. It is in its 36th year, but at one point in 2007 it nearly folded when Beef Week was not held. It was then that Stuart was approached by the mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Valley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Richmond Valley Council
        </a>
        at the time, Col Sullivan, to take over as president. Since then, it has grown every year, with an estimated 40,000 people now attending the 11-day festival, which generates well over $3 million annually for the local economy. Last Saturday, the cattle competition and street parade alone drew over 15,000 people to Casino's streets.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government believes so much in what this event is achieving, we gave $1 million over four years to ensure its future for many years. I'd like to thank Stuart and his wife Margie. No-one works in isolation, and Stuart has had a great team behind him, including committee members Frank McKey, Belinda Dockrill, Grant Sheddon, Sam Rickson, Jenna Bailey, Brodie Lisha, and the staff—Lena Magner, Kaela McRae and Sophie Lynch. I'd also like to congratulate this year's Beef Week Queen, Madeleine Barrett from Old Bonalbo, as well as the other entrants, Holly Cameron and Stephanie Darragh. And also to Ammul Claydon from Casino, who was crowned Mr Beef for 2018. Casino, the beef capital of Australia. Well done.
