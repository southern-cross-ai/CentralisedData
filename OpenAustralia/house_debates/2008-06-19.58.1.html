           I thank the member for Throsby for her question and acknowledge her keen interest in the government’s position on opposing the killing of whales. I will be leading Australia’s delegation to the

           meeting in Chile, where I will introduce the Australian government’s proposal for a new future for the International Whaling Commission—a proposal that has attracted strong support from like-minded nations. This proposal has three elements: internationally agreed cooperative conservation plans for whales; collaborative research programs; and reform of the management of science, including an end to the granting of special permits for so-called scientific whaling. These proposals are underpinned by firm commitments and real science, including an extra $1 million from the government for the Australian Marine Mammal Centre to continue its non-lethal research program and to establish international cooperative research programs and conservation management plans for the great whales of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
            Southern Ocean
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Last Saturday I released a progress report on the global study I have commissioned of the science and economics of whale conservation. This study is bolstering our call for better protection of whales and providing important data to support our case at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWC" rel="nofollow">
            IWC
           </a>
           . Just this week members may have seen further scientific analysis of the threats climate change poses to whales—in particular, the potential impacts of shrinking Antarctic sea ice on whales’ critical habitats. This accumulation of new and existing threats is the reason why we must do all we can and why the government is committed to bringing an end to commercial whaling in all its forms. It is an approach that recognises that it is not good enough to go through the motions—like the last 12 years of ritualised, lacklustre and unfocused policy under the Liberal Party and like the last 12 years of rhetoric and press releases which produced nothing. We accept the need to strive for reform of the IWC and to work both inside and outside the commission to increase the protection of whales. That is why we have embarked on enhanced diplomatic efforts and why we continue to pursue a range of actions the previous government never contemplated.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am surprised that the opposition is not supporting the Rudd Labor government’s reform proposals, given we are the only nation with a constructive proposal of this scope on the table at the International Whaling Commission. I look at what happened on the previous government’s watch and I see that the number of whales targeted by Japan more than doubled between 2004-05 and 2005-06. It doubled from 440 to more than 900, including a quota of endangered fin whales. That was on the previous government’s watch, and that is where we find ourselves today. When the member for Flinders was trying to defend 12 years of inaction, he told the ABC on 15 January:

           Well, let’s be clear that we won every vote in the International Whaling Commission year after year.

                          engagement is going to be easier, but the government actually do have a policy for reform. We have a constructive approach we are bringing to the table. But all the opposition ever seems to do is to talk down Australia’s prospects of success. All we have had from the opposition is negative or confused in approach and, when it comes to confusion, the member for Flinders could not wait for the

                          last January. In fact, he was pleading with the government on 16 January when he said the

                          ‘must now arrive to not only help monitor and protect the great whales of the south but also to help act as a balance and to keep the peace on the high seas’. Of course, the
                          <i>
                           Oceanic Viking
                          </i>
                          did undertake monitoring and surveillance in the Southern Ocean, something that was never achieved in the 12 previous years of the Liberal government. Then we had the member for Goldstein making his contribution on 15 June about the Australian government’s action. He said:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          It has reduced our credibility, reduced our leverage, our negotiating position in trying to reach a diplomatic solution.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I cannot think of a weaker message to be sending on Australia’s commitment to whale conservation than what the opposition have been saying, with their confused actions, their negativism and their record of seeing the whale quotas increase by a considerable number on their watch.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There is a lot of noise from members opposite because they recognise that their policy on this issue delivered absolutely nothing over 12 years. It is time for them to get serious and to resolve what they actually think about this issue and to look at the substantial engagement that the Rudd government has to get behind the strong proposals to refocus the International Whaling Commission on the conservation of whales—to come in with all of Australia as we chart a new course in the protection of these magnificent sea creatures.
