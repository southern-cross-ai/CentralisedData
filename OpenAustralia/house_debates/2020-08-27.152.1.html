       <p>
        I am very proud of our military and veteran heritage up in the north of Australia, the place that I represent—Darwin and the rest of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

         US Marine
        </a>
        officer Lieutenant Colonel David Banning, who reminded all present of the historic and deep relationship between the

        I also want to acknowledge Veterans Australia NT, who have taken many steps to support younger veterans over the years. Some local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERFET" rel="nofollow">
         INTERFET
        </a>
        veterans and Vietnam veterans felt that more could be done to commemorate the important deployment from Darwin of INTERFET 21 years ago. As a result, on the weekend of 19 and 20 September, next month, we will be commemorating that deployment. On Saturday 19 September, there will be a service at the Darwin Cenotaph, followed by a lunch at NT Parliament House. The following day, on Sunday 20 September, there will be an informal barbeque at Veterans Australia NT, out in the rural area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking at the commemorative service will be Colonel John Papalitsas, who is currently the commander of the Regional Force Surveillance Group and was a platoon commander with the 3rd Battalion Old Faithful during that INTERFET deployment; and also

        —a veteran from Darwin. All INTERFET veterans are invited to come to Darwin—if you're not from a hotspot. Check with the NT government's Health website to see whether we'll let you in! I want to give a shout-out to all INTERFET veterans and welcome them to Darwin. Also out of Veterans Australia NT recently we've had the dedication of a
