       <p>
        I rise to speak tonight about a very important matter for the people of my electorate of Bean, for the Labor members of this parliament and for thousands of workers across the country, and that is the increasing disrespect and growing occurrence of abuse and sexual harassment of our hardworking retail workforce on the back of a growing number of wage theft instances across the retail sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that retailers and hospitality workers work hard to provide the general public with customer service, particularly at this time of year. I started my career in retail. I was a Big W Woden worker in my early working life. I know the important role that retail workers play in our community and I know the stress they can often be under, especially at peak times of the year such as the Christmas season. I remember those Saturday mornings with stressed customers who had left their shopping until the last couple of weeksâ€”we've all been there. I remember one customer in particular was rather disappointed that we were out of stock of Cabbage Patch dolls. As a then naive young worker, for the first time I saw another, less joyful, side to the silly season.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, in a more modern setting that sort of stress has turned to abuse; disappointment has turned to aggression. In some cases, a simple inquiry turns into a case of sexual harassment. This was confirmed in a recent survey of retail workers by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association in partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Human Rights Commission
        </a>
        . The survey of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
         SDA
        </a>
        members was designed to find out more about the nature and prevalence of sexual harassment experienced by retail and fast-food workers. The survey belled the cat on what we thought might have been happening in the sector. It found that, unfortunately, 87 per cent of respondents had experienced verbal abuse or aggressive behaviour. This is simply not good enough. And worse, shockingly, 39 per cent had experienced workplace sexual harassment in the last five years, with most of these cases not being reported. Unfortunately, this is because members didn't have confidence that the issues would be addressed. This was highlighted by only 13 per cent of respondents saying that the incidents resulted in a formal report or complaint. I know we all would agree that that's not good enough. Retail workers must have a safe worksite, just like we enjoy here.
       </p>
       <p>
        The workers across this sector have also felt the impact of wage theft, with millions of dollars not being fairly paid to workers. These workers should be treated with respect and dignity. They are entitled to ask for the basics: a safe and respectful workplace, and proper pay and conditions. South.Point, or the Hyperdome, the local shopping centre across the road from my electorate office, is open for extended trading hours in the lead-up to Christmas, with retail staff working until 9 pm, and 10 pm for some of the larger department stores. I've no doubt shopping centres and restaurants Australia-wide will be doing much the same over this period. I say to those workers in that mall, and in other shops, 'You are valued, and we'll stand up for your rights.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I am supporter of the 'No-one Deserve a Serve' campaign, as is every member on this side of the chamber. I dare say it's supported by many members elsewhere in this chamber. It's a campaign designed by SDA members to educate consumers and reinforce the rights of workers to be able to do their jobs without fear of abuse or violence in the workplace. Retailers have worked with the SDA to establish an industry pledge that aims to create a safer environment for retail workers. I commend the sector at large for accepting a leading role in being part of the solution. It's a great example of cooperative industrial relations. I commend the campaign and ask all members and all our community this Christmas to smile, show some respect, say hello and interact with retail and hospitality workers across this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just very briefly, I wish to pay my respects to one of my namesakes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         David Smith
