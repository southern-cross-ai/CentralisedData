         <p>
          On behalf of the government and people of Australia I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the two Australians killed in the terrorist attacks most recently conducted in Mumbai in India. During this very difficult time our thoughts and prayers have been with the families of Mr Brett Taylor and Mr Douglas Markell, both of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          . Our thoughts are also with those Australians who were caught up in the violence, the four Australians who were physically injured in the attacks and the many others who have been affected personally by this terrible event.
         </p>
         <p>
          As we grieve for our own citizens and injured, we must also bear in mind the extraordinary toll this has had on the people of India. We must remember too that citizens from around the world have been affected as well. We are truly now in a global village; an attack in any part of the world now affects us all. The Australian government extends its sympathy and condolences to the people and government of India and to other foreign nationals who have been caught up in this violence.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian government continues to offer help to Australians who have been caught up in the violence. We are offering support to people to help manage the physical, the financial and, critically, the emotional impact of these attacks. This includes practical assistance such as counselling services, emergency accommodation, travel coordination and assistance in organising travel documentation.
         </p>
         <p>
          These attacks remind us of the need to remain vigilant against terrorism in all its forms. We need to continue to take concerted international action against al-Qaeda and any other terrorist group. These terrorists are the enemies of us all, without distinction on national boundary. Australia stands with India at this time. We are offering any assistance that our friends in New Delhi may require. It is important at this point that we get to the bottom of this incident and track down those who have been responsible for its execution and for its planning.
         </p>
         <p>
          India has faced a longstanding terrorist threat from a range of extremist and separatist groups, including Kashmiri militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, otherwise known as LeT. This group has mounted previous attacks on India, including outside Kashmir. Certainly, there has been considerable activity on the part of this organisation in the past. Certainly no country has more experience in combating terrorism than India. We know that a group calling itself the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Mujaheddin" rel="nofollow">
           Deccan Mujaheddin
          </a>
          has claimed responsibility for this appalling attack.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is too early to speculate on who precisely are the perpetrators of these attacks in Mumbai. We have confidence that the Indian authorities will investigate this thoroughly and bring those responsible to justice. We call on all nations to support India’s efforts. It is important at this troubled time that India and Pakistan work together to deal with the challenge of terrorism, to counter terrorism and to root out those groups who have been responsible. Australia welcomes the commitment by Pakistani President Zadari to cooperate in exposing and apprehending all culprits.
         </p>
         <p>
          Despite massive efforts by governments around the world against international terrorism and many successes in disrupting terrorist planning, the fact is that al-Qaeda and other groups have proven to be resilient and innovative. The threat from international terrorism has not been eliminated. Australians, particularly when overseas, must continue to be vigilant. Australians when overseas will continue to be at risk from terrorism. It is time for the world to redouble our efforts to rid us once and for all of this scourge, the enemy of all civilised peoples.

          <p>
           Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the opposition I wish to associate us with the Prime Minister’s remarks. We share the very fine sentiments he has expressed. As Thursday’s tragic events in Mumbai remind us, the threat from terrorism is very real. It threatens Australians around the world. This sordid and murderous assault on India’s most cosmopolitan city was designed to strike at the heart of the confidence that has seen India, in its economic growth, in its democracy, pull so many millions of people out of the very depths of poverty. It is designed to set India back on the path that it has undertaken.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were many Australians in Mumbai on that awful night, as indeed there are on every night—working, holidaying, going about their business peacefully. The heartbreaking news for us is that at least two Australians, Mr Brett Taylor and Mr Douglas Markell, both of Sydney, have lost their lives at the hands of these murderers. Mr Markell was a constituent of mine and a former deputy mayor of Woollahra. He was a committed, energetic, hardworking, civic minded Australian. Our prayers and condolences go to Mr Taylor’s family and Mr Markell’s family, as indeed they go to the families of all those who have been killed or injured in this dreadful attack. The attack reminds us of the global threat of terrorism, its mindlessness, its cruelty and its indifference to the horrors that it inflicts on peaceful people.
          </p>
          <p>
           Who among us will ever forget the photograph of one of the gunmen—barely out of his teens, assault rifle ready to kill, eyes crazed, no concern for the horror he was inflicting? We know from those cruel eyes that terrorism still stalks the planet. It is still out there poisoning young minds and making the world less safe and secure. We have seen it on 9-11 and with the Bali bombings. We have seen it in London and Madrid. We have seen it in the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, and so the terrible list goes on. Now in Mumbai another 195 people or more, including 18 foreigners, have lost their lives as a result of this senseless savagery.
          </p>
          <p>
           These dreadful events remind us that in a global world, security is indivisible and that the threat to free societies has not retreated. We know also that we must remain vigilant and resolute in our determination to confront the enemies of freedom and democracy wherever they may strike, and we offer our support, our solidarity, our love to the people of India and our help wherever we can to defeat those who would seek to create chaos and fear in our midst.
