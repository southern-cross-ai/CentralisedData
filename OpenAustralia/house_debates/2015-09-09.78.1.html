        My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister please update the House on the obstacles that the government must overcome to deliver the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, and what benefits will flow in terms of jobs when the agreement is delivered?

         I thank the member for Petrie for his question. I know he, like all members of this House, is incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement provides for jobs and growth in the Australian economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         But he specifically asks about the obstacles that exist to delivering this transformative export agreement, and the obstacles all appear to be contained in the myths and lies from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         and other unions in Australia, who are trying to frighten the Australian public about the impact of what will truly be changing for our economy in a very positive way. The three myths propagated by the CFMEU and their cat's paw here in the national parliament, the Labor Party, are about the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement changing access to the labour market, about labour market testing and about unlicensed workers. Let's deal with each of those three myths, because on Monday Jan Adams, the lead negotiator for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         , for the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, dealt with each of these. On access to the labour market she said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … the China free trade agreement will not allow unrestricted access to the Australian labour market by Chinese workers. It will not allow Australian employment laws or conditions to be undermined, and it will not allow companies to avoid paying Australian wages by using foreign workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         So myth No. 1 is exploded. They also say that labour market testing will be abandoned because of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Ms Adams says in relation to that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … employers seeking to sponsor an overseas worker under an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFA" rel="nofollow">
          IFA
         </a>
         Project Agreement must demonstrate a labour market need and prove that Australians have been provided first opportunity through labour market testing …
        </p>
        <p>
         So myth No. 2 is exploded. Finally, the really heinous myth is to try to frighten old people in their homes about unlicensed electricity workers and others. With respect to unlicensed workers she said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Upon arrival in Australia, they—
        </p>
        <p>
         temporary visa applicants—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         must still obtain any required federal, state or territory licences or registration to commence work, including workplace health and safety. Claims to the contrary are simply wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
         So all the three myths created by the CFMEU and their cat's paw here in Canberra have been exploded by the facts.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor Party should follow the advice of people like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Weatherill" rel="nofollow">
          Jay Weatherill

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . He said only today:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Nobody seriously thinks that we are entering into this free-trade agreement to create jobs in another country or for foreign workers to come and work here and then go back to their country of origin.
        </p>
        <p>
         In other words, he recognises the benefits to the Australian economy, and Labor should too.
