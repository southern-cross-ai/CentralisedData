       <p>
        On Wednesday, 5 November I attended Northlakes Public School and officially reopened their special playground area, their fenced play area. They have a support unit at Northlakes Public School and some young people with significant disabilities attend that school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thing that was so special about the reopening of the support unit was that the parents formed a subcommittee and raised funds to have the upgrade of the play equipment in this area. It is great because it will allow the integration of the kids in the special unit with the rest of the school, because they will come in and they will use the special play equipment. The support unit subcommittee, comprised of Renee Clover, Kelly Southwell and Nathan and Rebecca Crumbley, went out and raised funds by selling raffle tickets and going to Bunnings and holding barbecuesâ€”they got out there and did the work. It was a fantastic effort and every one of the people on the committee are commended for what they have done. The young people who will use that equipment will enjoy it into the future, and they will value the contribution made by the committee and the support given by the school.
