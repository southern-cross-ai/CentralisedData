        . Is the minister aware that, at a public meeting held in Innisfail two years ago,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
         AQIS
        </a>
        could not recall a single application that had been rejected by them in the last seven years? A recent media article said not a single application had been agreed to by the Europeans in the last three years. In

        two of our main crops are sugar and mangoes. America has allowed no sugar and no mangoes into the United States. Finally, all other countries scientifically assess and almost invariably say no. What credibility has Australia with AQIS, who invariably say yes—the gang that just cannot say no?

         Once again, I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do know that he is very seriously concerned and is representing the concern of his constituents. I indicate though that I do not agree with him on the question of the professionalism and dedication of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
          AQIS
         </a>
         officers. I believe they go about the tasks that we ask them to do with all good skills and with professionalism. I also say to the member for Kennedy: while I do understand how deep his concern is, this import risk analysis has been in development now for a long period of time. The first request from the Philippines came in May 1999. An issues paper was issued on 2 May 2001. A technical information paper followed on 6 May 2002. A draft import risk analysis report was delivered on 1 July 2002. There was a revised draft on 19 February 2004. There was an addendum to the revised draft on 16 June 2004. There was a revised draft again on 1 March 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
         I indicate to members in this House that this has been a long-running process, a process that has been in train under both sides of politics over a number of terms of this parliament. It has resulted in the independently generated scientific assessment that has been reviewed by the Eminent Scientists Group. It is a process used by both sides of parliament to deal with these issues, which I freely admit are difficult issues and are particularly difficult for the growers in the industry sector. What I can say to the member for Kennedy, and what I did indicate to him in my last answer, is that the final import risk analysis report issued by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Biosecurity Australia
         </a>
         is open to appeal until 12 December and it may be—I am certainly not indicating to the member for Kennedy what particular course of action he should take—that he or people that he is in contact with might want to use that appeal facility.

             Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Mr Speaker, you have shown exemplary impartiality in your term as Speaker, and if this is the day for taking people to task for alleged stunts, surely the Leader of the House should be taken to task for what he has just said?

              That is a fair cop. A stunt is a stunt whichever side it comes from, and I think everybody recognises what was going on there. I do not condone it. I am quite happy to get the ball rolling. I think that people will understand that—

               If those words were directed at the stunt, I agree with them. If they were directed at me, I am not very happy about them at all. At a time when there were articles on the weekend talking about how people treat each other, there are lessons for all of us in this. I have to say that I am amazed that we expect the gallery to remain alert. I am not sure, because I have some sympathy from time to time with the gallery not being alert all of the time, about what is going on here. But I simply say to all—

                 I simply say to the member for Banks that, whilst the word ‘gallery’ does include those who are behind me—I do not have the opportunity of knowing what they are doing—I was talking about other galleries. I think that it is a bit rich if we expect behaviour in the galleries that we are not willing to demonstrate ourselves here.

                   My intention was to try to move this on quickly and not overly embarrass anybody. But the types of comments that are continually made when we have these discussions do none of us any credit—even those who behave exemplarily. I really do think that, if I gave the member for Corangamite the call and we got on with the business that we are here to do, that might suffice at this point in time, without indicating that some of the things that have recently gone on are agreed with.

                    Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Leader of the House stood up, received the call and made an allegation against the member for
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
                     McEwen
                    </a>
                    . It was a slur and it was inaccurate. If people are allowed to simply approach the microphone, make an inaccurate slur against another member and sit down without any form of punishment, then it is going to be very difficult to maintain decorum on both sides of the House.

                    <p>
                     I simply say: I thank the House for its cooperation. It is a very hard thing to be able to discuss this matter, because, as the member for
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                      North Sydney
                     </a>
                     is aware, at the same time there was a similar incident. If the member involved had been displaying a lack of alertness, an attendant would have gone up to that member and made them alert—and on this occasion I am not talking about the member questioned by the Leader of the House. This makes it difficult to give definitive rulings. I am just suggesting to you that, if we expect behaviour of people in the gallery without expecting it of people in the House, and then we get precious about things, there are a lot of comments that are made in this place that I can highlight by taking action. If that is what the Manager of Opposition Business wants, I will do it.

                      —today of all days. Mr Speaker, is it appropriate for anyone to stand up in this place, launch an allegation against another member and sit down without even a reprimand from the Speaker?

                       I have indicated to the Manager of Opposition Business that, unlike a lot of members of this House, I admit that from time to time I make mistakes. Maybe if I had sat the Leader of the House on his tail, warned him, lashed him—whatever you want me to do to him—it may have been better. But I simply say to the Manager of Opposition Business that if he wants the incident that led to this discussed I will be very interested in how it is handled by those who sit behind me.
