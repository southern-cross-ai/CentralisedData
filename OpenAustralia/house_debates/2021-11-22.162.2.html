        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Ebert" rel="nofollow">
         Russell Ebert

        , who passed away on 5 November after his battle with acute myeloid leukaemia. He was farewelled by more than 4,000 people at a state funeral service held last week on the grounds of his old stomping ground, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">

        Football Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russell's football career was extraordinary. His highlights include 392 games with Port Adelaide, including three premiership games, and 25 with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">

        . He represented

        </a>
        29 times, three times as captain. He's the only winner of four Magarey medals. He was six times Port Adelaide's best and fairest. He was the first winner of the

        medal. And he was inducted into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Football Hall of Fame
        </a>
        in 1996. He is one of only four
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        footballers to have his statue at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Oval
        </a>
        . And, finally, he was inducted into the South Australian Sport Hall of Fame. When his playing days ended, Russell went on to coach Port Adelaide, Woodville and the South Australian state team. In 2003, his son Brett won the Magarey medal—uniquely, making Russell and Brett the only father-son duo to do so that I know of.
       </p>
       <p>
        Football was not the only focus of Russell's public life. He immersed himself in the work of several charities, particularly supporting young people. I personally came to know Russell when I was mayor of Salisbury and we jointly spoke at drug awareness forums at high schools in the Salisbury area. It became very clear from the many beautiful tributes at his farewell service, and in the media, that Russell lived by the standards that he mentored and guided others with. He reached out, made time and lent a hand to anyone in need—but he never lost sight of his own family, to whom he was devoted and for whom his passing will be felt the most. To his wife, Dian; to his children, Tammy, Ben and Brett; and to all of his other family members, I offer my personal condolences and respect for Russell.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a very fitting public gesture, Russell's South Australian sporting hall of fame award was presented to him shortly before his passing by his on-field adversary but off-field close friend, and also a legendary South Australian footballer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie_Robran" rel="nofollow">
         Barrie Robran
        </a>
        , with whom Russell is so often compared. I do not believe that we will see the likes of Russell Ebert again, but for those who came to know him and who had the opportunity to watch him play football, Russell Ebert will not be forgotten.
