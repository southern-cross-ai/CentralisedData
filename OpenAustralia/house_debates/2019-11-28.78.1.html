        The government is being run by a bunch of children. The minister for emissions reductions, instead of concentrating on producing policies to actually reduce emissions and reduce skyrocketing electricity prices, is playing childish games, providing fraudulent documents to

        about the travel bill of a local mayor. That's what this government has stooped to. And, when he was caught out, he claimed he knew nothing and he came into this parliament and misled the parliament. He's now dragged the Prime Minister into it, and the minister's cowardice has led to a police investigation: Strike Force Garrad.

        police minister to try to intervene in the matter and, instead of coming into the parliament and telling the truth, he makes a claim about former Prime Minister Julia Gillard that was based on a false quote from a shock jock rather than a Victorian police officer. Now the Prime Minister refuses to have the gumption and courage to come in here and explain his actions to the Australian people. He refuses to apologise to the Australian people for misleading the parliament. That is the maturity of this government. Someone in this government is not telling the truth, but no-one is brave enough to fess up to the Australian people and tell them exactly what's going on.
