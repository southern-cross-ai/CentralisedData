       <p>
        As this year's parliamentary sitting calendar comes to a close, I would like to take the opportunity to wish all good members of this House a very merry Christmas and encourage them, when they return to their electorates, to remind their constituents of the devastating road rolls. In Australia in 2015 no fewer than 1,020 lives have been lost on Australian roads. As your families and constituents travel and as my constituents in the elctorate of Wright travel throughout Queensland and Australia to get to their destinations, I would encourage each of them to be road-wise and conscious of making sure they get home safely to their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        My message today is to every single member of the community of Wright: please be safe on the roads. In Queensland this week alone we have seen several fatalities on our roads; we do not need to see more. In Queensland our road toll stands at 221 deaths. Regretfully, this is already 11 more than in December last year. So I send a challenge out to everyone in my electorate: be safe on the road, do not speed, do not drink and drive, do not drive tired and do not let the screaming kids in the back seat distract you.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all members of the House: drive safely, enjoy the festive spirit and spend as much time as you can with your loved ones, because it is our families that make an enormous sacrifice due to our time spent away from them so that we can be great members to our communities.
       </p>
