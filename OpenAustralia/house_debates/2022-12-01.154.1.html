       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge an important group within my community: the Indian Society of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISWA" rel="nofollow">
         ISWA
        </a>
        . Incorporated in 1972, ISWA is a non-profit organisation with its headquarters in my electorate of Tangney. From its humble beginnings 40 years ago, ISWA has grown to a peak body of nearly 100 member associations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Indian community is among the fastest-growing immigrant communities in WA and comprises close to 100,000 in Western Australia, including those who migrated from other countries. ISWA has helped encourage and facilitate integration of the Indian diaspora within the Australian community. It has played a pivotal role in integrating, sharing and contributing Indian cultural heritage with the wider communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to state that ISWA has made and is continuing to make positive impacts in our community. The current management committee, under the leadership of the president, Mr Satish Nair, has taken ISWA to the next level, with a strong emphasis on increased community welfare. The opening of a $4 million Indian Community Centre last year, also in my electorate, has provided the community with a home. The centre was funded by both the federal and state governments. I have been fortunate to attend several community events and deeply admire the work of so many ISWA management committee members and volunteers who dedicate their valuable time and effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keeping the ISWA ethos in mind, ISWA organised several cultural events to showcase the rich Indian cultural heritage to the community. The Diwali Mela Festival of India is the most cherished event. This year it was celebrated on 22 and 23 October and was enjoyed by an estimated 35,000 people. The family event was filled with cultural performances, heritage stores and delicious Indian food. We celebrate the message of Diwali: the triumph of good over evil. The colour, the spectacular lights and the decoration and festivities were captivating.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased by the effort being taken by ISWA to encourage its member organisations, some of which represent different states of India who have their own unique cultures and traditions. I also appreciate the all-around community initiatives they have undertaken, such as by promoting a senior day-care centre to cater to the needs of the elderly; dance and music classes for younger students to learn the culture; language classes for the young so that they can relate to their roots; yoga activities; and connecting with many other multicultural groups to create a stronger WA community. It's amazing to see a volunteer-driven organisation achieve so much. I was pleased to see the effort they took in organising a COVID vaccination clinic, advocating mental health awareness sessions and addressing domestic violence in their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so fortunate to see the multicultural community prosper in WA. The growth and impact of ISWA within the Indian community is testament to the fact that Australia not only welcomes but encourages multicultural communities to flourish and reach our society with their culture and traditions. I wish ISWA the very best for the future and encourage their members to keep up the good work. I will borrow a quote that I have heard from the Indian community, which I believe is Sanskrit: 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam.' It means, 'The world is one family.'
