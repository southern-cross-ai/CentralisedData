        Australia remains a world leader for successful organ and tissue transplantation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority, known commonly as the Organ and Tissue Authority, manages the implementation of the Australian government's national reform program on organ and tissue donation for transplantation in partnership with:

        , Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Nash" rel="nofollow">
         Fiona Nash
        </a>
        , released the findings of the Ernst and Young Review of the National Reform Program on Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EY" rel="nofollow">
         EY
        </a>
        Review).
       </p>
       <p>
        The EY Review was prompted by concerns about the slowing of organ donation rates in Australia, and the need to review organ donation practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EY Review examined the respective contributions to the national reform program of the Organ and Tissue Authority, state and territory governments and the DonateLife Network hospitals and clinicians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EY review found that the national reform agenda, which was commenced in 2009, has been broadly effective. However, there is scope for improvement in the areas of governance, transparency and accountability. To improve these areas, the review made 24 recommendations, including endorsing the Australian government's 2015-16 budget measure accelerating growth in organ and tissue donation for transplantation; better training for clinicians; activities that states and territories should consider to better support the implementation of the reform agenda; as well as the fundamental changes to the governance arrangements for the Organ and Tissue Authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stakeholders consulted following the release of the findings of the EY review broadly agreed to EY's review recommendations, including recommendations 5 to 9, which directly relate to the governance of the Organ and Tissue Authority. The EY review states that the strategic oversight of DonateLife Network as well as the performance monitoring, succession planning and mentoring of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        could be improved through the establishment of a board of governance. Further, the establishment of a board of governance will foster and encourage a culture of debate within the Organ and Tissue Authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill seeks to establish the Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Board under the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation Transplantation Authority Act 2008 (the act). The board will take on the functions currently vested in the CEO under the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplant Authority Act 2008, including assuming the role as the accountable authority under the Public Governance, Performance and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Accountability Act
        </a>
        2013 (the PGPA Act). Establishing the board as the decision-making body and accountable authority under the PGPA Act will ensure that the perspectives of the organ and tissue donation and transplantation sector are taken into account in succession planning, in overseeing the work of DonateLife Network and in setting the key policy and strategic directions for the Organ and Tissue Authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CEO, whose primary role will be to oversee the day-to-day administration of the Organ and Tissue Authority, will be appointed by the minister in consultation with the board. The CEO will also be a member of the board. This arrangement has been instituted to improve operational efficacy of the Organ and Tissue Authority and will ensure that the strategic and policy objectives of the authority are efficiently integrated in the day-to-day operations and activities. To ensure that the Organ and Tissue Authority remains agile and responsive in a highly complex sector, the board may also delegate some of its functions to the CEO.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill retains the ability for the Commonwealth minister to give policy principles to the authority about the performance of its functions. The board will have skills based membership harnessing expertise, experience and knowledge from a broad range of areas, including public administration, business or management; clinical expertise in organ and tissue donation or transplantation; health promotion; community leadership; and health consumer issues. In line with the EY review recommendations, the Commonwealth will nominate the chair of the board. The jurisdictions will nominate the deputy chair, with the remaining five board members to be nominated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        Health Council. All board members will be appointed by the Commonwealth minister. This arrangement will support Australia's nationally consistent and coordinated approach to organ and tissue donation and transplantation.
       </p>
       <p>
        While there are no existing non-corporate Commonwealth entities currently adopting this model, we are confident that this arrangement is best for the Organ and Tissue Authority and the organ and tissue sector going forward. The act will be amended to abolish the advisory council but leave intact the provisions relating to organ and tissue donation and transplantation, such as formulating and disseminating policies and standards, supporting clinical training and community education, and providing financial assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this point I would also like to acknowledge the valuable work that the advisory council has done since its establishment. The establishment of the Organ and Tissue Authority Board will improve accountability and transparency and will better support the authority to more effectively achieve its strategic goals: saving lives and improving the quality of lives of more Australians. I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
