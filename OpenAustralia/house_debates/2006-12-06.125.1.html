       <p>
        I would like to update the House on recent developments to surf-lifesaving programs at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronulla_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Cronulla Beach
        </a>
        , in my electorate of Cook. The people of Cronulla and the rest of the Sutherland shire were faced with a significant challenge after December last year to unite against violence and intolerance and to work together to send the message that our beaches are there for everybody. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        , Mr Robb, has been a great support on this issue. I thank him for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year a partnership was announced between DIMA, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire Council
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        . This partnership is called On the Same Wave. I was very pleased to launch the On the Same Wave program for this summer at Wanda surf club, only two weeks ago. I was joined there by Tom Zreika, President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Muslim_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Lebanese Muslim Association
        </a>
        , who is doing a fantastic job in that role. He has promoted the need for cohesion admirably. He is a great role model for young people of Muslim faith in south-western Sydney and indeed more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a practical sense, On the Same Wave is enhancing the awareness of surf-lifesaving and beach safety in culturally diverse communities and allowing surf-lifesaving clubs to diversify their membership. At the recent launch of the summer program I observed students from Oatley Senior High School Georges River campus undertaking a surf survival certificate. This training has been successfully linked to the year 11 sport curriculum and goes towards fulfilling a part of these students’ vocational education and training. This month Granville Boys High School students from Islander and Arabic-speaking backgrounds are coming down to Cronulla for similar training.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the school holiday period, Surf Life Saving New South Wales is working with Bankstown, Blacktown, Auburn and Hurstville councils and their youth services to make possible surf awareness days for young people who come from culturally diverse backgrounds. Further to these planned events, there will be two general surf awareness days in January for the general public, one in my electorate, at Elouera, and one at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bondi" rel="nofollow">
         North Bondi
        </a>
        . It is clear that all involved in this program are making great strides in breaking down cultural barriers in key areas of Sydney and building mutual respect and understanding on a wide level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks must go to Surf Life Saving New South Wales Diversity Manager Suzie Stollznow, who is doing a fantastic job of building this project from the ground up. It has been amazing to see the way in which she has just grabbed the program, sensed the vision and gone for it. My thanks also go to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Vanessa Brown
        </a>
        at Surf Life Saving New South Wales and the harmony officers at DIMA. I would also like to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        , who work very hard for our local community under very difficult circumstances. Finally, to the backbone of the enduring surf culture at Cronulla—that is, the four surf clubs and their presidents—I also extend my thanks. The community is sending a clear message this summer that our beaches are there for all of us to share.
