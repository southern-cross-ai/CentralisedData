       <p>
        I want to ensure that the seat of Fisher is the place to be for education, employment and retirement. This mission is the driving force behind the campaigns that I fight for at a local level and defines much of my advocacy with my ministerial colleagues here in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my 14 months as the member for Fisher, I've been able to deliver many successful projects to enhance the lifestyle of my constituents, such as funding for upgrades to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        and funding for the Thompson Institute and the Events Centre Caloundra. These local wins have certainly been immensely rewarding, and I know that the broader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        population will benefit from such unprecedented federal spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being able to deliver a project that provides outcomes in all three areas of education, employment and retirement was therefore a very proud moment for me. Just last week, my colleague Ted O'Brien and I welcomed the federal Minister for Health and Minister for Sport,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Hunt
        </a>
        , and the Assistant Minister for Health,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gillespie" rel="nofollow">
         David Gillespie
        </a>
        , at the new Sunshine Coast University Hospital to formalise the agreement with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        to establish our very own medical school, with 50 Commonwealth-supported places to commence in September 2019. Two students from the Fisher electorate, Carlos Brady from Kawana Waters State College and Jack Gaffney from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_College" rel="nofollow">
         Unity College
        </a>
        , attended the formalisation ceremony last week. Each of them have expressed an interest in studying medicine at the medical school when it opens. Both of these young students shared their excitement that this facility would be right on their doorstep, allowing them to remain living at home whilst continuing their studies. Being supported by their families during this intense and, at times, stressful period of their lives will no doubt be vital to their success.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that graduating doctors are more likely to remain living in the region where they've studied. This partnership agreement with Griffith will have a long-term impact on employment opportunities on the Sunshine Coast. I am passionate about finding ways we can offer meaningful employment for our community, and this is certainly one way we can achieve this.
       </p>
       <p>
        As much as the coast is experiencing growth in young families, we are also seeing an increase in our ageing population. Not surprisingly, more and more people are choosing to retire to the coast for the relaxed lifestyle and ideal weather conditions. Knowing that the coast will have increased services, by way of additional medically-trained professionals and a state-of-the-art hospital and teaching facility, no doubt provides peace of mind that they will be well cared for into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank my colleague Ted O'Brien who worked so hard with me to secure this fantastic outcome. I would also particularly like to thank the health minister and assistant health minister and Griffith University for their help in achieving this goal.
