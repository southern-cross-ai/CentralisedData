        I rise today to pay tribute to and to congratulate the Ascot Park Bowling Club within the electorate of Hindmarsh. Yesterday I had great pleasure in attending the 50-year anniversary of the bowling club. There were well over 100 people in attendance from many of the clubs in the surrounding areas. In attendance as well was the Mayor of the City of Marion, Mayor Felicity Lewis. Local councillor Irene Wenham, who is a very hardworking councillor for her ward, was also there. She is a great supporter of local communities in and around her ward in the electorate of Hindmarsh and in the City of Marion. Mary Lou Corcoran was also there representing the state member of parliament, the Hon.

        I would like to pay tribute to the club for their 50 years of contribution to the area. The club was started more than 50 years ago with an idea of forming a bowling green in the backyard of a particular person that had an interest in bowls. From there, the idea grew and eventually it moved to the premises where it is now and has been for 50 years. Think of the 50 years that the Ascot Park Bowling Club has been there and the contribution it has given and the lives it has touched. Yesterday just looking at the club’s honours board, I saw there were hundreds of names of past presidents and secretaries. The club has touched many lives, contributed to the community atmosphere and provided exercise to members getting together once or twice a week by having a game of bowls and enjoying each other’s company.

        Great fun was had by all yesterday. Of course, President Paul Herreen was there. He is a very hardworking president. Currently, they are looking at renewing the building and getting some building works done to modernise the place. As I have said, the club rooms were built 50 years ago and they were built in bits and pieces as the club grew. We are looking at ensuring that we do all that we can to support them to get some funding—whether it be from local, state or federal government—so they can realise their plan. They have planned many special events throughout this year for their 50th anniversary. As I have said, one of those projects will be to commence the rebuilding of the club rooms. These facilities have been built in various stages over the years, but I am sure that, with the leadership of Paul Herreen as president and secretary

        and others, they will realise their dream and continue to service the community for many, many more years, whether it be through sporting events such as
