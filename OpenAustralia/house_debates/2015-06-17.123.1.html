        I rise to speak on the wonderful recent gap announcement made by the Minister for Social Services, the Honourable Scott Morrison. By way of background, last year the government undertook a competitive tender process under the

        New Way of Working for Grants scheme for organisations seeking funding under an $800-million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        grants round to support a broad range of vital front-line services. These services that support communities around Australia included families, seniors, Indigenous, and culturally and linguistically diverse Australians as well as some of our most vulnerable. The department had received more than 5,500 applications. In December last year the department advised the outcome to the applicants.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the electorate of Macquarrie, this left gaps in service delivery in both the Hawkesbury and in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        , which raised grave concerns for many community services. I made representations to the minister as well as spoke with him directly regarding the gaps in service delivery and voiced my concerns along with the concerns of the community. I wish to acknowledge the minister's willingness to hear the concerns of this community as well as others, and his prompt action to provide new bridging funding till 30 June this year to ensure continuity of these vital front-line community services. This was good news for LINCS, Richmond Community Services and Gateway Family Services and the people that they serve.
       </p>
       <p>
        I continued to work with the minister, who also did not want to see critical community services fall between the cracks beyond 30 June. With that, the minister commissioned a comprehensive gap analysis. On 10 June this year, I was delighted to be advised that Mr Morrison announced the Abbott government will invest an extra $40 million into more than 100 front-line community services across Australia following the gap analysis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Making the phone calls to LINCS, Richmond Community Services and to Gateway Family Services to advise them that they had just received funding for two additional years until 30 June 2017 was extremely gratifying. The extension of funding will see LINCS receive $142,186 $106, Richmond community Services receive $168,140 and Gateway Family Services receive $288,430.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to particularly thank Carolyn Byers of LINCS, Yatra Sherwood from Richmond Community Services and Kerry Thomas of Gateway Family Services for working with me as we advocated on behalf of our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dedication and passion that LINCS provides in delivering to the people of the Hawkesbury is immeasurable
       </p>
       <p>
        LINCS have been operating for some 17 years and, except for one employee, they are all volunteersâ€”caring men and women who have helped several hundred families during this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Carolyn Byers, a LINCS volunteer since 2000, tells me that she has personally seen the benefits of this program for those who occasionally experience, as she calls it, 'hiccups' in life. She talked about struggling families who require additional assistance. Her volunteers are able to provide care for their children so they can access that help. Carolyn goes on to say that it is a privilege to be given this trust from the families and to have the capacity to care for their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The LINCS early intervention program tackles matters like a lack of parenting skills before they become greater issues. This is a preventative model. Each family is given two hours per week in home visiting time. There are some 21 volunteers as well as the management committee who volunteer for the service in both managing and performing home visitations. I cannot thank the LINCS volunteers enough for the time, dedication and passion they give so selflessly in serving the Hawkesbury community. It was more than a pleasure to be able to advocate on their behalf for this gap funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, Richmond Community Services have served the Hawkesbury community through programs such as Tools for Parents. This program was born over nine years ago, identified as need for the area. The service provides free child care for parents, removing barriers and enabling them to participate in the program wholly and without distraction. The program assists families with parenting skills, offering classes in dealing with conflicts and bullying. The executive officer of Richmond Community Services, Yatra Sherwood, said that, when you have the certainty of two years' extra funding, it enables you to foster intergenerational change.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge the Blue Mountains Gateway Family Services and Kerry Thomas, her volunteers and staff for all they do to serve the people of the Blue Mountains.
