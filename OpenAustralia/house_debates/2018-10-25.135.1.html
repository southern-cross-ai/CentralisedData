        Invictus is Latin for unconquered, and it embodies the fighting spirit and resilience of our service personnel. Like all honourable members, I've been very impressed with the

        this week that are still continuing. The Invictus Games in a marvellous event for wounded, injured and ill servicemen and servicewomen. It is for those who are still on active duties and also for veterans. The games use the healing power of sport to aid recovery, support rehabilitation and to generation a wider understanding and respect for those who serve their country. The Invictus Games also recognise the critical role played by families and friends. From all accounts, it's been a wonderful atmosphere up there in Sydney, with a lot of healing, a lot of exhaustion and some fantastic results.

        This year's games have a number of Territorians in the Australian team who are doing us proud. I want to recognise them. I had the privilege of meeting Corporal Sonya Newman recently. She is a very impressive person. Sonya joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">

        in 1999, and then became a member of the permanent Army in 2002. She's currently posted to the 1st Combat Service Support Battalionâ€”ICSSB. Sonya has competed already in the sitting volleyball and swimming. She's bagged a heap of medals: silver in the women's 4 x 50 metres freestyle relay and gold in the women's 100 metres freestyle, gold in the 50 metres backstroke, gold in the women's 50 metres breaststroke, and gold in the women's 50 metres freestyle. Samantha Gould joined the Army in 2007 and has been posted to both

        Kanimbla and Choules. She deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 and is now discharged from the Army. She's been competing in powerlifting and wheelchair tennis. Sam lifted 66 kilograms in the powerlifting and, with her tennis partner, Jamie Tanner, made it through to the semifinals. Well done also to

        , who got gold in the backstroke, breaststroke and 50 metres freestyle relay, and to Matthew Paine, who's going to be competing in the wheelchair basketball. We wish him well for the next couple of days. Well done to everyone at Invictus and all the best for Netherlands 2020.
