       <p>
        On behalf of the Assistant Minister to the Minister for the Public Service, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That, in accordance with the provisions of the
        <i>

         Committee Act 1969
        </i>
        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        Mid-Term Refresh Programâ€”

        </a>
        Cairns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The aim of the Department of Defence North Queensland Mid-Term Refresh Program is to meet essential short-term base sustainment needs at three defence bases in North Queensland. It is proposed to achieve this by providing vital estate maintenance and upgrades to support capability at all three sites.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bases are experiencing critical issues, such as ageing and inadequate infrastructure and noncompliance with infrastructure standards, and no longer meet all current work, health and safety requirements. Unless these are addressed, there is a risk that the facilities and the infrastructure will be increasingly less able to support current levels of capability. The estimated cost of the program is $111.2 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 15 April 2021. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval the works are expected to commence from late 2021 and be completed by late 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.

        Question agreed to.
