Two six-year-old boys were playing in the surf when they were suddenly knocked off their bodyboards and became stuck in a rip that was rapidly sweeping them out to sea. The boys saw this happen and immediately headed out to help them. They paddled for over 150 metres to get to them. Oliver and Ned got to the boys first and, with Charlie's help, got them onto the front of their surfboards. Max and Sol then helped the boys get them back into shore as, with the extra weight on their boards, they didn't have much flotation.

        winner. Janet Irwin is from Grafton and she loves to paint. Her passion for art began in grade 1, when she won first prize at the Grafton Show. Janet has Sotos syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. She says art makes her happy because it helps her deal with some of the challenges she faces. Janet says her disability makes her more creative in her artwork, because she can get very focused on certain things. She attends

Janet and the school's leader of additional needs, Meg Bindon, produced an accompanying video for the entry. Congratulations, Janet. You are an inspiration to us all.

Veronica Silver jointly received the Sporting Achievement Award for her dedication in fundraising for the Alstonville Water Polo Club for the last 20 years. The Arts/Cultural Award went to the Ballina and District Historical Society. The museum opened to the public in October 2021 and has been developed solely by the volunteers. And the Senior Citizen of the Year went to Barry Fiedler. I know Barry very well; he volunteers for numerous local community organisations. This includes 60 years with the Pearces Creek Hall and seven years with the Alstonville Tibouchina Day Club. Congratulations, Barry.
