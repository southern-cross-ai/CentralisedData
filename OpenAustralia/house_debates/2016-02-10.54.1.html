       <p>
        Today there are reports that the Turnbull government is not committed to a two per cent growth in defence spending. The reports raise questions about how many submarines will be built if and when the government finally makes a decision about them. Yesterday,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
         ASC
        </a>
        confirmed that 1,300 shipbuilders will lose their jobs over the next two years. Last week, there were also reports that there was a question mark hanging over South Australia's participation in the construction of the previously promised offshore patrol vessels. Those concerns were reinforced in Senate estimates questions yesterday. The loss of 1,300 shipbuilders at ASC will result in the loss of skills and the loss of capability at ASC that could be lost forever. The losses will come on top of the 1,665 shipyard jobs that have been lost since this government came into office. It is the third year into this government's term, and, after 148 days in office by Prime Minister Turnbull, we still do not know how many submarines will be built, where they will be built or who will build them. In fact, since being elected in 2013, this government has not awarded a single major contract to an Australian shipbuilder. The delays and uncertainty are causing the demise of Australia's naval shipbuilding industry and the loss of thousands of Australian jobs.
