       <p>
        by leave—In rising to speak again in this debate I would first like to compliment the member for Newcastle on her fine contribution to the debate, raising the issue of alcopops and the enormous impact that the failure by the Senate to pass that legislation will have. I know that Newcastle is an electorate where there have been a number of problems with young people binge drinking, and that has created enormous issues in the electorate. The member for Newcastle has been out there fighting to see that programs are introduced in the electorate to ensure that this phenomenon is addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an issue that is having an enormous impact on young people throughout Australia. I must say that I am very disappointed that the opposition failed to support the government’s legislation when the AMA is supporting it and every leading health authority in the area is saying that this issue is of such great importance. Binge drinking is an issue that has the potential to basically wipe out a generation of young people. To think that the opposition would not pass this measure and would not seriously consider the enormous impact that alcopops are having! Alcopops are the vehicle for introducing young people, and particularly young girls, to alcohol. Any member of this House can visit areas in their electorate where young people congregate, and they will see young people drinking alcopops. They will see the effect that they have on young people. And, if they were to track the lives of some of those young people who have developed a dependency on alcohol through the introduction of alcopops, they would then have to live with the consequence of not supporting this legislation.

          The alcopops legislation was one attack on the issue. The member opposite commented on the seriousness of the approach. If it was not a measure that was worth supporting, why did all leading health experts support the legislation? Why did they—

            <p>
             almost unanimously say that this was good legislation and it was legislation that both sides of the parliament should support? Why was it that the opposition chose to ignore the voices of those health experts who see the long-term impact that alcohol has in our hospitals and who can see on a daily basis that the impact that alcohol has on young people is much greater than that of illicit drugs?
            </p>
            <p>
             People on the other side of this House, the opposition, will argue until they are blue in the face against supplying illicit drugs, with a particular emphasis on young people. I would say to them: this is a drug that they have an ability to control. This is a drug that has far greater impact on the lives of young people. Because the opposition have failed to support this legislation, they have failed the young people of Australia, and the consequences will become apparent. I ask them to go back, think about it and make a decision to support the legislation.
