       <p>
        There has been discussion for some time about the role of the Speaker and about the place of a so-called independent Speakership. I think it would be helpful to provide members and others with some perspective from the
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Speakership has evolved in its own way since Federation in 1901 and now differs in significant ways from the office of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the United Kingdom House of Commons
        </a>
        . I quote from the
        <i>
         Practice
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … in the House of Commons the Speaker abandons all party loyalties and is required to be impartial on all party issues both inside and outside the House. In concert with this requirement the principle has been well established that the Speaker continues in office, regardless of a change of government, until ceasing to be a Member of the House.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In contrast, practice in the House of Representatives has been to change the Speaker with a change of government … This provides a Speaker who is politically affiliated but who is required to be impartial in the Chair, rather than a Speaker who is both independent and seen to be independent. Historically, the Speaker has not been required to sever his or her connection with the governing party. Speakers have attended party meetings and have not, of necessity, refrained from election campaigning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Previous Speakers have certainly attended party meetings. The only reason for nonattendance in the 43rd Parliament was a condition of the 2010 Labor-Greens agreement to facilitate minority government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opposition members: That's not true!
       </p>
       <p>
        You will be quiet. I am making a statement. Again quoting the
        <i>
         Practice
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2010 changes to the standing orders explicitly permitted the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to participate in private Members' business. It is otherwise unusual for a Speaker to participate in a debate. Although there is no standing order which prohibits such participation and there have been instances where this has happened, such action in the modern House would be regarded as out of character with the status and role of the Speaker unless the matter under debate was of a peculiarly parliamentary nature falling within the responsibilities of the Speaker
       </p>
       <p>
        I trust this provides some perspective on how I see my role as Speaker in light of the proud Australian tradition of Speakership which is in conformity with the
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        .
