        I rise this evening to support a motion that was presented today in the Senate by Senator the Hon.

        . Over four million people have become Australian citizens since 1949, and as I stand here today over 95 per cent of Australia’s residents are Australian citizens. We have 95 per cent of Australians who want to look forward to the future, who have a vision not just for this nation but for their family and for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was in 2001 that the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon.

        , announced that 17 September would be Citizenship Day. Citizenship Day is a day we celebrate what it means to be Australian and reflect on the importance of Australian citizenship. It was the coalition that acknowledged the importance of celebrating our nation’s diversity and the wealth created by it. I speak on a daily basis with many people from many nations—in fact, over 140 nationalities are represented in my electorate. They have chosen to call Australia home. This is a huge decision for many of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the period 2006-07, over 169,000 people from over 176 countries became Australian citizens. I will mention the top 10 nationalities that chose to call Australia home. They include people from the United Kingdom, India, the People’s Republic of China,

        , the

        </a>
        , the Philippines, Sudan, Malaysia, Afghanistan and Vietnam. All these people have chosen to officially become part of the Australian family.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Redhage" rel="nofollow">

        is one such person who has become an Australian citizen. Shawn proudly represented Australia in the basketball at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Beijing Olympics
        </a>
        . When Shawn was asked why he became an Australian citizen he replied:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think becoming a citizen makes me feel more a part of this country. It’s a huge honour to be able to help uphold the values Australia has created and what the country stands for.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure you will agree, Mr Speaker, that Shawn encapsulates what it means to be an Australian citizen.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition also believes it is important to pay tribute to all those who have made Australia what it is today and who have and will continue to contribute towards building its future. Australia is built on foundations that include respecting our cultural diversity, believing in the right to a democratic society, respecting the rights and liberties of fellow Australians, the commitment to upholding and obeying our laws and, most importantly, upholding the loyalty to Australia and her people.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Citizenship Day 2007 Australia’s new citizenship test was launched along with a resource book to help those wishing to become citizens understand our values, our history and our culture. So that new migrants had assistance when preparing for the test, $13.9 million was invested. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in April this year said the results of the latest snapshot of tests would be considered by an independent committee which would ‘examine all aspects of the content and operation of the citizenship test’. He went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the committee’s role will be to examine the experiences of people who sat the test and determine whether other potential candidates are being deterred from the test.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some concerns. I am concerned because statistics show 95 per cent of all candidates pass their test whether it is their first attempt or an additional attempt. Watering down or scrapping the test altogether would not be beneficial for our nation, nor would it be helpful for people who wish to officially become Australian citizens, but I do call on the current government to ensure that all potential citizens are given every assistance that they require to be able to sit and successfully pass that test. Citizenship Day is extremely important for our nation and our citizens. It is a day when as Australians we come together to celebrate our Aussie uniqueness as well as reflect on our country’s diversity, democracy, values and responsibilities. As a coalition we believe that every Australian has the right to freedom of choice, an environment that will make their dreams a reality and confidence to build for their future. The coalition’s values are reflected in the values of Australian citizenship and they should not be taken for granted.
