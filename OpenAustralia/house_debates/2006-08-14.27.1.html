       <p>
        On the Saturday before parliament resumed its sitting I spent a couple of hours at Innaloo shopping centre in my electorate. I spoke to a constituent, whose name I will not use because I have not sought her permission to do so. My constituent lives in Yokine. She contracted polio as a child and, as a result, needs to travel by means of an ultralight scooter.
       </p>
       <p>
        She asked me for help with a matter. She is travelling from Sydney to Canberra on a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CountryLink" rel="nofollow">

        train service and was charged double to travel with her scooter, which I think is an extraordinarily mean-spirited policy. I contacted CountryLink about this and they said their policy is that, if somebody buys a ticket for themselves and then has to travel with a scooter or a wheelchair, they are charged for the extra seat. I think that is extraordinary and I will be contacting the

        Minister for Transport,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Watkins" rel="nofollow">
         John Watkins
        </a>
        , to ask that he reconsider such a mean-spirited policy. I do acknowledge that, in this instance, CountryLink did say they would refund the ticket to my constituent.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I am concerned that this policy continues to exist, and I will be lobbying very hard for it to be changed. I think it is an extraordinarily mean-spirited policy that could not save CountryLink more than a couple of thousand dollars a year. I call upon the New South Wales government to change it.
