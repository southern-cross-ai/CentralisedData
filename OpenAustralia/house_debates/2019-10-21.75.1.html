        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that none of the eight Victorian projects listed under the Roads of Strategic Importance fund have even reached the planning stage?

         I thank the member for her question, and I will ask the minister for infrastructure to add to this answer. On Friday I was pleased to sit down with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of Victoria
         </a>
         . For the last several months I have been working closely with the Premier of Victoria, as has the minister for congestion busting—more formally known as the minister for urban infrastructure—and the minister for infrastructure has been sitting down with all of our state and territory colleagues to ensure that we both bring forward projects and get the time lines and agreements set. This has also involved the provision of additional funds invested, in particular, in Victoria. I've been very pleased to work closely with the Premier of Victoria and to make so much progress to ensure that both governments can work together to deliver these projects in the years ahead. The opposition may want to engage in the theatre of politics on these matters, but the Premier of Victoria and I are engaging in the business of delivery of infrastructure projects in Victoria. I'll invite the minister for infrastructure to add to my answer.

          I thank the Prime Minister for allowing me to add to his answer. I thank the member for Jagajaga; I am always happy to have you come down and get a personal briefing from me about projects in your area. That goes for all those in the opposition; I am always happy to chat about our $100 billion infrastructure pipeline and what we're doing individually in each and every one of your own electorates. There have been plenty of takers, and I'm thankful that the member for Bendigo has taken the time, effort and trouble to come to me and ask about what's going on in her rural Victorian electorate. Indeed, just last week,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinta_Allan" rel="nofollow">
           Jacinta Allan
          </a>
          , the infrastructure and roads minister in Victoria, talked glowingly in question time about the relationship between the Commonwealth and the state government on getting on with infrastructure projects in Victoria. We will continue to make sure that we roll out infrastructure. Indeed, as far as urban congestion is going, the government has committed funding to 26 projects in Victoria—this is excluding commuter car parks—totalling $874.9 million. The member who asked the question—it looks like she's too busy talking to another member there—

              We are getting on with planning. We're working with the Victorian government. You can't build these things overnight; I know the member opposite thought he built the pyramids overnight. In the member's electorate, there is the M80 Ring Road upgrade, the

               North East Link

              , and the south eastern roads and northern roads projects. They're the sorts of things we're getting on with to benefit Jagajaga and to benefit Victorians.
