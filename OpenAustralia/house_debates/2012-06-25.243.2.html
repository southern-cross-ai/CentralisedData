        I believe that one of the most important roles I have as a member of parliament is to listen to the needs and concerns of my community and then work tirelessly to address these issues and do whatever I can to make Macarthur a better place for all my constituents to live in. This why I recently distributed Macarthur's Biggest Survey to every household in my electorate. I have received a great response from many residents—families, seniors and small business owners—in the Macarthur region. Almost 2,000 surveys have been returned so far, which is great because it means I am able to see and hear firsthand the needs and concerns of my community and do what I can to address these issues. Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has taken the time to fill out their survey and send it back. I would also like to remind other residents that they can still do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with my staff, we are still working very hard to process all the data from these surveys, but I can safely say that the two major issues raised by residents in Macarthur have been the Labor-Greens toxic carbon tax and the need for better infrastructure in the region. Touching on infrastructure, this includes upgrades to our roads, public transport system, hospitals and recreational facilities; access to education; and more employment opportunities within the region. One of the biggest concerns raised so far is the rapid growth of housing developments in our area, with no accompanying investment to enhance the level of infrastructure, particularly roads, parking and public transport. Locals would also like to see more facilities for youth, such as recreational parks or centres, and more training opportunities for employment. These are great suggestions considering that many of the new housing developments in the region will primarily be homes for young families. The people of Macarthur are on the pulse with these issues and are well aware that the population is expected to double in the next two decades. The Camden Local Government Area alone is predicted to balloon to a massive 390 per cent by 2036, with about 250,000 more residents moving into the area. This compares with 62 per cent growth in Wollondilly and 59 per cent for Campbelltown.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital that the infrastructure required for new and existing residents in my community be provided before the growth occurs so that my electorate remains strong and resilient as it grows. That is why I was very surprised to see that Macarthur had been so neglected in this year's federal budget. But, luckily for the people of Macarthur, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state Liberal government is working hard to improve infrastructure in our region to ensure that present and future residents have adequate infrastructure and services to support this growth. This year's state budget included $26.6 million to continue the Campbelltown Hospital redevelopment; $29 million to start the upgrade of Camden Valley between Ingleburn and Raby Road; $9.5 million to complete planning for the upgrade between Raby Road and Oran Park Drive; $900,000 to start the

        and

         Camden Valley Way
        </a>
        ; $393,000 for the Camden Court House upgrade; an upgrade of Picton Railway Station; $37.8 million for a priority sewerage program at Appin, Bargo, Buxton and Wilton; $5.4 million for 85 more nurses in south-west Sydney; $3 million to purchase land for new accommodation for people with disabilities in Campbelltown; $214,000 to build a new entrance to the Dharawal National Park in Appin; $11.8 million for road and program funding; $11.6 million for further

        </a>
        upgrades; and $6.4 million for more subacute mental health services. You can see that the state Liberal government really are kicking the can. The budget also includes a $30 million boost to its Local Government Infrastructure Renewal Scheme, which helps councils with the borrowing costs on loans to address infrastructure backlogs.

        First home buyers in Macarthur will also be $19,245 better off when they buy a new home under the new Building the State package to boost housing construction. This will also promote job creation and stimulate the local economy across the region. With so many homes now being built in Macarthur, this will be a great incentive to help young people buy their first home in my electorate. It will also encourage those from outside the area to build their new home in one of the many new estates in Macarthur such as Oran Park Town, Gregory Hills,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Farm" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Camden Estate and Ridges Estate in Elderslie.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the member for Wollondilly Jai Rowell, the member for Campbelltown Bryan Doyle, and the member for Camden Chris Patterson, for their hard work to support the people of Macarthur through their budget. It is interesting that all this investment has come after we got rid of a Labor government that invested nothing, or very little, in the Macarthur region over a 16-year period. I know that those local Liberal members fought hard for their communities and it is great to see the Premier and the New South Wales Treasurer funding so many projects across my electorate. Money spent on improvements to Macarthur's roads and public transport will help local communities plan—important, given that more than 75 per cent of Macarthur's population leave the area and commute to work on a daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have already mentioned in parliament the need for more employment lands in Macarthur so that people can live and work in what I consider to be one of the best places in the world. Until these employment lands are generated, we need adequate roads and public transport options for residents in my community who spend up to three or four hours a day commuting to and from work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Macarthur is a fantastic place to live and anything we can do to improve the life of residents in my community, especially when it comes to more time spent at home with their families, is a good thing. That is why I am very pleased to see the New South Wales government pouring so much funding into Macarthur's roads and public transport. The state budget also caters for major population growth in south-west Sydney, with $397 million set aside to continue work on the South West Rail Link between Glenfield and Leppington and $900,000 to kick start the widening of the M5. The South West Rail Link will be a major piece of public transport infrastructure for the south-west growth centre, connecting an existing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityRail" rel="nofollow">
         CityRail
        </a>
        network at Glenfield to the new train station at Leppington. This will provide another option for commuters from the Camden and Wollondilly areas who currently use Narellan Road to access train services from Campbelltown. The upgrades to Camden Valley Way and the South West Rail Link will take cars off Narellan Road and help to ease the congestion experienced by many motorists during peak hour times. This was another important issue brought up in Macarthur's Biggest Survey. I am constantly approached by residents in my electorate who want to vent their frustration about our local roads. That is why I think the state government's commitment to Macarthur's roads and infrastructure is a fantastic thing and vital as Macarthur's population continues to grow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Macarthur faces several high-priority infrastructure projects over the next two decades. These include better connectivity and access on our roads; better public transport, including commuter parking; development of employment generating lands for those that live and work in Macarthur; improved health, education and community facilities and services, such as upgrades to our hospitals, the university,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        , ambulance and police stations; better recreational facilities; access to water and sewerage; and better internet connection. The Spring Farm Parkway extension and the connection to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Hume Highway
        </a>
        , including on and off ramps to the Hume Highway at Menangle, are also high priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding provided by the state government towards some of these projects is a great start in dealing with the high-priority infrastructure needs identified for Macarthur, although I am sure many would agree that federal funding is also needed to support this growth. This funding is distinctly lacking. I am sure it can be appreciated that, with a forecast of 300 per cent growth in the next two to three decades, it is vital that a region-wide strategy is developed for Macarthur to deal with the expected population boom. I believe that all three levels of government must work together to establish this plan for our community's future. I am sure that, with good planning and collaboration to secure resources, we can turn the challenges of growth into opportunities for economic prosperity, social equity and environmental enhancement—all crucial in determining our quality of life. A major factor we must deal with as Macarthur's population continues to grow is infrastructure: planning for it, securing the resources to pay for it and ensuring that it is delivered on time in the right place and on budget—something this government has problems with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with many Macarthur residents, I am pleased to see that the New South Wales state government has funded these important infrastructure projects and hope to see more federal funding poured into the region over the next two decades to support this growth. I also look forward to hearing from more residents in my community as returns from Macarthur's Biggest Survey continue to be returned to my office each day. It is vital that I hear from the people of Macarthur first-hand so that I can continue to fight for the infrastructure we need to make Macarthur a great place to live for many generations to come.
