        There are some wonderful schools in my electorate of Blair, which covers Ipswich and the Somerset region. But tonight I would like to tell you about just one of them: St Edmund's Christian Brothers' College, which has a student body of about 950 young men. The secondary school is located in the inner-Ipswich suburb of Woodend. Last Saturday night I attended—as I usually do—the

        Foundation annual dinner. Firstly, I will give a bit of background about St Eddie's. It is located on a hill in Ipswich, where for generations young Aboriginal men experienced initiation ceremonies. Today young men—both Indigenous and non-Indigenous—are initiated into the culture of St Eddie's and become what is known as 'Eddie's men'—kind men, gentle men and compassionate men.

        community—young men and young women—across the heart of Ipswich. The original building was St Mary's Christian Brothers' College. From that time until 1961 there was a demand for a secondary education facility for the young men of Ipswich. Building commenced near St Mary's Christian Brothers' College soon thereafter. The first completed building was blessed by Reverend James Duhig, who was responsible for many, many of the churches in Brisbane and Ipswich and the surrounds, and who was then

        St Eddie's has the most wonderful Indigenous mural inside its hall, which is where the dinner was held. Last year the mural was unveiled by Uncle Joe Kirk, its designer and interpreter. Joe works as a mentor with students from St Edmund's College,

        in Ipswich, using a literacy and numeracy approach he designed to educate young people in traditional language, culture, music and spirituality. I am pleased to say the former federal Labor government's commitment to education with 'St Eddies' was clearly demonstrated by the Ipswich Region Trade Training Centre, a $3 million commitment that

        and

        </a>
        participated in.
       </p>
       <p>
        That trade training centre boasts an automotive garage, a world class facility that is used to train mechanics, carpenters, and brick layers of the future, in the Ipswich and the West Moreton region. St Edmund's College recently appointed former old boy Chris Leadbetter as its principal, upon the retirement of Brendan Lawler, who had been principal for nine years. Chris has big shoes to fill, but it is already evident that he is more than up to the job. I congratulate and commend Brendan for the commitment he made to the spirituality and education of young men in Ipswich.

        St Edmund's College is very much a part of the Ipswich community, and that is obvious from the fact that 320 people attended the event. St Edmund's College has produced many fine men who have made contributions to our community, our culture and our country, including Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale and former Wallaby great Paul McLean
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who were both present on the evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Foundation Dinner is ably run by the St Edmund's College Foundation, and it raises tens of thousands of dollars every year. St Edmund's College has a long commitment to social justice, equality of opportunity, and help for Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander

        youth, and particularly disadvantaged students in the region. But its commitment is also demonstrated by its program Footprints in the Park, where teachers, students and parents help provide nourishment to homeless and disadvantaged people in the Ipswich community. Those fortnightly meals take place at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Park" rel="nofollow">

        in Ipswich central.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dinner is sponsored by Brothers Leagues Club, and I want to make particular mention of general manager Mark Henley, who is a 'St Eddies' old boy who has made a significant contribution to Ipswich and the greater community. Well known speakers are usually there, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_O'Brien" rel="nofollow">
         Kerry O'Brien
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kekovich" rel="nofollow">

        , and this year ABC commentator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_O'Keeffe" rel="nofollow">
         Kerry O'Keeffe
        </a>
        , whose exploits in the field and his comedy in the media have kept us entertained for a long time. He has a very instinctive, distinctive and infectious laugh.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend St Edmund's Christian Brothers College, and the foundation, for their commitment to the Ipswich community, and for their annual foundation dinner. Chris Leadbetter's joke that night as to why he did not pursue a career as a test cricketer was extraordinary to hear. Everyone had a great night of fun, fellowship and laughter, and I am looking forward to next year's event. Congratulations 'St Eddies'. You are a great school and you have made a great contribution to the people of Ipswich.
