       <p>
        Today I would like to celebrate two wonderful charity events organised in the Goldstein electorate. The first one, at the Pantry Party in Brighton, was to raise money for Very Special Kids. It was started a few years ago by Guy Mainwarring after Very Special Kids helped him and his wife, Juliet, in a difficult time when they were nursing their late son, Gus, after he was diagnosed with Batten's disease. In the grounds of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew's_Church" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        on Saturday morning they raised $47,312 for this year. Particular thanks go to Dan Vaughn, from the Pantry Party, for his support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to say thanks to everybody who was involvedâ€”including

        , for his hosting, Tweety bird, Bugs Bunny and

        . And I have to say that Felicity Frederico did look particularly good in her pig costume! Of course, I did my bit as well: I was dunked on Saturday morning, but I will say that I am a little disturbed by Matthew Paynter's decision to pay 400 bucks for the privilege!

        Secondly, I would like to congratulate those involved in the Riding for Good bike ride, which is an important charity raising money for Sandringham Hospital. It is biennial, raising $150,000 in 2015. This year they raised another $113,000, taking total funds raised to half a million bucks for the Sandy hospital. They ride from

        to Mordialloc. The event was opened by Judy Reeves, from Sandy hospital, and me. It was a wonderful charity event and I want to thank the organising team: Alistair Murray,
