       <p>
        Today, as part of the Girls Takeover Parliament Program, 60 young women came into this nation's parliament to experience the work of federal politicians. They've undertaken activities such as attending meetings and events, to see the inner workings of parliament and learn of some of the responsibilities of politicians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite women comprising more than 50 per cent of the population, only 30 per cent of parliamentarians are women. This program provides a space to make girls and young women visible and to have their voices heard. It allows girls and young women to see that there are opportunities for them to engage in politics and actively participate in our democracy. Through 'taking over' some of the responsibilities of politicians—including writing this speech—they learn ways to be leaders and see that they, too, can have a place in politics.

        My office is hosting a young woman, Kifan, who is an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">

        student studying computer science. Kifan has been following me around today. It's great to see so many young women like Kifan at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        today. I hope that this program will continue to inspire and support young women and continue to work towards a more equal gender representation in Australian politics. Some might suggest that it would be a more pleasant parliament, a less confrontational parliament, if there were a greater representation of women on both sides of the chamber and in all political parties.
