        I rise to speak about the agreement between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_West_Torrens" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and crows football club to redevelop
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebarton_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Thebarton Oval
        </a>
        as a new home for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Crows" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Crows
        </a>
        . There's no doubt that everyone's relieved that finally the crows have a home, but it hasn't been without concern from some of the residents. Primarily this is because residents are extremely concerned that the development will lead to the loss of open space in the area and particularly in Kings Reserve, which is the oval adjacent to it. I know that the council is working very hard with the residents to make sure that all concerns are heard. I can understand how many residents are concerned by this. It's important to note the impact that Kings Reserve will have on groups that currently use it, like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA" rel="nofollow">
         MA
        </a>
        Hawks soccer club, which is one of the local clubs in my electorate. That's why it's vital, and I urge both parties to continue consultation and communication. The residents want to see open space remaining. We've had some commitment from the council that that will be the case. It's also so important that all opinions are listened to respectfully and that information is transparent and ongoing.
       </p>
       <p>
        This development could be an opportunity for a wonderful open space for the residents, which we currently have, but also for ensuring that the current footprint of open space remains and that consultation with the council continues.
