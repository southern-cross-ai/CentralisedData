        government has been elected TAFE colleges in my area have come under siege. They have pressure on them to deliver expenditure cuts, which has resulted in 35 courses being cut in the Hunter. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table those courses that have been cut in the Hunter.

        I thank the House. I am very worried about the report

        , whish is going to be released by the state government. It is looking at training expenditure, and trying to cut further and move vocational courses into the competitive market. I believe that TAFE in New South Wales has provided industry and our communities with skilled and trained workers that are second to none. The apprenticeship system, which the federal government is supporting, has been dominated by TAFE because of the quality of training that is provided through those institutions. There are private providers that do provide training, but the quality and the knowledge that those students who are trained through TAFE have is second to none. I know that TAFE teachers are worried about a voucher system being introduced in New South Wales, and I know that those people in my electorate who are attending TAFE are also concerned about the implications for them.

        The final thing that I would like to put on the record is the change to the workers compensation system. As a person who worked in rehabilitation, I am terribly concerned that the changes the New South Wales state government has pushed through will be counterproductive. Rather than injured workers re-entering the workforce I think that there are going to be fewer workers who are going to be prepared to undertake retraining and take the risk of re-entering the workforce. From my initial reading of the legislation I think that there is extreme concern for workers who are injured. I believe that all members should come together and support workers.
