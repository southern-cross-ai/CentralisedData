        My question is to the Minister for Skills and Training. How is the Albanese Labor government making it easier for Australians to undertake education and training and keep more of what they earn?

         I thank the member for Makin for his question and his strong advocacy for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
          VET

         sector in his electorate and across the country. In response to the worst skills shortage in 50 years, this government responded quickly by initiating programs like fee-free
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         and, indeed, it struck the first national skills agreement with state and territory governments in a decade. This will deliver the reforms that are required to supply skills to a much-needed, rapidly changing modern economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last year we smashed our 180,000 fee-free TAFE target by ensuring that 300,000 Australians were enrolled in courses, ensuring that they are acquiring the skills in demand for our economy, for businesses and for workers. The National Skills Agreement will see the creation of centres of excellence, bringing together TAFEs and universities to ensure that they collaborate so they can supply the skills that are very much needed. As a result of the great success and uptake of fee-free TAFE, we're making available a further 300,000 places, starting this year. Like any good policy, it achieves more than one goal. Not only does it encourage students to enrol in courses in areas of demand but it provides real cost-of-living relief for students doing it tough. In some cases this will amount to more than $10,000 a year for courses.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the government's plans do not stop there for these students, because we are providing a tax cut for Australians. That means hundreds of thousands of these students—those who are working part-time—will receive a tax cut as a result of this government's tax plan, and for that reason we should be ensuring that this passes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's quite true that if those opposite were in government now none of these students would be receiving any of the relief under the tax plan of this government, because we know they would not be changing their position. We know that, in their heart of hearts, they do not support this proposal. In their heart of hearts, they are totally opposed to this proposal. They would like to see these students miss out on tax cuts that we're providing as a result of this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need to ensure, in as many ways as we can, that we provide relief for many people across this country. That's why all taxpayers will be getting relief. In particular, these students are aspiring to better themselves and to acquire skills in these areas so that they can have decent, well-paid jobs. They, like other Australians, have aspirations, and we're going to ensure that we encourage them through fee-free TAFE and a tax cut.
