        I rise to congratulate the West Welcome Wagon, which recently won a $2,000 first prize from the Bendigo Bank Seddon Community Bank branch community pitch. The community pitch allows local not-for-profits to pitch interesting projects to community members and potential sponsors, who all vote on their favourite idea. The West Welcome Wagon was founded in September 2013 by a local resident, Mia McGregor, who was moved to action after visiting a newly arrived asylum seeker home and finding that they were without electricity, bedding or cooking equipment. Mia launched the group on Facebook after sharing her experience and receiving enormous community support. I have followed their progress closely and have been moved to personally support their cause recently. The West Welcome Wagon currently provides goods such as bedding, food and clothing to over 500 families in Melbourne's west. Most of the people who are assisted by the West Welcome Wagon are on bridging visas. Many have not had working rights and are only eligible for a portion of the Newstart allowance. In the first year alone, West Welcome Wagon provided over 500 beds, 460 food hampers and 100 bicycles, all donated by local residents and groups. They also provide children's toys, kitchen appliances and in-home English language support. The $2,000 first prize will go towards draught-proofing properties. Electricity prices are expensive and draughts can account for up to 40 per cent of heat lost in homes. Draught-proofing is a cheap and effective way of keeping people warm as we head into winter. So congratulations to the West Welcome Wagon and to the entire community of the west, who have come together in this generous project.
