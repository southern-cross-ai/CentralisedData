          (1) expresses its grave concern that:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (a) the Albanese Government's catastrophic handling of the NZYQ High Court case has resulted in the mass release of hardened criminals from detention into the Australian community;

          (d) the Minister for Immigration has now released 142 highly dangerous individuals, when the High Court's full reasons make clear he was only required to release the applicant NZYQ;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (e) the Minister for Immigration's agreement in May that there was no real prospect of NZYQ being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future was made before all resettlement options had been exhausted and led directly to the loss of the case;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (f) the Minister for Immigration claimed these criminals were on visas with strict conditions and then later admitted that those conditions were completely unenforceable;

          (2) condemns the Albanese Government for:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (a) causing the greatest failure of Australia's immigration system since 50,000 people, including NZYQ, arrived on more than 800 boats under Labor;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (b) catastrophically failing to prepare for a High Court decision, despite having almost six months warning;

          (c) failing at every step following the court's decision to take the action necessary to keep Australians safe; and

          (d) putting Australian lives at risk by undertaking a chaotic and uncontrolled mass release of hardened criminals into the community.
