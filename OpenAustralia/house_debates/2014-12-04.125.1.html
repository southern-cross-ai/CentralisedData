       <p>
        I rise in this three-minute statement to associate myself with those comments being made by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the House. I think a way that we can demonstrate our bipartisanship and a sense of Christmas spirit, as we lead to Christmas, is to remember that we are all here in this place to do the right thing and the best thing by people who send us here. I think, at times, it is important we reflect on the things that really do unite us, rather than sometimes the things that might divide us. On behalf of my constituency, I want to associate myself and my constituency with the comments of both sides of the House and Madam Speaker.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a very difficult year in my electorate, particularly with many being drought declared since early 2013. As we lead up to Christmas this year, I want the people of my constituency—whether on the land, whether they are small businesses in the country towns, whether they are the volunteers out there or charities helping so many of those communities right now—to know that they are not alone. This parliament has had a responsibility to respond, as have state parliaments. I want to let them know that they are not alone. I am thinking of them, as I have throughout the year. I can assure them that I can only hope that before we get the Christmas we see the heavens open up and bring what is going to help enormously—much-needed rain.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say, also, that as we lead up to Christmas we should never lose sight of the true meaning of Christmas. We celebrate the birth of Christ, which gives so many of us the opportunity to reflect on the meaning of Christmas. It is for families and friends, but never let us forget that the Christmas story is one that, I think, helps the nation. It helps me. It certainly guides me with a moral and a spiritual compass. It helps us and it helps me make those decisions and form opinions based on the reason we have Christmas. It is important that we do not just see it as another holiday, but a time for reflection, and a celebration of the birth of Christ 2015 years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say thank you to all of those who are so often working—volunteers, emergency workers, our troops and nurses—and all of those who will be on standby. When we are enjoying Christmas lunch or dinner with our family and friends, they will be out there making sure that the electricity is still there. They will be out there making sure that our roads are safe. They will be there working in hospitals, looking after the sick and those not so well off. I do remember them and it is time that we say, 'Have a happy Christmas,' to all of them. When we come back refreshed in the new year, a new resolution is to make sure that we do it for the best and right interest on behalf of all Australians. I thank the chamber.

         Thank you for those kind words, Deputy Speaker. I call the member for Lingiari. I would like to put on the record my thanks to you for your bipartisan support earlier this week when we were talking about
