       <p>
        This week is National Carers Week. It is an important time to recognise the 2.8 million carers in this country who do unpaid caring work for so many. It is important to remember them this week and commit ourselves to providing support to those who care. These carers are right through our community, caring for people with disabilities, older family members and younger children with a disability. They are not able to meet their full potential because they are caring for those in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, though, I want to recognise a group that is often forgotten about, and that is young carers, carers who look after mum or dad, grandma or grandpa or an older brother or sister. These carers are in our schools and universities, and we need to give them special attention for the work they do. In my electorate, Carer Support in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphett_Vale" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , is providing that care for the carers. It gives a great opportunity for carers—young carers and older carers alike—to get together, to exchange ideas and, most importantly, to share a cup of tea and a bit of support. In National Carers Week it is important that we remember that carers count and that we recognise the very important role that unpaid carers play in our community.
