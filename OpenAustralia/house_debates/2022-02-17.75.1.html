        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister please inform the House how strong economic management helps to create jobs and opportunities for Australians, and is the Prime Minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Groom. He understands that a strong economy is the basis for everything else that you hope to achieve as a government. It's a strong economy that guarantees the essentials that Australians rely on, whether that's the pension, whether that is aged-care funding—at record levels under this government—whether it's the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It all depends on the economic and financial management that is necessary to ensure a strong economy. A strong economy means a stronger future.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm asked about the uncertainty of the times and what is necessary. What you need is strong economic leadership and strong leadership on national security. There needs to be strength in your decisions, and there is no room for weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've been asked about alternative approaches. It is true: I've answered the member for Lindsay about the government's strong economic plan, but there is an alternative approach that we know that comes from the Labor Party. It was the shadow Treasurer who was asked, by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Speers" rel="nofollow">
          David Speers
         </a>
         : 'Would you increase taxes for ordinary Australians at all?' His answer: he said, 'We haven't finalised our full suite of policies.' As you'd appreciate, Mr Speaker, there are still two budget updates between now and the next election. There was a simple answer: 'No. No, we're not going to increase taxes,' but the shadow Treasurer couldn't answer it that way. We know the Labor Party, and the Labor leader in particular, have always been for higher taxes, as the Treasurer has been reminding the House. He's been for a mining tax. He's been for a carbon tax. He's been for a congestion tax. He's been for a retirees' tax. He's been for inheritance taxes.

               There will be a choice made by Australians this year at the election, and they will be weighing up the choice, and economic management will be a key factor in that choice because of the uncertain times which we face. The leader of the Labor Party has supported higher taxes all his life. To think he wouldn't do so when push comes to shove at the behest of the member for Melbourne and the Greens is pure fantasy. Weak financial management: they would have spent $81 billion more during the pandemic from the very policies they enunciated during the time. Their climate policies will only put electricity prices up, because they don't strike the right balance. And small business will face a rejuvenated militant union movement, whether on the waterfront or in the supply chain, choking up their supply chains. This is the Leader of the Opposition who wanted the government to buy an airline in the middle of the pandemic, but when he was transport minister he couldn't even build an airport.

                Before I call the member for Hotham, I want to remind members what standing order 65(b) says. I'll read it out to you. It's very short. I won't detain the House very long. It says:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                When a Member is speaking, no Member may converse aloud or make any noise or disturbance to interrupt the Member.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's pretty straightforward really. I don't expect everyone to be silent, but the level of interjections is far too high. I'd ask members on all sides of the House to please keep it down. The member for Hotham has the call.
