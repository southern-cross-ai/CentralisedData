       <p class="italic">
        (c) the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of discrimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of poverty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, including at the level of the national parliament;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a 'plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the 'plans of action':
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legislative and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) require of government that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and Indigenous peoples;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) make regular use of plenary sessions in parliament and other parliamentary fora to discuss minority/Indigenous matters in order to raise awareness and combat prejudice in society, organise awareness-raising sessions for all parliamentarians so as to increase their knowledge of minorities and Indigenous peoples and the particular problems they face, and ensure that minority and Indigenous issues are mainstreamed into parliamentary work, especially at the committee level;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parliamentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) increase parliaments' familiarity with work being done within the United Nations system so as to equip them better to hold governments to account for their international commitments, including the achievement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        , urge ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, hold debates in parliament on the conclusions and recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special mechanisms with regard to minority and Indigenous peoples' rights;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and Indigenous peoples, and address their concerns in their party programs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) the IPU will facilitate networking among parliaments on this issue, monitor the implementation of the Chiapas Declaration and convene a follow-up meeting within two years to discuss progress and set targets for future action;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) urges the Government, parliamentarians, and political parties to familiarise themselves with the Chiapas Declaration; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls upon the Government to facilitate a roundtable discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. (Notice given 19 June 2012.)

       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges that a vibrant, independent news media is an essential component of a healthy democracy; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) considers that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the democratically essential concept of an independent news media not does equate to the unrestricted right of specific media owners, or the industry in general, to manage their businesses without a social licence to operate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recent developments in Australia, and in other democratic countries, including inappropriate relations between media owners and politicians, socially unacceptable methods of news gathering, socially unacceptable standards of factuality and veracity in news reporting, a failure to distinguish between factual news reporting and editorial opinion, falling circulations, declining sales revenues and failed business models, are all evidence,
        <i>

        of an industry that has lost its social licence to operate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) market competition can be a valuable mechanism for maintaining general, socially acceptable standards of journalism, but the concentration of news media ownership in the hands of a few represents,
        <i>
         prima facie,
        </i>
        a competitive market failure requiring compensatory regulation to ensure socially acceptable outcomes; and

        </a>

        (ii) commercially significant sanctions for failures to comply with relevant statutory regulations; and

       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that the:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) proposal of a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is a once-in-a-generation landmark reform that has the potential to deliver better quality of life outcomes for Australians with disabilities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) schedule for implementation of the NDIS, as proposed by the Productivity Commission, will take seven years, spanning the life of three Parliaments; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) NDIS is a reform that involves the cooperation and support of state and territory governments, the disability support services sector, people with a disability and their families and carers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes the bipartisan and cross-party support for the implementation of the NDIS;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) declares its support for policy stability on the NDIS over the life of those three Parliaments and until the scheme's full implementation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) resolves to immediately establish a Joint Select Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme which will:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) oversee the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) be subject to terms of reference to be agreed upon by the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader and ratified by this House;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) be comprised of 4 Government members and/or Senators, 4 Opposition members and/or Senators, 1 Greens member and/or Senator and 1 non-aligned member and/or Senator;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) be jointly chaired by 1 Government member and 1 Opposition member; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) remain in existence until the full implementation of the NDIS is achieved; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) transmit a message to establish a Joint Select Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme to the Senate for concurrence. (Notice given 22 May 2012.)

        (a) lower levels, chronic fatigue and joint pain leading to arthritis; and
