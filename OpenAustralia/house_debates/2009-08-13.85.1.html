        I wish to speak today in honour of

         Victory in the Pacific Day

        , which will be celebrated on Saturday, 15 August. The day commemorates Japan’s acceptance of the allied demand for unconditional surrender in 1945. For Australians, Victory in the Pacific Day, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP" rel="nofollow">
         VP
        </a>
        Day, meant that World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        was finally over. From historical accounts, it really was a celebration after six long years of war. Australia woke to find a world at peace. There was singing and dancing in the streets across the country. In Sydney, shredded paper rained down from office windows on the crowds and motor traffic came to a halt, with trams carrying revellers clinging to the sides and perched on the roofs. On Thursday, 16 August 1945, there was a more formal VP thanksgiving ceremony at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        in Canberra. A large crowd gathered to watch the march of ex-servicemen and to respect the fallen with the traditional minute’s silence. A fly-past of Australian fighters and Dutch bombers, based at Fairbairn, completed the ceremony. Today I ask all Australians to pause on Saturday for a few moments to remember those Australians who gave their lives to help achieve the peace that VP Day stands for. Their past sacrifice must never be forgotten.

        On VP Day it is also important to honour those veterans who returned to enjoy the peace that they had helped deliver to all Australians. According to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs annual report, there are 121,000 surviving

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        or the internet; he was actually there. Bill finally got back to Australia in early 1946, after spending time in the Pacific picking up Japanese troops from the surrounding islands. I thank Bill and the many other Australians for their service to our country. They must not be forgotten as we approach Victory in the Pacific Day.
