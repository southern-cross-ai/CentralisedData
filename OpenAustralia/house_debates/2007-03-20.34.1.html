        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does he believe that our troops in Afghanistan have sufficient resources to deal with the dangerous challenges they face as a result of the reported upcoming Taliban spring offensive?

         I thank the member for Hunter for that question. The answer is that we are examining at present the adequacy of the conditions in which our forces are currently operating. The defence minister has indicated that a group of defence people went to Afghanistan recently. I have said, and he has said, that we are looking at whether we might send some additional forces to provide additional support for the reconstruction group that is in Afghanistan. I had a discussion about this matter with the new

         commander, an American, General McNeill. I indicated that, if Australia were to send additional forces to Afghanistan, the principal task of those additional forces would be to provide additional protection to the existing Australian force.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best way I can summarise it is to say that the defence department and the ADF, in light of the report and the analysis that has been brought back, are currently examining whether we should send some more forces. If those forces do go to Afghanistan, they will have as their principal task providing additional protection to the Australian forces that are already there. That is the most up-to-date and full information that I can provide to the honourable member. I would be very happy to continue to assist him in providing such information.
