        With the number of mortgages in Hasluck 20 per cent higher than the national average, it is clear that many people are choosing to establish themselves in Perth's fastest-growing north-eastern corridor, and well may they do so, with our stunning vistas, great cafes, breweries, wineries, fresh produce from across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Valley
        </a>
        and the Perth hills, and good quality highways and freeways into the city. And, as of this weekend, the first lengths of track have been laid for the Morley to Ellenbrook METRONET line. A shout-out to Premier McGowan and the formidable Labor team in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        So the Albanese Labor government is committed to our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, to help people who want to buy, and take advantage of these supporting infrastructure projects, in Hasluck. And thank heavens that we are. After a decade-long absence of investment in social and affordable housing, we now have a Labor government that is committed to a suite of policies that will reignite the great Australian dream of owning your own home.
       </p>
       <p>
        And the policy has broad support. Industry Super Australia, for example, recognises that the fund would guarantee recurrent funding and could be easily scaled over time, with additional top-ups. There is support from community housing, the Housing Industry Association, the Urban Development Institute, the Property Council and National Shelter. I simply cannot understand why anyone would not support this policy. This is important reform that will make a practical difference in people's lives—people like those currently renting and looking to buy and those who are looking to move to one of the most well supported and vibrant communities in Hasluck.

         You can tell a lot about a government by where it spends its money. Spending is a reflection of priorities—what is deemed important and what will be kicked down the road. Two hundred and fifty-four billion dollars on the stage 3 tax cuts for Australia's richest is this government's priority. Three-hundred and sixty-eight billion dollars on nuclear submarines is a Labor priority. And capping social and affordable housing funding to $500 million a year is Labor kicking the housing crisis down the road.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are constantly told by this Labor government that we need to exhibit restraint—an argument that conveniently doesn't apply to submarines or to the $9,000 tax cuts they're giving to the wealthy but only applies when the working and middle classes ask for the bare minimum. The fact is that we can afford an annual $5 billion investment directly into social and affordable housing over 10 years. We can afford to double Commonwealth rent assistance as rents continue to skyrocket. And we can afford to make sure that all new social housing is built to minimum accessibility standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is absolutely no financial barrier to us bringing millions of Australians out of housing stress and out of homelessness.
