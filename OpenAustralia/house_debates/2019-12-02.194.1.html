        When I got home on Friday I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in the Penrith community Christmas tree lighting in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        with my family and thousands of locals. There was so much joy on this occasion, with everyone coming together to experience our wonderful community. Families, business owners and our local community took part in market stalls. I would like to thank the Penrith CBD Corporation, particularly Gai Hawthorn, and all the sponsors of this wonderful event.
       </p>
       <p>
        With my team and my children I hosted a stall where we handed out education packs for kids and had activities. I had the privilege of lighting the 30-foot Penrith Christmas tree, alongside community representatives and, of course,

        . There was so much enthusiasm from the thousands of children. I'd like to congratulate Paws Studio on the wonderful performances they put on for the people in our community that evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were over 12,000 people at this occasion last year and there were many more thousands this year, and I am sure it's only going to continue to grow. That's because it's events like this that show us who we really are, and many small businesses and not-for-profit organisations benefited from the fundraising at this event. I often say that in Lindsay we are full to the brim and overflowing with community spirit, and this was very much an event like that. I want to thank everyone who took part in this event and would like to wish everyone in my electorate a merry Christmas, a beautiful time with your families and God's blessings for the new year.
