       <p>
        I propose amendments to the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 to address issues raised by the Senate Legal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Constitutional Affairs Committee
        </a>
        in its report on these bills. The amendments will do three things. Firstly, the amendments will exclude serving judges of a state or territory court from being members of the commission. This will address the potential conflict-of-interest issues raised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The bill will continue to require that at least one member of the commission be a former Commonwealth judicial officer or a former state or territory
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Supreme Court
        </a>
        judge. Secondly, the amendments will clarify the status of the commission's separate report on sensitive matters for archiving purposes in order to ensure long-term custody and storage consistent with other records of the commission. Thirdly, the amendments will also clarify the application of aspects of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. This will ensure proceedings of the commission can be used in relation to prosecution of offences relating to a commission's investigation. These amendments ensure there is greater clarity about processes relating to a commission and will assist in addressing operational issues, should they arise.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note that I have approved minor additions to the explanatory memorandum of the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 and the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012. These additions will provide additional information in the Statements of Compatibility with
