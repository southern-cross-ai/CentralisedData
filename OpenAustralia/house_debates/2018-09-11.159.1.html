        It was very disappointing when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
        </a>
        chose not to take action against Coles and Woolworths in relation to their abuse of market power over the dollar milk price war. However, I do welcome the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        's recommendations in their report supporting a mandatory code of conduct to bring some fairness back to the dairy industry supply chain. The dollar milk price war started on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        in January 2011 and has gone on for too long and claimed too many innocent victims. Coles, in particular, and Woolworths should be ashamed of their un-Australian behaviour, which has only wreaked havoc and grief on the dairy industry and devastated dairy farms. These practices by supermarket giants can no longer be tolerated.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        , David Littleproud, recently visited Gympie to meet with dairy industry representatives. We discussed a range of issues about how to improve the farmgate price and how a mandatory code of conduct would need to cover everyone in the supply chain, from the farmer right through to the boardroom of the major retailers. We all agreed that the dairy industry is in crisis and will be wiped out unless things change dramatically. The minister asked the industry to unite and bring forward a proposal on how farmers could achieve a fair price for their product. He also warned that time is running out and he would take action if the industry failed to reach agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ACCC's report considered that a mandatory code would benefit dairy farmers, as it would address the bargaining power imbalance between the farmers and the processors. The ACCC inquiry found dairy farmers are disadvantaged, as processors have better access to price and market information and the supermarkets were using their bargaining power over processors to slash the price of milk. A mandatory code of conduct must include the supermarkets. It's the supermarkets that set the retail price for milk and determine the value of the supply chain from the retailer to the processor and, subsequently, the farmer. I implore Coles and Woolworths to do the right thing, but, after seven years of dollar milk, I'm not holding my breath. If the retailers won't play fair, I welcome the minister's move to make them. Farmers deserve a fair go.

        There's nothing more important than the wellbeing of our young people. It is very much the responsibility of all of us to ensure the very best of services are readily available to support, nurture and advance those who are our future. Whilst today's society is becoming more convenient, with much more efficient and effective forms of transport and communication, this new fast-paced lifestyle does not necessarily translate into young people being less stressed, or, in many cases, young people facing less disadvantage: the stresses and disadvantage are just different. To address the problems associated with mental health, related physical health, alcohol and drug abuse and social and vocational support, we need the best possible services, preferably provided with some input from the young people that these services are designed to help.

        That's where headspace comes in. headspace offers exactly that, and this is why I was so proud to be part of the official opening of the Gympie headspace on 28 August. The Australian government, through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Wide Bay
        </a>
        , Sunshine Coast Primary Health Network is investing more than $719,000 over 2018-19 to bring headspace services to Gympie. Mental health disorders constitute one of the most common chronic illnesses affecting young people in Australia, with one in four young people expected to experience mental ill health. Services like headspace can be a critical first step in getting the right support at the right time and reducing the impact and duration of mental ill health for a young person. My home town of Gympie experiences relatively high levels of youth mental illness and self-harm linked to social disadvantage, so it will particularly benefit from this new service.
       </p>
       <p>
        With more than 5,000 young people aged between 12 and 24 living within the Gympie local government area, our new headspace service will provide a very important addition to the mental health support available in the area. The development and ongoing running of this headspace will be taken care of by United Synergies, which is a fantastic local support service I regularly work closely with. I particularly acknowledge three very keen young people, Sam, Julian and Shane, who not only served on the organising committee for the Gympie headspace by contributing their extensive local knowledge but also gave me a very informative tour of the venue on the day of the opening.

        I would like to pay tribute to everyone involved in the production of
        <i>
         Brainstorm
        </i>
        , a short film which has been produced by students at Gympie Flexible Learning Centre for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Week. Mental Health Week runs from 6 to 14 October and reminds us all of the importance of promoting positive mental health and wellbeing, creating understanding of mental illness and recovery and celebrating the lives of young people living with mental ill health.
        <i>
         Brainstorm
        </i>
        is the result of a joint project between the Gympie Collaborative Network Mental Health Sub-Group and the Gympie Flexible Learning Centre. Directed by Ande Foster and Sally Haxton and produced by my friend Gaylene Johnston, 33 students from the Flexible Learning Centre participated in its making and 27 students appear in acting roles. The short film was made on a shoestring budget with sponsorship of under $3,000 from the regional primary health network,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gympie_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">

        and On Track Community Programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The film tells of the struggles and challenges that teenagers experience and provides hope, reassurance and inspiration as to how life's obstacles can be overcome. Some of
        <i>
         Brainstorm's
        </i>
        key messages are: never give up; you can always ask for help; are you okay?; it's okay not to be okay; and believe in yourself.
        <i>
         Brainstorm
        </i>
        provides us with an insight as to what life feels like as a young person in today's world and improves understanding around mental health. The thought-provoking film, which runs for nearly 11 minutes, looks at the use of social media and addresses the impact it has on young people in our community. The film will become a valuable mental health resource, and I hope that it becomes a useful tool for local young people and young people across the country. The film contains powerful themes that can benefit parents, teachers and the broader community as it provides an insight into how young people perceive their world and strategies on how they can best be supported on their mental health journey.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having been filmed in one of the best locations in Australia, the film showcases our region's stunning scenery and landmarks that we are all so proud of. The film has been selected as a finalist in the young filmmakers category at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Gold_International_Short_Film_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Heart of Gold International Short Film Festival
        </a>
        , which starts on 4 October, the week before Mental Health Week.
        <i>
         Brainstorm
        </i>
        will be screened on Sunday, 7 October. I commend everyone involved in this wonderful project. You've done an amazing job.
