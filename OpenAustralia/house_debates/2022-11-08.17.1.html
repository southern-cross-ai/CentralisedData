        () (): I am extremely disappointed that three initiatives funded by the previous coalition government and promised for the Riverina electorate are not going to be honoured by this incoming Labor government. I refer specifically to more than $20 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">

        Airport, and I know the member for New England in his previous role as Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development helped me fund that prior to the election. That commitment was going to enable a new airport terminal—a much-needed airport terminal—for Wagga Wagga. If you've flown into the city, you know it is the gateway to the Riverina. But you also know that it desperately needs a new terminal. It was also going to provide some funding for a potential business park and other things relating to the tarmac, which were desperately needed. Of course,

        is owned by Defence. It is the home of the

        , and long may that continue because Defence contributes billions of dollars to the regional economy.

        There was also a $20 million initiative that was announced by Senator McKenzie for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt_University" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Sturt University
        </a>
        . I fought hard for this initiative at the home of agricultural excellence, the home of much farming research done not just throughout southern

        . It certainly has one of those fantastic drought hubs that the Nationals leader, the member for Maranoa, established. Indeed, it has been a centre of excellence since it was first known as the experimental farm way back in 1892. It has a long history, and that $20 million was going to provide for an expansion of the AgriPark, an expansion of all of the work that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Graham" rel="nofollow">

        centre does. Eddie Graham was a former Labor state minister, who was known as the 'Minister for Wagga Wagga', such was his contribution to our city and agriculture in general. I acknowledge the work done by the late Eddie Graham and the work done by Charles Sturt University. I am very disappointed that that work isn't going to be completed because this government has shunned the funding.

       <p>
        Then we come to the veterans' centre. Indeed, I worked with the minister opposite, and I thank him for his cooperation in this regard. I'll give Labor another chance in the May budget next year. I know the new minister understands the importance of wellness centres and wellbeing among our veterans. We just heard from the member for Herbert, a fine veteran. He talked about his Afghanistan experience in the speech he just gave. We need to make sure our veterans are looked after, and this $5 million—
