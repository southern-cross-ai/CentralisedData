        [by video link] We are seeing a crisis unfolding in Afghanistan, a crisis that is a result of this government doing too little, too late. We've known for a long time the issue that Afghan interpreters have faced, and the threats that they've faced and that their families have faced are real—and this government has sat on its hands and done absolutely nothing. Earlier this year, as far back as January, the government was made aware of the issues facing the Afghan interpreters, and it did nothing. When it closed the embassy in May, all it did was hasten the need to get the Afghan interpreters to safety. Let's remember, these men, predominantly men, put their lives on the line for the

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . They wore our uniforms and they were paid by our government. Yet we see them being left and cast aside as if they amounted to nothing, because the government had a political problem. What we've seen once again is the typical characterisation of this government: let's wait and do something, too little, too late. These people should have been out.

        One of my greatest regrets is that the former Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        is now the Minister for Defence. He never had the decency to meet with Australian Defence Force war veterans who were trying to save the lives of the interpreters who helped save theirs. It is a systemic problem with this government that it is all talk and no action. It is all about spin and marketing. Meanwhile, lives are being put at risk, lives that were used to help save Australian soldiers—

         resurgence has been rapid and absolute, sweeping resistance before it and leaving fear and uncertainty in its path. Every night our televisions are full of images of crying children, despairing parents and heaving throngs of people, all aiming to be the lucky ones to get on a plane out of Afghanistan. Our government is doing great work in an incredibly tough situation, getting people on planes, but, despite this, getting on a plane is very difficult. Soon the planes will stop flying and the world's next refugee crisis will be upon us. It will be the responsibility of those countries that have been involved in the rebuilding of Afghanistan to step up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the past 20 years, we have worked with Afghans to help them dream of a renewed country, with opportunities for all. In light of our not having achieved this goal, we cannot leave those we have worked alongside to suffer while we wash our hands. Australia must be generous and lead at the forefront of this humanitarian response. Australia is a generous country. When the world is in crisis, we open our doors, as
