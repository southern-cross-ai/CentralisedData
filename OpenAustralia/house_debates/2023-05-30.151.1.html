        I rise today as the federal member for Durack to once again address a matter of grave concern that is gripping our regional communities in

        . That is the unprecedented and extremely concerning levels of youth crime. While it is undeniable that youth crime is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects various parts of our nation, it is particularly acute in regional and remote areas. It is wreaking havoc on our towns and regions, pushing our hospitals, police forces, community organisations, local councils and families to their breaking point.
       </p>
       <p>
        In regional Australia, our towns and communities are characterised by close knit relationships and a strong sense of community. However, this crisis is threatening to erode the fabric of these communities, undermining the safety, wellbeing and cohesion that are vital for their growth and prosperity.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimberley" rel="nofollow">
         The Kimberley
        </a>
        , the Pilbara and the towns of Carnarvon and Geraldton, all within the electorate of Durack, are bearing the brunt of this worrying trend. The time for urgent change is upon us.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many factors contributing to the scourge of youth crime. I believe one of the key factors in regional areas is the lack of adequate social and recreational opportunities for young people. Limited access to educational resources, training programs and employment opportunities often leaves our youth feeling disillusioned and disconnected. The sense of exclusion can drive some individuals towards criminal activities as a means of finding belonging or asserting their presence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Young children aged six, seven and eight are not naturally inclined to commit crimes or to be on the street late at night. Unfortunately, though, often, due to alcohol abuse and parental neglect, their home is not a safe place. Therefore, these kids find their family out on the streets, where it is often safer for them to be than at home. Older kids encourage younger ones to act up, to get involved, so they are included in the group.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, the challenges of geographical isolation and limited infrastructure in rural areas can exacerbate the issue. Young people may feel isolated and disengaged, with limited avenues for positive engagement and personal development. These factors, combined with issues such as substance abuse, mental health and family breakdown, create an environment where youth crime can thrive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our community leaders and local government representatives are deeply troubled by the impact that youth crime is having on their communities. While it is true that the state government holds the primary responsibility for addressing crime, the federal government plays a significant role in investing in youth diversionary programs. Prior to the last election, I was working closely with Minister Ken Wyatt on initiating a review of these investments. I wrote to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on 3 February this year to ask him to commence an urgent review of the Commonwealth's investment in youth diversionary programs. If this work has not been commenced, I implore the federal government to take immediate action, as this is something that is within our control.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impacts of youth crime on regional communities are significant and far-reaching. In Durack, isolation is a way of life for many residents. However, due to the unprecedented levels of crime, there is now a heightened level of fear and anxiety amongst residents in conjunction with a visible erosion of community trust and social cohesion and the strain placed on local services such as law enforcement, health care and support organisations. Recent data has revealed a disturbing rise in crime across the

        -Gascoyne district, particularly in assaults. Compared to the same period last year, there has been a concerning 44 per cent increase in assaults, accompanied by a 32 per cent rise in police assaults. These statistics are deeply troubling, signalling a dangerous trend that demands our immediate attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The town of Carnarvon in my electorate, which more recently has been suffering immensely from the impacts of youth crime, recently had significant alcohol restrictions imposed to help combat the violence. Shire president

        recently quit Carnarvon's liquor accord, stating he had been unfairly vilified by some in the town for supporting the restrictions, and criticised people within the accord. I'd like to take the opportunity to commend President Smith and the Shire of Carnarvon, who I believe have done everything within their power to rectify this very troubling social issue. However, there is only so much that he and the shire can do.

        Among the incidents that have shocked our regional communities of late is rock throwing, which has emerged as a particularly distressing problem. In Geraldton alone, local police have had 20 reports of rocks being thrown at vehicles since April this year, endangering the lives of innocent motorists. These numerous reports include brick throwing at a woman inside her car, security guards and customers being hit by rocks in a shopping centre and a young boy killing a bird on the street. These are just a few of the alarming incidents that have occurred. We must recognise the gravity of these acts and their potential to escalate into even more serious crimes. The most recent reported rock-throwing incident was on 14 April when, police said, three youths aged 13 threw rocks at a 12-year-old boy and his friends who were riding motorbikes in Geraldton bushland. A fight allegedly occurred between the groups and a 13-year-old received an three-centimetre cut to his right abdomen plus other minor injuries. Mid West police superintendent

        became a victim of rock throwing when his work car was pelted by a projectile in September last year, narrowly avoiding tragedy. Also in September last year, a local road-train driver was shaken when a rock came through his vehicle's windshield, narrowly missing his head, while he was travelling on the Geraldton-Mount Magnet Road. These incidents illustrate the seriousness of the situation. Innocent lives are being put at risk, and the time for action is now. I would say that the time for action has passed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to highly commend the Mid West Aboriginal corporation Bundiyarra, which has taken the initiative to address the issue of rock throwing by engaging with the broader community in Geraldton and the Mid West and, ultimately, with the parents of the youths involved. A public meeting was held recently where community members voiced their concerns and brainstormed potential solutions. Ideas such as reintroducing the Yamatji community patrol and establishing an after-hours safe house managed by Aboriginal elders were put forward. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the meeting, because parliament was sitting. However, I had electorate staff representing me at the meeting. This collaborative approach should be encouraged and supported, and I believe it serves as a very positive model that could be followed by other Aboriginal organisations who have been impacted.

        Recent key Kununurra stakeholders wrote to the Western Australia state minister and Department of Communities. Their letter outlines the group's views on the necessary measures to curb the antisocial behaviour of youth in the East Kimberley region, and states, 'There is an urgent need for assistance and intervention around community safety within our town.' Their recommendations include constructing safe places for vulnerable children and youth to sleep and enjoy a healthy meal—sounds pretty simple and straightforward, doesn't it?—the recruitment of local staff to assist youth through night patrol and curfew assistance, and greater funding for police housing and a new police station, as well as lowering the age limit for engagement with critical services. I'd like to commend once again the authors of that letter: the Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley,

        Investment in education and skill-building programs is essential to empowering young people in regional areas, enabling them to develop positive aspirations and a sense of purpose. Enhancing access to mental health services, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and family support initiatives is equally important in addressing the underlying issues that contribute to youth crime. Furthermore, it is imperative to work closely with community leaders, organisations and residents to develop community led initiatives that engage young people, promote positive role models and foster a sense of belonging and civic responsibility. By investing in community infrastructure, recreational facilities and youth-specific services, we can provide the necessary tools and opportunities for young people to flourish.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is urgent. We have to invest in fit-for-purpose youth diversionary programs that are specifically tailored to the needs of our regional communities, and we must do this in conjunction with the local Aboriginal organisations. Collaboration between federal, state and local governments is crucial in developing these comprehensive strategies and implementing targeted interventions that address the root cause of youth crime and provide effective support mechanisms. Sadly, many young people in my electorate end up in Banksia Hill Detention Centre. These young people ultimately are not born this way. They have no role models to help them, to lead the way or to tell them right from wrong. WA Premier Mark McGowan recently said the behaviour of the youths was 'a form of terrorism'. Premier, these comments are unhelpful and show a complete misunderstanding about how these kids have come to be in the situation they find themselves in. They are not terrorists; they are simply troubled children. We've got to do so much better.
