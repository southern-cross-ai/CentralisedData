         I thank the member for Flynn for his question and acknowledge that when meteorologists begin measuring rainfall by feet rather than by the old country way, in inches, there is certainly a problem. On the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Coast
         </a>
         and other parts of Queensland, on the North Coast and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Mid North Coast
         </a>
         of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , and in the upper reaches of Sydney, there are issues with these once-in 50-year rainfall events. Communities all the way up to Brisbane and the Gold Coast are considered to be very much at risk at the moment. I appreciate that some members on both sides of the House are not here; their communities are inundated. We feel for them as they endeavour to lead and help their communities through this. I understand that they are in close contact with first responders. Our first responders are truly magnificent. They are always there in times of crisis.

         The member for Cowper and the member for Lyne are with their communities today. I and Minister Littleproud have been getting regular updates from both of them—as has the Prime Minister and, no doubt, members on the other side as well—in regard to the seriousness of these floods. The member for Cowper has been with his community every step of the way. He has attended the evacuation centre in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
          Port Macquarie
         </a>
         , which is housing about 300 evacuees, and also the evacuation centre in Kempsey, which has 100 people who are very much needing that support right now. He helped improve the communications coordination for the hundreds of residents cut off on the north shore of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_River" rel="nofollow">
          Hastings River
         </a>
         in Port Macquarie. The ferry is unable to operate due to floodwaters.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that the transport industry has been magnificent through COVID-19 and again has stepped up to this latest challenge. The Port Macquarie based transport company Jim Pearson Transport is currently ensuring freight gets to where it needs to be. Queensland freight is being rerouted via Grafton and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          New England Highway
         </a>
         as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Highway
         </a>
         is blocked. B-doubles are being decoupled to enable them to take smaller alternative routes to get freight through; and that is so important.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Lyne has been getting regular updates. Having been isolated with his wife Charlotte on Saturday, he has been able to get out today to talk to the people and listen to them at Marine Rescue Camden Haven. The community evacuation centre at Laurieton United Services Club took in 300 on Saturday, 300 yesterday and 240 today. These are challenging times. In these moments of crisis, we see the very best of Australians—whether it be ordinary everyday Australians who do wonderful and amazing things on behalf of others, or whether it be our first responders, we thank them. We are certainly not through it yet, but I know they'll step up to the challenge again over coming days and weeks.
