        I rise to speak today about one of the important areas in my electorate that regularly features in the local news, and one that I know many Australians can relate to, whether they work in it, work to represent it or simply use its services. I want to speak about St George public hospital in Kogarah.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's healthcare system is world-class, and I know that no-one in this chamber would dispute that. What sets us apart is only how our public health system is funded, managed and maintained. It is truly a privilege for every Australian citizen to benefit from outstanding medical care. But, unfortunately, most of us will undertake a trip to the hospital at some point in our lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having been a St George resident for all of my life, and having a young family of my own, and representing the growing population of Barton, St George public hospital is of critical importance to me. The hospital is one of the most iconic and valued service providers within my electorate and has an immensely proud history, starting from 1894 when it became the cottage hospital. Over the years it has quickly developed into other medical departments, drawing specialists and patients from all around Australia. St George public hospital's emergency department is now one of the busiest in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , taking in more than 68,000 people each year, about 25,000 of whom are admitted. Unfortunately for St George hospital, the number of emergency patients awaiting treatment has not been reflected in the way the hospital has been funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        For as long as I had been a mayor and councillor of Kogarah City Council, and even more since being elected to the 44th Parliament last year, constituents, friends and even strangers have lamented the poor state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         St George Hospital
        </a>
        . Up until recently, it was difficult to believe that St George Hospital could be considered world-class. The staff had always been exceptional in their treatment and care of its patients, but the conditions in which they worked in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" rel="nofollow">
         First World
        </a>
        economy and world-class healthcare system were questionable at best and appalling at worst.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I was initially invited to visit the hospital by a senior member of New South Wales Health, I was utterly shocked at the deteriorating conditions the hospital was facing. It would be nothing short of a lie to say the hospital was neglected and in a condition unfit for the complex and life-saving procedures its specialists undertook on a frequent basis. Years of continuous neglect by the previous New South Wales Labor government had taken its toll on the facilities and infrastructure of the hospital. The hospital had been rated poor and in a state of code red. What I saw on our detailed tour of the facilities were cramped, outdated facilities with some departments operating solely out of demountables and patients suffering from toilet shortages. In fact, the maternity waiting room was a threadbare space with six awkward plastic chairs in nothing more than a hole-in-the-wall space.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addressing the flood of concerns from my constituents, I can only describe the truth, in that I witnessed firsthand that St George Hospital was in a state of absolute shambles. It was absolutely appalling and heartbreaking to see my constituents having to face this as their only option in the St George area. The need for a rebuild of St George Hospital has been known for some time by the state government, and the truth is that absolutely nothing happened until the New South Wales state Liberal government came along. The shamefully inactive New South Wales state Labor government has been nothing less than dreadful, and it has been inexcusable.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is simply no plausible reasoning the New South Wales state opposition can use to justify the 16-year-long neglect that St George public hospital has had to endure. The hospital was left to languish term after term after Labor re-election until the New South Wales Minister for Health came along, the Hon. Jillian Skinner MP. History demonstrates that nothing more would need to be done. There was no lack of funding that would justify the state the hospital was kept in. How can the New South Wales state opposition claimed to promise a rebuild of the hospital and have the people of Barton trust them when time and time again they have failed to do so?
       </p>
       <p>
        Remarkably, in four years, the New South Wales Liberal government has committed $41 million for the St George public hospital, starting with the emergency department. I witnessed the opening of the long-awaited emergency department, and whilst it was exciting it was also bittersweet. It served to remind me that my constituents waited more than 16 years after continuously dashed hopes under New South Wales state Labor for the hospital to begin building the necessary infrastructure it deserves. Despite those opposite who criticise the Liberal Party, I stand before this House today to confirm and remind everyone that it is the current New South Wales government which committed $41 million to the St George public hospital within its first term. It was an election commitment and it has been kept. I commend the New South Wales government for addressing and prioritising the needs of the St George residents.
