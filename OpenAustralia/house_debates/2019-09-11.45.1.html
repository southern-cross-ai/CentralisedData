        Some may say there's a fair bit of bull in this place, but not as much as in the recent Youth Bull Riders World Finals, which were held in the United States in late August. I'd like to congratulate 11-year-old Levi Ward, who not only qualified for the world finals but took out second place in the under 11 division. This young fellow from Kundabung just outside Kempsey is no stranger to success. Last year he placed 11th in the world finals. He has continued his excellent form in 2019 and is the current leader of the Australian Bushmen's Campdraft and Rodeo Association eight to under 11 steer-riding and barrel race as well as the under-18 all-round junior cowboy.

        In celebrating his success, we can't forget his proud parents Tash and

        , and the huge commitment they've made to get Levi to and from his rodeos and meets and to encourage him to world title success. But domestic and international travel isn't cheap, though, so I encourage any business, community group or organisation to help Levi chase his dreams. And chase his dreams he does. Looking up to his hero Pete Farley, another world champion bull rider from Kempsey, Levi is intent on returning to Texas next year and he's hoping for third-time lucky and to take out the world title. Once again, I congratulate him for his success so far. I'm sure there will be much more to come, and that's no bull!
