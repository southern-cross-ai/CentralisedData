        On 21 August, I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Raphael's" rel="nofollow">
         St Raphael's
        </a>
        Catholic Primary School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Hurstville" rel="nofollow">
         South Hurstville
        </a>
        to talk to kids in year 5 and 6 about government. They had visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        on 11 August. It was really good to have an informal chat with the kids and teachers about what they learned here during their visit and also to be asked some very interesting questions by the kids. St Raphael's in South Hurstville has about 220 students. Its history dates back to 1929, when the classes were held in the church and in local homes. The school itself was established on its formal grounds back in 1952. I would like to thank the principal, Annette McKenzie, for all the work she does in the community and also all the kids I visited on the day. I look forward to future visits.

        On 21 August, I attended the annual business luncheon hosted by the Australian Lebanese Chamber of Commerce at Doltone House in Sydney. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALCC" rel="nofollow">
         ALCC
        </a>
        has a long history of advocating for the concerns of the Australian Lebanese business community and also for fostering trade links between Australia and Lebanon. In my electorate more than 7,000 people trace their ancestry to Lebanon. It was good to meet with the leaders of the Australian Lebanese business community on the day. It was also good to see His Excellency Bishop Antoine-Charbel Tarabay at the event. I would also like to thank the president of the chamber, Joe Khattar AM, as well as the ALCC director, Adam Malouf, for his kind invitation. I look forward to continuing to work with ALCC in the future.

        On 29 August I visited Peakhurst South Public School, a fantastic, vibrant school in the heart of my electorate which is very ably led by its principal, Natasha Eaton. I spoke to the kids in years 5 and 6 about our federal government and how it works, and also took a number of great questions from the kids. Peakhurst South celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. It has children not only from the Peakhurst South region but also from surrounding suburbs, including Lugarno and Mortdale. I would like to thank the students at Peakhurst South for their questions, and I also thank the teachers from stage 3,

        and Josh Hurkett. I look forward to visiting the school very soon in the future.
