       <p>
        Yesterday I was pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the Main Committee to praise the life and work of Steve Irwin, a person I have had an enormously high regard for and who I have known for many years. I was absolutely appalled at comments made by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_Greer" rel="nofollow">
         Germaine Greer
        </a>
        in relation to the sad passing of Steve Irwin. Steve is someone who did suffer from Australia’s ‘Let’s cut down the tall poppy’ syndrome; there were so many people prepared to undermine and criticise him for the wonderful work that he did. I have to say that Germaine Greer seems to be almost out in a class of her own because most people would accept that at the time of such a sad event that Steve’s family were entitled to grieve in peace. Right around the world there has been a great outpouring of emotion and sympathy for Terri, Bob, Bindi and Steve’s parents at this sad time. Germaine Greer wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The animal world has finally taken its revenge on Irwin, but probably not before a whole generation of kids in shorts seven sizes too small has learned to shout in the ears of animals with hearing 10 times more acute than theirs, determined to become millionaire animal-loving zoo-owners in their turn.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not agree with everything that the member for Griffith says but I saw his interview and the way he was reported as very strongly criticising Germaine Greer for her inappropriate comments and I just want to endorse absolutely everything that he has said on this matter. What Steve Irwin has done is to encourage people to respect Australian fauna for what it is. He has pointed out that crocodiles are not dangerous to humans in their own environment as long as humans do not intrude.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has brought this love of Australian wildlife into reality. Thousands of kids have been to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Zoo" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Zoo
        </a>
        and millions have watched his television programs. All the way through, Steve has not been manipulating or exploiting our native animals but building a genuine love on the part of young people in the community for what is a very important resource—Australian fauna. I place on record my absolute disgust at the comments of Germaine Greer. They were completely inappropriate and I trust that my colleagues echo my sentiment in relation to this matter.
