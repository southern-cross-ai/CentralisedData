        Tonight I want to talk about my boots—the boots I am currently wearing. They are a fine pair of boots. They are made right in the middle of my electorate of Hindmarsh. They employ local people, they create Australian jobs and they help the local economy. It is my

        I am talking about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rossi Boots is a longstanding family-owned company in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . Founded by the Rossiter family in 1910, Rossi Boots is a significant contributor to our local economy. It is proudly 100 per cent Australian owned and employs about 100 Australian people. That is the reason I support them. They have had many opportunities to go offshore, like other textiles have, but they are persistent and devoted to their community, to South Australia, to creating jobs and to keeping our fine boots made locally in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many people around Australia who wear them proudly: farmers, construction workers and politicians in this place. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have seen a display I have in my window of Rossi Boots. I like to display local, Australian-made products that employ Australian workers and help our economy. I have a great display of a pair of boots in the window. I do this often with different businesses in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        It appears that Rossi Boots have gained a really good reputation for producing footwear that meets specific high-demand industries, notably supplying the Australian military. Unfortunately, in 2014 Rossi Boots lost their bid to provide boots to Defence and other uniformed personnel, costing the company a substantial amount of time and money in the bid they put forward. The explanation provided was, 'value for money'. A company that produces boots in Indonesia won this contract and was provided the tender, which is very sad, I think, when there is a great, iconic company that employs people here that missed out.
       </p>
       <p>
        This decision was extremely disheartening. It is another example where local companies—especially in South Australia—have been overlooked by governments both state and federal. We must be doing something to ensure our procurement policies and support for our local companies by governments is much better. I have raised this issue. I have written to the Prime Minister directly. I have not had a response yet, but I am sure I will get one soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also raised it with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government. I wrote to the Premier, the Treasurer and the Minister for Manufacturing and Innovation in South Australia. Luckily, the South Australian government came to the table. The Weatherill government offered support to Rossi Boots to the tune of $250,000. This funding was to allow the company, Rossi Boots, to expand the market for its elastic-sided boot, creating the opportunity for an extra 10 to 15 jobs, and securing the company the ability to manufacture in South Australia, to continue employing South Australians and to continue to put money into the economy in South Australia. The flow-on benefits in terms of jobs, innovation investments and economic growth are what South Australia need. I thank the state government for its generous support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rossi and similar companies are not asking for handouts; all they want is a level playing field where they can compete. I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker, our products here in Australia are just as good as anyone else's from overseas, if not better. This comes down, of course, to a number of factors. I call on the federal government to take a serious look at the procurement policies that are in place to ensure it recognises the immense value for money local companies like Rossi Boots provide to our economy. Value for money is about more than just a figure on an invoice. For example, it is about the taxes paid by people who work locally. It is about putting money back into the economy. It is about a locally made product that helps invest in this nation. It is also about the value a contract provides to our communities and the jobs it creates in our economy, in our neighbourhoods and in our seats. The flow-on benefits in terms of jobs, innovation, investment and social cohesion should be factors in evaluating such bids.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty-seven million dollars of footwear tenders are on offer with Defence and uniformed agencies next year. That presents a great opportunity to right this wrong. It is a chance for South Australia to continue to strengthen job creation and manufacturing in our state. It is a chance for a company like Rossi to secure a great contract. It would mean that they would employ more people and that they would put more money back into the economy. It would be good for all of us.
