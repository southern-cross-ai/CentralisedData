       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge Frances Belle Parker. Frances is an artist, a mother and proud Yaegl woman from Maclean. Frances was born to Tony and Lenore. Tony was a respected barrister with the Aboriginal Legal Service, and Lenore, a Yaegl woman, was a midwife and diabetes educator before retiring and becoming an Anglican priest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Frances has been a practising artist for the past 20 years. Her works include paintings, printing, sculpture, installations and public works. Her art has been exhibited across Australia and internationally. At just 18, Frances won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Prize" rel="nofollow">
         Blake Prize
        </a>
        . This achievement made her the youngest-ever winner and the first Indigenous recipient in the prize's history. Frances has also designed and screened her digital work
        <i>
         Angwirri
        </i>
        on the sails of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Opera House
        </a>
        . She has recently been selected for a significant art and story-telling project along the northern beaches of the Sydney coastline walk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Frances carries on the legacy of her late cousin Jessica Birk, who sadly passed away in 2019. Jess grew up on the northern beaches, and Frances has said her current project is another way for her to continue her legacy, using elements of Jess's designs in her artwork. Frances has said that she feels as though Jess is still with her and guiding her. Frances calls Yaegl country her home, with her husband, Mason, and her two children, Libby and Addie. Congratulations, Frances.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge Pat Leadbeater, who was recently given life membership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_Brothers" rel="nofollow">
         Marist Brothers
        </a>
        rugby league club. Pat has been actively involved with the Marist Brothers from a young age. He got involved at the age of just 10, when he started playing cricket. Then, at 15, he joined the baseball team. He's also a life member of the baseball and cricket associations and the Far North Coast Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association. In 2015, Pat was presented with the inaugural legends award from the Far North Coast Baseball Association for his services to the game.
       </p>
       <p>
        He's one of seven children. His siblings are Sue, Paul, Louise, Selinda, Francesca and Lucy. Despite having an intellectual disability, Pat has lived an independent life and lives in Lismore with his partner, Lexie. For 20 years he worked for Lismore City Council's parks and gardens. His sister has said that he is humble and knows everyone. She describes him as a local living legend. Pat, thank you for your contribution and devotion to our local sport and congratulations on your life membership.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge Gail Sear from Casino, who's retiring from Kwong Sing &amp; Co after 50 years. Gail has fitted and assisted many generations of women in the lingerie department. She will work her last shift at Kwong Sing on
