        <p>
         I thank the member for her question. Safe, strong and successful local communities are our government's goal for all Australians. But the gap between outcomes in Indigenous communities and other Australian communities has, unfortunately, proved an obstinate challenge for successive governments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, our government has outlined a practical implementation plan. It's a $1 billion commitment to action and accountability on truly closing the gap. It methodically sets outcomes that have been developed in partnership with Indigenous community leaders. These outcomes are on health, education, employment, cultural connection and, most importantly, safety. The right to feel safe in our homes and communities is fundamental, especially for women and children.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today's plan sets a target to at least halve all forms of family violence and abuse against Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         women and children over the next decade. It's a crucial goal as we progress towards further reductions. As with all aspects of the implementation plan, this goal will be driven by Indigenous partnerships. In that regard, we acknowledge and welcome the
         <i>
          Women's Voices
         </i>
         report, which was finalised last year. It was informed by a nationwide consultation process with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and girls, and will be used to inform future policies, including the next National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. We've already invested $1.1 billion as a down payment on that plan, which will be further developed at the national women's safety summit next month.
        </p>
        <p>
         The plan is, of course, part of the Women's Budget Statement, which includes many practical measures to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to achieve economic independence. Just a couple of examples include over $63 million to provide an extra 2,700 places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander girls and young women to participate in girls academies or close to $14 million to establish an early stage social enterprise foundation, helping Indigenous women get the financing to set up new businesses to improve their economic security. Practical programs like these, together with the implementation plan we've set out today, will ensure ongoing support for Indigenous women as they lead their communities in an effort to close the gap and create a safer and stronger future.
