         I thank the member for his question. The matter of road safety, I know, is an important one to the member and to each and every member in this place. In his inaugural speech, the member for Lyne emphasised the importance of infrastructure investment in improving road safety. I also acknowledge the work of the member for Cowper as the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on

         . I acknowledge Senator Alex Gallacher in the other place for what he has always said about road safety. I acknowledge the member for

         Road safety is paramount to each and every Australian, regardless of where you live. Our upgrades to the

         in the member for Lyne's electorate have reduced fatalities by more than half. This is a significant and positive outcome for those communities and industries that rely on the Pacific Highway for essential travel. One life lost on the roads is one too many. One injury is one too many.

           I hear 'hear, hear' from the Leader of the Opposition, and I know how invested he is in road safety measures too. I know we have been as one on the

           and other important work that we are doing. Too many families have been touched by losing a family member, a loved one, a colleague or a friend.

           In this year's budget, I know the government was very, very pleased to announce $2 billion in road safety upgrades. That's $2,000 million that is going to go to important work in improving road safety measures for regional areas. This will include works such as shoulder sealing, rumble strips and physical barriers which can prevent vehicles from detouring off and prevent head-on collisions and the like. In urban areas, works will focus on separating vulnerable users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, from vehicular traffic. President of the

           said, 'We congratulate the federal government on having a clear focus on road safety, especially for our extensive rural and regional network, which will make a real difference in so many ways.'
          </p>
          <p>
           The additional funding builds upon our $500 million targeted road safety program which is rolling out now. There is $2 billion split over three tranches, making sure that the money is going to be spent as a 'use it or lose it' system. We want the states and territories to get on with shovel-ready projects that are going to improve road safety outcomes for all Australians, whether they live in regional areas or metropolitan cities. We will continue to invest in road safety to align with and to support states and territories in working towards
