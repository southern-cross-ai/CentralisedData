         Earlier today I circulated amendments in the same format that they were circulated when this package of bills was last debated before the House. As the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker" rel="nofollow">
          Speaker
         </a>
         pointed out in some part during this debate, those amendments were in a different form to the amendments moved in December because of the particular standing order that the Speaker ruled on at that time in December, and I want to acknowledge the point the Speaker rightly made. It is worth making a few comments about an emissions trading scheme that has been moved. I move opposition amendments (1) to (4) to the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 together:

          <p>
           The government is moving these amendments to provide greater clarity on how business should pass on all carbon tax repeal savings. We are doing it to make sure that there is no doubt that Australian families, Australian businesses and Australian pensioners will receive the full benefit of the carbon tax repeal. The amendment complements the already existing powers that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           has been given by the government through the broader legislative repeal package. In particular, the amendments moved here include guarantees that large retailers of regulated goods, electricity and natural gas, and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases must pass on all cost savings. They introduce a penalty on electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on, and they require electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers as to how they are passing on cost savings.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments will ensure there is no doubt as to who is covered by the obligations regarding electricity, gas and synthetic greenhouse gas bulk importers. The changes to the bill balance new compliance obligations with the need to ensure that household and business customers benefit. They are a light touch approach, but they carry with them an extra capacity. Businesses should be able to explain to customers how changes in their costs are flowing through to changes in their prices. The government is aware that major electricity and gas retailers are already committed to providing this information to households and businesses on bills, inserts and websites.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, I confirm that the definition of electricity retailer is limited to electricity retailers and electricity producers selling electricity into a wholesale electricity market to a retailer. By agreement, this is not intended to override any pre-existing contract. For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, I also confirm that bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gas defined under section 13A(2)(c) of the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 are covered by the new requirements. The cost of synthetic greenhouse gases was significantly impacted by the carbon tax; therefore, to minimise the cost of compliance, small imports of synthetic greenhouse gases—such as imports of synthetic greenhouse gas contained in equipment such as refrigerators, cars and air conditioners—are not covered.
          </p>
          <p>
           In finishing this debate for the government, I wish to make two points. Firstly, I wish to think the ACCC, which I have not previously thanked, as a professional, independent organisation led by Rod Sims and Brenton Philp. They have provided invaluable impartial and professional policy advice. Secondly, I want to take a different tack to what has characterised much of this debate. There is much agreement across this chamber and across this parliament and much goodwill about reducing emissions, and we should always remember that the commitment on both sides of this chamber is to reduce emissions in the lowest cost way. We disagree on the mechanisms—we have voted on the mechanisms, the community has voted on the mechanisms—but the intention is clear: to reduce our emissions, but to find a way that does it which is cost-effective and which is effective in actually reducing those emissions. For all of these reasons, I commend the bills and I commend the amendments to the House.

           <p>
            I will make some remarks about the government's amendments, which we have only been able to look at in the last hour or two. As I think was mentioned earlier in the debate, there has obviously been a deal of discussion about this over the past three or four days, since the debacle in the Senate last week. We are now a little bit clearer on quite how wide the scope of the guarantee of any price reductions that would flow from these repeal bills passing would be for Australian households—it is quite clear that it is a pretty narrow scope—and also on what the range of businesses would be who would be involved in the quite significant compliance obligations that are included in this deal that the government has now done with the Palmer United Party.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is clear looking at these amendments is that the legal obligations apply to a very limited number of businesses in the electricity, the gas and the SGG industries. That is fine, so far as it goes, and the opposition can indicate that we will be supporting these amendments. But let us be crystal clear about this: these amendments do not in any way come close to matching up to the claims made and the commitments given by the now Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition about what the impact of a carbon price mechanism would be, or was, in the grocery sector, in the airline sector, in the housing construction sector, in the farm sector and many others beside. They do not come close to matching those claims and they certainly do not do anything to deliver the commitment that the Prime Minister made in all of those sectors that what apparently went up—not that we accept that they did go up—would come down and that here would be enforcement mechanisms put in place to ensure that those prices came down.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had a discussion about this in question time.

            </a>
            Vasta, you would remember that the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, claimed that the carbon price mechanism would result in grocery bills going up by $10 per week—a claim not echoed or reflected in any other advice or modelling able to be found, but a claim made very clearly by that then Leader of the Opposition, along with a guarantee that these repeal bills would deliver a commensurate reduction in grocery bills. There is nothing in the amendments that in any way obliges Woolworths, Coles or any other retailer to deliver any price reduction whatsoever. There is nothing in the amendments that obliges an airline to deliver any price reduction, that obliges the housing industry to deliver the $6,000 reduction in new house prices that the Prime Minister again committed to in question time today. So we will support the amendments, but it must be clearly stated that the amendments do not reflect the hyperbole, the overreach, the hysterical claims and commitments made by this Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given that this is the third time these bills have come through this House, I have had many an occasion to talk about Labor's

            amendment. Every time we have occasion to debate this, the case for an emissions trading scheme becomes stronger because increasingly around the world this is being recognised as the best policy response to the challenge of climate change that exists. The combination of rigour around carbon pollution in the form of a legal cap that is calibrated to our international commitments around reducing carbon pollution along with a market mechanism—not a series of decisions made in the minister's office or the Prime Minister's office, but a true market mechanism where business works out the cheapest and most effective way to operate within this cap—is not only the mechanism that has been put in place for some years now in our oldest trading partners, like the United Kingdom, France, Germany and many parts of

            </a>
            , such as California, many states in the north-east of the United States and Canadian provinces. We are also seeing it in our own region, most importantly in China, our largest trading partner.

            , our third-largest export partner, will be commencing a very significant national emissions trading scheme in only a matter of five or six months.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the policy we took to the election. It is the right policy for Australia. It is pretty clear that it will not be carried by the parliament today, but the Labor Party is very clear: this is the type of response Australia will eventually come to—maybe not under this Prime Minister but under a more far-sighted one than we have today.

             The amendments being considered before the House today are just further evidence of this government's shameful abrogation of its responsibility to future generations of Australians. The fact is

             Rather than consulting widely with economists and environmental experts, he cobbled together a 1950s era policy and gave it a 1950s name—Direct Action. When released, the policy was widely condemned by economists and environmental groups as being both ineffective and expensive. It is worth reflecting in this debate on the comments at a time from the member for Wentworth about the policy farce that we are left with today. The member for Wentworth belled the cat in 2009 when he stated:

             is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is "crap" and you don't need to do anything about it. Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing.

             Quite a contrast with the statements the Minister for the Environment made earlier!

             opposition did have three years to listen to the experts and the response that Direct Action received after it was initially announced. They had a chance to formulate a policy that may have actually been effective. Of course, they were not interested. They had their fig leaf on climate policy. They would hold onto it without shame even when it did less to cover up their climate cowardice than a pair of red Speedos. Unfortunately, it underwent very little change in the following three years. There was no research produced to demonstrate the policy's effectiveness; no modelling released to demonstrate the impact it would have on carbon emissions. Even Liberal backbenchers questioned its effectiveness, with Liberal MP Mal Washer claiming in May 2013, 'if we are not going to get a big environmental bang for our buck, then we ought not to do it'. The member for Tangney admitted at the same time that the Direct Action Plan was 'not optimal policy' and argued, 'I think there is room to manoeuvre, after the election, on direct action'. Sadly, the only manoeuvres we have seen recently have been with the Palmer United Party, and they have not been on the direct action policy.
            </p>
            <p>
             As with many of Tony Abbott's signature policies, this criticism was not limited to the party floor. Liberals of all stripes came out against the policies, including the patron of many of those opposite and former Treasurer,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
              Peter Costello
             </a>
             , who criticised the affordability of the scheme. The Abbott government continued to ignore the strident criticism from both sides of the political plan, and stuck with its direct-action albatross. However, once the coalition won government, it was time to turn this afterthought of an election promise into a coherent government policy for combating climate change. During the implementation process we have seen not only the results of this shoddy policy but also its smokescreen effect—it has turned a small farming program, the Carbon Farming Initiative, into a showpiece of the coalition's climate change policy: the Emissions Reduction Fund. Even this fund is riddled with policy errors. It is a fund that is missing key elements as to how it will operate, such as how historical baselines are set and how credits are to be calculated. It is a fund that takes control of key aspects away from an independent body and gives that control to a very partisan minister—key aspects such as eligibility for the funds allocated, and the calculation of carbon credits. It is a fund that is not even clear about how much money it has to spend.
            </p>
            <p>
             The most damning entitlement of this policy is that there are no binding caps whatsoever. The money spent under their direct action policy could be spent on magic beans, for all those opposite care. Magic beans do nothing to reduce our carbon emissions in this country but cost the taxpayer billions at the end of the day. The coalition's direct action policy is a poorly modelled piece of policy which has been roundly condemned by experts around the country. A senate inquiry into the Emissions Reduction Fund firmly recommended that the government not proceed with this unfortunate policy. Expert after expert in this inquiry reiterated how ineffective and expensive the scheme would be. Not one single expert called to the inquiry supported the government's plans, or expressed the belief that it would enable the government to reach its emissions reductions targets. Even the government's own department has expressed disbelief, and at a recent senate estimates hearing admitted that they are unable to confirm the policy will reach their targets—it just does not add up to a pile of magic beans, Mr

              History will condemn this government; and I feel extraordinarily proud to have voted to keep the world-leading price on pollution that we have. I rise to speak on the Greens amendments to the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Amendment Bill 2014. Much of the debate so far on this bill and related bills has centred around the price on pollution, but there is one other aspect to this bill that deserves attention.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
               ARENA
              </a>
              , the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, is doing amazing work. If you ever wanted an example of 'direct action' in practice, it is ARENA.
             </p>
             <p>
              ARENA is an organisation that was established at the Greens' request, under the previous arrangement reached with the Labor government, to ensure that $3 billion would be put aside to develop renewable energy in this country, especially that early-stage research. That agency now exists—at arm's length from a minister, so it cannot be politicised—and it is driving solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy in Australia. Of the initial $3-billion budget, $1.8 billion will be lost if this bill goes ahead—that is, $717 million over the next three years. Where is that money being spent? What are the kinds of things that ARENA is doing which will be at risk if the amendments I have moved to this bill are not passed? Well, just recently, researchers in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              found a way to heat steam, using solar, to a point where that steam was able to drive turbines. What does that mean? It means that, if this technology is able to be proven and commercialised, existing coal-fired power stations could be run by solar—the existing turbines in those stations could be powered by steam produced by the sun. That is just one of ARENA's projects. There are 64 solar projects going on around the country: 14 bioenergy, 19 hybrid projects, six ocean and wave projects, and six geothermal projects—all being supported by ARENA.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seventy per cent of ARENA funding has gone to regional and rural Australia. Members opposite who represent those regional and rural electorates where this money is going—and driving the shift to renewable energy, and actually making a difference—are about to cut $1.8 billion from their communities.
             </p>
             <p>
              What ARENA is doing is the first stage in the chain: helping research into renewable technologies—things like storage, geothermal and solar— so that Australia can become a renewable energy world leader. And then, when those projects are proven to work, some of those projects can then go and get funding from the second stage—the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. What we have at the moment is, in fact, an ecosystem that supports the development and then the commercialisation of clean and renewable energies in this country. Whatever your ideological commitment to repealing the carbon tax—or however you want to put it—I do not think that people knew, at the election, that they were voting for ripping out $1.8 billion from solar and geothermal energy around this country. That is not what they voted for. That was not put up in lights in the coalition's policy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whatever one thinks about the other matters before us here today, I urge the House to support the amendments that will restore the funding to ARENA. We know now, because of a decision made by senators in the other place, that ARENA is going to stay. The government's efforts to repeal and abolish ARENA through separate legislation will not work. Given that ARENA is going to stay, we now need to give it back the funding that it was relying on—so that solar, geothermal and wave power in Australia can become world-leading.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have had the privilege of meeting a number of people in the course of my time here. One of them was the climate adviser to the G8, and to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel" rel="nofollow">

              , who said: 'We Germans look at you Australians, and we cannot understand, with all your sun and your wind and your waves, why you are not leading the world in renewable energy.' Well, keep ARENA—and maybe we can.
