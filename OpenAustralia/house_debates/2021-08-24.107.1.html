         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        —the committee—for its comprehensive review of the bill. The government has prepared amendments in response to recommendations made by the committee. The amendments I move today will enhance oversight of powers contained in the bill. In line with the committee's recommendations, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor—the INSLM—will commence a review of the powers in this bill within three years of the bill receiving royal assent. The PJCIS also has the option of reviewing the bill after four years from the bill receiving royal assent, and the powers will sunset five years from the date of royal assent. I am also introducing a series of amendments to give effect to a number of the committee's recommendations which focused on strengthening arrangements for when these new powers can be applied for and issued. These amendments will strengthen the issuing criteria for data disruption warrants to include that the disruption of the data is reasonably necessary and proportionate; require additional matters to be specified in an application for data disruption and account takeover warrants, including, for example, the type of acts of data disruption that are proposed to be carried out under the warrant; and provide that an application for a data disruption warrant must be endorsed by a sufficiently senior officer who is of a rank that has been approved by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and who has completed the necessary training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments are also being introduced to strengthen protection for third parties and journalists. These amendments will ensure that loss or damage to innocent third parties as a result of a data disruption warrant can be caused only to the extent to which it is necessary and proportionate and will require notification of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, if this occurs; strengthen the issuing criteria for network activity warrants to include consideration of privacy implications, to the extent known, where the warrant is likely to result in access to data of persons who are lawfully using a computer; strengthen the issuing criteria for data disruption and account takeover warrants to include consideration of whether the power is likely to have an adverse impact on third parties, including privacy implications, to the extent known; and provide an additional public interest test for data disruption warrants, network activity warrants and account takeover warrants where an investigation of an unauthorised disclosure offence is in relation to a person working in a professional capacity as a journalist. On the issue of providing greater protection for journalists, I note that the government is committed to implementing the recommendations from the PJCIS press freedoms report, including the expansion of the public interest advocate regime. This issue is most appropriately addressed across all aspects of the electronic surveillance framework and will be progressed alongside holistic reforms to Australia's electronic surveillance laws which are already underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Government amendments being introduced today also address a range of the committee's recommendations in relation to assistance orders. These amendments will require assistance orders for data disruption warrants to be reasonably necessary to enable the warrant to be executed and the assistance sought to be justifiable and proportionate; require that issuing authorities consider whether a person is, or has been, subject to other mandatory assistance orders, to the extent known; clarify that a person may only be subject to an assistance order while a warrant or an emergency authorisation is in force; and provide protection from civil liability in respect of an act done in compliance with an assistance order or in good faith with an assistance order.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of the amendments I have outlined is intended to address the concerns identified by the committee which led to its recommendations. I particularly note recommendations 10 and 30, which were of significant focus during the committee's consideration of the bill. The government has worked in good faith to address the committee's concerns. The amendments I have introduced ensure that warrants for the new powers are more likely to be issued for more serious crime types whilst still being available to fight all forms of serious crime and to tighten the definition of 'criminal network of individuals' whilst still enabling valuable criminal intelligence to be collected. These amendments, like many others being introduced today, balance essential safeguards with the need to preserve the operational effectiveness of the new powers.

        These government amendments do not address all of the committee's recommendations. In particular, the committee made a number of recommendations proposing to expand the oversight role of the committee to the intelligence functions of the ACIC and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        and extend the oversight remit of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to include all intelligence functions of the AFP. The ACIC and AFP are already subject to extensive parliamentary oversight, including by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
         Law Enforcement
        </a>
        . Expanding IGIS oversight to all of the AFP's intelligence functions is contrary to the recommendations of the comprehensive review of the framework governing the National Intelligence Community and the government's public response to those recommendations.

        In addition, there were several recommendations made by the committee which are more appropriately considered as part of the holistic review of Australia's electronic surveillance framework currently underway. These include recommendations to expand the function of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to cover the proprietary of the AFP's and ACIC's policies and activities, remove the ability for AAT members to issue warrants under the bill and change postwarrant concealment powers.

        I also note the committee's recommendation that my department not make further submissions that are provided on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        portfolio. Joint submissions have been longstanding practice of previous governments and remain appropriate today. Portfolio submissions provide the committee and public with a comprehensive overview of the operational, policy and legislative issues, all of which must be understood and considered as a whole for good policy development. I believe the Australian people expect the government to act in a coordinated and coherent way. This approach does not preclude portfolio agencies also providing additional submissions, as they did for this bill, to further assist the committee's consideration of specific operational issues.

        I'm also taking this opportunity to introduce two additional government amendments. The first makes minor amendments to the National Emergency Declaration Act 2020 to clarify that the minister's power to modify administrative arrangement requirements during a national emergency does not apply to apply to account takeover warrants. The second would amend the frequency of the Ombudsman's inspection of records relating to account takeover warrants and subsequent reports to the minister on these inspections from six to 12 monthly. The Ombudsman raised this amendment with the committee during its inquiry as giving the Ombudsman more flexibility in how it conducts its essential oversight role. Making this change is consistent with recommendation 17 of the committee on the frequency of agency reporting.

        The new powers introduced by this bill are critical in enabling law enforcement to tackle the fundamental shift in how serious criminality is occurring online. Without enhancing the AFP's and ACIC's powers, we leave them with outdated ways of attacking an area of criminality that is only increasing in prevalence. I commend these amendments to the House.
