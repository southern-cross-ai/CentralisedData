       <p>
        On indulgence—at the conclusion of the 43rd Parliament I wish to make the point that we are concluding at 5 pm at the end of a parliamentary term for the first time since I have been a member of parliament. That is indicative that, whatever statements have been made about this parliament, it has functioned effectively. I thank all members of the House, particularly the members of the government but also the Manager of Opposition Business for his courtesy in the way that he has conducted himself with me in managing the business of this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to single out the constructive way in which the crossbenchers have played a role in this parliament. In particular, I congratulate Speaker Jenkins, Speaker Slipper and you, Speaker Burke—all three—on the way that you have presided over this chamber. I also thank Clerk extraordinaire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Wright" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and all involved with the functioning of the parliament. The parliament is now concluded, and I think it is appropriate that the parliament conclude with a very positive message, which is that during the days ahead I hope that we have more civility in Australian politics and that we bear that in mind when we return for the 44th Parliament, which I am looking forward to serving in.

        <p>
         I just want to add to the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister on behalf of myself and the former Speakers in this parliament. This place cannot function without the magnificent staff in this building. They have risen to the challenge that the hung parliament has presented to them. They have done it with amazing grace and with amazing dignity, intelligence and perseverance at all hours of the day and night. I think everybody in the Australian public owes them a great deal of thanks.
