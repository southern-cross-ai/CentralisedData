        ’s College in Darwin for five years. I was a school vice captain and played

        for the school. I am still friends with many of the staff: Greg O’Mullane, Leigh and Glenda Lockley, and Noel and Carol Muller. The Mullers have committed much of their working lives to the school. Mr Ralph Braithwaite, who recently retired after more than 30 years service, was instrumental in the administration of the college.
       </p>
       <p>
        Celebrations throughout the year highlight the work of the OLSH sisters in establishing schools across the Territory and the development and history of all Catholic schools. Today, there are 15 Catholic schools throughout the NT: 10 urban schools and five Indigenous Catholic community schools. In 1908 the first Catholic school,

        </a>
        . 1 July 2007 is a significant date in the history of Catholic education and marks the commencement of the agreement to transfer five Catholic remote schools to the Catholic systemic model, following negotiations between the Australian and Northern Territory governments. These five schools were previously funded under the 1979 Mission Schools Agreement.

       <p>
        Staff, students and the community are all welcome to become involved in the celebrations. Activities will include a Eucharistic mass, a formal history of the school and centenary awards in recognition of service and outstanding commitment to the school. A dinner and a performing arts festival showcasing the talents of the students will take place on 19 September.

        I congratulate everyone involved in the 100 years of Catholic education in the Northern Territory. During 2008, the National

        </a>
        will provide an opportunity to recognise the icons of Catholic education and to recognise long-term service in Catholic education across the Territory. I seek leave to table the timeline of the development of Catholic schools in the Northern Territory.
