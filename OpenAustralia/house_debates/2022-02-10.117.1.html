       <p>
        An important part of my plan for Ryan is protecting our local lifestyle, protecting our community so my kids and their kids grow up enjoying everything I did and more. The local environment is one of the most important aspects of this incredible lifestyle that we enjoy in Brisbane's western suburbs. Over the last few years I have worked to keep our local environment clean and green as well as contribute to our national targets to transition to renewable energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investing in clean energy sources is an important part of Australia's long-term emissions reduction plan to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. Australians are already playing their part in that. We have the highest rooftop solar uptake in the world. One in four Australians have solar on their home, and I am pleased to be one of them. We're also putting practical solutions into the hands of local community groups and businesses as well as households—solutions that not only reduce our carbon footprint but also lower electricity costs so that Australians can get back to the things that matter most and not worry about their power bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local not-for-profit organisations are the heart of our community in the Ryan electorate. I am proud to have secured $67,000 for these organisations to improve their energy-efficiency practices and technologies. The Morrison government's Powering Communities Program provides funding to not-for-profit organisations to reduce their energy use, improve energy productivity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. These organisations can use these funds to upgrade equipment to reduce energy consumption, to invest in energy monitoring and management systems and to invest in on-site renewable energy and solar connected batteries.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are some of the upgrades that I have fought hard to see funded in our local area. The West Toowong Bowls Club has purchased energy-efficient equipment. The Bellbowrie Moggill Men's Shed, the Pullenvale Progress Association, the Riverside family church, the Toowong Uniting Church, the Kenmore District Kindergarten and C&amp;K Indooroopilly—a very diverse group of community organisations—have all installed brand-new solar panel systems thanks to the support of the Morrison government. It was particularly fantastic to hear that the Kenmore District Kindergarten was not only getting benefit from its solar panels on emissions and reducing its energy costs but using them to help educate our next generation on the important steps you can take to protect the local environment. I myself have these conversations with my son, Theo, who at four is already a bit of an expert.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was pleased to show the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, the member for Goldstein, the McIntyre Centre's new solar panels and to speak about the impact these new solar panels will have for the centre. It takes money out of power bills and invests it in those community groups that need it the most.
