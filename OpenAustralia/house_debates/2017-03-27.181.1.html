       <p>
        Recently I was proud to present national medals to Pam Ditton, Joy Taylor, Rodney Syl Reid and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Hughes" rel="nofollow">
         Len Hughes
        </a>
        in recognition of their long service to Marine Rescue Cape Byron. The presentation took place at the Cape Byron Bay Lighthouse. Between them, they have amassed more than 60 years of service to the organisation, providing experienced and vital emergency services to our coastal community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Len Hughes was with Marine Rescue Cape Byron until late 2015. Pam Ditton became a training officer, and she trained all new members in procedures in addition to conducting regular radio shifts. Joy Taylor volunteered as treasurer when she transferred, carrying out fundraising with her husband, Ted, every Tuesday, Wednesday and on Byron market days as well. Rodney Syl Reid served with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        from 1967 until 1987 and is now both watch officer and rescue controller with Marine Rescue. He has been involved in so many rescues.

        </a>
        volunteers are recognised for their marine skills, their experience and their commitment to saving lives on the water. Through their many key services, they provide a swift, coordinated emergency response 24 hours a day. They also monitor along the coastline and are involved in boating safety and education.

        In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , there are more than 3,000 volunteers in 45 strategically-located units, watching over the state's most popular boating, fishing and cruising regions. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the medal recipients on that day and, indeed, all the members of Marine Rescue Cape Byron and those throughout New South Wales for their tireless service to our community.
