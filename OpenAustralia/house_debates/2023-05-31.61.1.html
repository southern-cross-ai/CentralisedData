        My question is to the Prime Minister. Earlier today the House passed the Constitution alteration bill. How will recognition of Aboriginal and

         I thank the member for Robertson for his question, for his leadership as a fine new representative of the people of Robertson in this House and for his leadership on this issue. Six years ago at Uluru, Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         people invited all Australians to walk together toward a better future. The 'yes' that we heard here this morning was a great step forward on that journey together as a nation. This referendum can be a moment of national unity, just as the Apology was—an extraordinary opportunity for every Australian to be counted and heard, to own this change and be proud of it and to truly live the spirit of the fair go. Today's progress is the result of a grassroots movement, the culmination of years of discussion, consultation and hard work by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is not something that began in Canberra. This certainly has not been rushed into. It is a response to a gracious request from our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—an invitation built on a desire to bring us all closer together as a people reconciled and to lift our great nation to even greater heights.

         This referendum is about two things. It's about recognition in our Constitution, something other advanced economies that became colonies in past centuries did a long time ago:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         , way back in the 19th century, and Canada, in the last century. We are the only advanced economy that has not done that. The referendum is also about listening.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , when they met together at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         constitutional convention, decided not just that they wanted recognition but also the form of it. And the form they requested us to grant for them was a voice, an opportunity for us to listen to them about matters that affect their lives, about matters that go to the heart of the need to close the gap between Indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice" rel="nofollow">
          The Voice

         is the means to an end. The end is about closing the gap.

         As the Solicitor-General said, it will enhance our system of representative government.

         alteration bill will now go to the Senate, and soon this extraordinary journey that began so far from parliament will return to the people, and it will be the people who decide. Today this House said yes to holding a referendum. We look forward to the Australia people saying yes to recognition.
