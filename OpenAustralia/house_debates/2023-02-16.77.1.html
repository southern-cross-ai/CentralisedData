        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his previous answer. If the Prime Minister is happy to claim credit for increases in employment since the election, why is he not prepared to take responsibility for the eight consecutive increases in interest rates on his watch?

         They are very predictable. Each and every day, question No. 1 is from the Leader of the Opposition and question No. 2 is from the deputy leader. We then go to the crossbenchers. Then we have question No. 3 from the opposition from the shadow Treasurer, not to the Treasurer but to me. Then we go to the back, and then they think about what they'll do.

         I say to the member for Bradfield, congratulations on giving yourself the MPI.

            Resume your seat. That was not a point of order. It was not stated. I'm going to keep going. I give the call to the Prime Minister.

            <p>
             Certainly it is a fact that inflation causes pain to people, and interest rates, when they're 3.35 per cent, compared with where they were, are placing pressure on families, just as on the Leader of the Opposition's watch they were 6.75 per cent. They were 6.75 compared with 3.35.

             Those opposite come into this chamber and decide on their tactics.

              The Manager
             </a>
             of Opposition Business, who asked this question, is in charge of their tactics in this place. They come in and they vote against every piece of legislation that would make a difference to people. They voted against assistance in our housing package. They voted against the National Reconstruction Fund. They voted against energy price relief. They voted against industrial relations changes which were aimed at lifting wages. They vote against every initiative that is put forward.
            </p>
            <p>
             But there is some hope, I say to colleagues. There is some hope because the Leader of the Opposition has not done an MPI since he took that high officeâ€”not one. But, this afternoon, don't be alarmed if the oxygen masks drop from above; it will just be because the member for Bradfield is speaking!
