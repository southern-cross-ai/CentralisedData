        One of the joys of working closely with community organisations in northern Tasmania is seeing the tangible difference they make on the ground. In the outer suburbs of Launceston, Starting Point Neighbourhood House and the Northern Suburbs Community Centre implemented a very successful pilot program named Adventure Play, working with disengaged or at-risk youth. The aim of the Adventure Play program is to assist children to overcome mental health and trauma issues by increasing positive healthy behaviours through physical activity. Denise Delphin, the wonderful general manager of the Northern Suburbs Community Centre, said that the evidence based program has already shown results. 'You can see the young people flourishing, growing, developing, gaining confidence and channelling some of their emotions in positive ways,' Denise said. They've also noted improvements in attendance at school. Young people are offered a range of sport and other recreational activities, including rock climbing and abseilingâ€”activities that they may not otherwise have access to. I was thrilled last month to announce that this wonderful program is the recipient of significant funding through our government's driving of social inclusion through the Sport and Physical Activity Grant Program. Importantly, this partnership will employ four staff and will collaborate with local schools to involve children and young people who could benefit most from the program. Funding for this program allows the community organisations to further support those most in need, working together for a more resilient and connected life.
