        I rise to acknowledge a wonderful community resource in my electorate, known at the Banksia Gardens Community Services. I am sure that every member of this House has at least one neighbourhood house working for and within their local community. I am lucky to have at least seven—several actually—doing a wonderful and fantastic job in providing formal and informal learning opportunities. They are a space for social engagement and a range of resources to link community members together in joined endeavours. Banksia Gardens, of all those neighbourhood houses, is a very special place. It is a hive of activity and engagement and a shining example of how innovative the community sector can be. Banksia Gardens was recently nominated in the Learn Local Awards of the Victorian government award. It received a commendation in the outstanding organisation category.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of its highly successful programs include a homework club for school students, school holiday programs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAL" rel="nofollow">
         VCAL
        </a>
        classes for students wishing to complete secondary education outside the formal school structure, accredited vocational training in children's studies, computer classes for older residents, multicultural playgroups, employment programs and Community Connections, a dynamic program that is working to build a safe, cooperative and supportive neighbourhood within Banksia public housing estate. I recently nominated the Community Connections program for a community justice award for the innovative way it has worked to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour in an area that was once notorious for being unsafe and intimidating.

        The Banksia Gardens study group has well over 100 young people receiving academic support on a regular basis. Several young people, as well as parents, have reported significant improvements in academic performance. Recently, an additional program called Aiming High has been introduced, geared specifically to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Certificate of Education
        </a>
        students who have been identified by their school as having significant potential to excel. Apart from intensive tutoring, Aiming High aims to provide students with broader support, including support with scholarship and university applications.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bring the Gardens to the Valley program provides academic and social opportunities for students with a disability, including a homework and activities club. The Girls Circle is a 10-week personal development group program for girls aged 10 to 14 looking at issues such as self-esteem, body image, healthy lifestyles and managing and expressing emotion. It has been so successful that the centre is looking to start a similar program for boys. The centre's work experience projects, training and supports for the job application process have helped give a number of local people—young and not so young—valuable confidence, practical skills and experience in the quest to find meaningful full-time work.
