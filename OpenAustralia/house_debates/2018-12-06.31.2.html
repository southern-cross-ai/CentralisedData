        At this special time of the year, I would like to thank the many students in Ryan who've contributed to the Christmas spirit. Ryan's annual Christmas Card Competition has recently been 'wrapped up'. We had hundreds of entries from all across the electorate, and I must say that the standard was of a very high quality. Congratulations to the aptly named Eliza Claus, Jack Cahill and Felicity Enever, who, along with the runners-up, will have their work distributed to more than 100,000 locals as part of my 2019 calendar. A special thankyou to the community judges, who had such a hard job choosing the winners.

        In recent weeks, my office has also been overwhelmed by Australian Defence Force Christmas cards creatively decorated by local school students. Christmas for our deployed troops is often one of the most difficult times of the year. They will be far from home without their families, and it's important they know that we are all thinking of them. Students showed their appreciation by sending handmade cards for deployed service men and women. It is delightful to see the children so excited to be involved and giving back to the community. I thank the students, parents and teachers for their participation and their role in spreading selflessness and positivity throughout the community at this time.
