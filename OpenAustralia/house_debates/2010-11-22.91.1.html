       <p>
        On 4 November 2010 I received correspondence from Daly International on behalf of Optus. That letter informed me of the intent of Optus to install three panel antennas on the roof of the Woodvale shopping centre in the northern part of Woodvale in Cowan. Optus is keen to improve its 3G network services in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The letter from Daly International stated that a period of consultation with the community and key stakeholders would run from 1 November to 15 November. It is not surprising that despite the proposal being consistent with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
         ACMA
        </a>
        electromagnetic energy exposure level guidelines, the primary school 150 metres away and those who work at the shopping centre were not pleased.
       </p>
       <p>
        A petition was raised and submissions were tendered, indicating comprehensive opposition to the proposal. The issue was raised with me by my constituent Linda Burke, and upon returning home at the end of the last sitting week I visited the local primary school, North Woodvale primary, and spoke with Mr Greg Brice, the principal. After speaking about the issues, I called Optus from Mr Brice’s office and I then had a conversation with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
         Lisa Kelly
        </a>
        from Optus’s corporate and government office. Having discussed the local concerns and alternatives with her, I am pleased with Optus’s response. They will now be pursuing an option elsewhere in Woodvale on an existing tower, and that is a good result.
       </p>
       <p>
        The views and legitimate concerns of local people have been taken into account and I wish Optus all the best with their pursuit of the alternative—a far more practical and better result. I congratulate Optus and all those in Woodvale such as Linda Burke, Greg Brice and the school and wider communities who made such good sense on the issue.
