        In Adelaide, infrastructure upgrades have not kept up with population growth. This is clearly evident today. The roads are increasingly congested and we still have in the metropolitan area the same road network we had 40 years ago. While this was sufficient to carry the traffic 20 years ago, it is not sufficient anymore. Adelaide needs a north-south expressway that can efficiently transport goods and motorists. A north-south corridor in Adelaide has been identified as a key priority by the

        of South Australia and the Southern Adelaide Economic Development Board, a newly formed partnership between the Marion and Onkaparinga councils, which has been set up to forge a new economic direction for southern Adelaide. Recently meeting with the Southern Adelaide Economic Development Board, I was told that, as well as broadband, the issue of a north-south expressway is the major priority for southern Adelaide.

        I am actively supporting the campaign to extend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
         AusLink
        </a>
        network and develop a future plan for a north-south expressway in Adelaide’s metropolitan area. What this requires is a 10½ kilometre extension of the network along

        intersection to South Road at a length of 6½ kilometres. Cross Road is a connecting route from the South Eastern Freeway to South Road. It commutes heavy volumes of traffic. It was upgraded in the mid-nineties to carry this traffic and should be included as part of the AusLink network. Also, South Road is only partly in the AusLink network. It needs to be added so we can prepare for a future north-south expressway that will ease traffic congestion and help southern Adelaide prosper to its full potential. I commend the Australian government for already including part of South Road in the AusLink network, but to cease it at the Sir Donald Bradman Drive intersection does not make sense. Commuters use South Road to get to Darlington,

        and Lonsdale, and that requires travelling south of Sir Donald Bradman Drive.
       </p>
       <p>
        The RAA has flagged the cost at approximately $2 billion. This is obviously a long-term project but one that is critical for South Australia and Adelaide, and for southern Adelaide in particular. What we need is a true long-term blueprint for South Road. Extending the AusLink network to the Southern Expressway is the beginning of developing such a plan. As I travel around Australia I see that the infrastructure in Adelaide has lagged well behind other states. If we do not take this step our roads will continue to deteriorate and become increasingly congested. They will restrict business growth in the southern area and we will continue to lose out on vital business investment.
