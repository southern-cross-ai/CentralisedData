        I rise to speak about the Geelong jobs fair that is going to be held on 20 and 21 June. Before I do I would like to ask the member for Gellibrand to stay for one minute because his constituents and all people in Western Melbourne need to know that the Labor Party is blocking the East West Link, one of the biggest infrastructure projects for our state. What a fantastic project. We are putting $3 billion into that. It will be wonderful for the people of Geelong. It will cut commuter times by some three hours a week, so important for jobs, so important for the local economy. What a shame the member for Gellibrand is not standing by this incredible commitment. The Labor Party are working hard to oppose it, and that is the worst thing that they can do for the people of western Melbourne and for the people of Geelong. And shame on the member for Corio, because he is also blocking this important project. As I said, I rise to talk about jobs and that is a project that will employ more than 6,000 people. Labor, frankly, is again standing in the way of jobs and, frankly, it is an absolute disgrace.

        The jobs fair is a great initiative. As I said, it is being held on 20 and 21 June and I am very proud that the Commonwealth is taking a leading role in funding the jobs fair, along with some important sponsors: the

        , Enterprise Geelong and the City of Greater Geelong. We have had a fantastic response. More than 50 employers have signed up, but we say to all employers across our great region, across Corangamite: we are a region of so many wonderful skills—so much capacity in health, in education, in community services and of course in manufacturing—so I urge all employers to sign up so that they can showcase their opportunities and they can meet the best and brightest in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past six years we have seen a terrible record in employment when it comes to the Labor Party's performance. Some 519,000 jobs lost in small business, another 129,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared under Labor. At a time when manufacturing and traditional manufacturing is under pressure, it is so important to stand up for jobs and to look at a very bright future, and we are very focused on the importance of advanced manufacturing for our region. I urge everyone across Geelong who is looking for a job or who is looking for a great employee to get along to the jobs fair. It is a very important initiative and, coupled with our $155 million growth fund, it is a very important investment in regional infrastructure, in next generation manufacturing. Our government is proudly working very hard for jobs growth.
