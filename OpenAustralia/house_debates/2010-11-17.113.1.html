        On Sunday, 7 November, I had the pleasure of attending
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandin_Yallock" rel="nofollow">
         Wandin Yallock
        </a>
        Primary School’s 140th birthday celebration. Established in 1870, Wandin Yallock Primary School obviously has a wonderful history. It was established just 35 years after the founding of Melbourne and 30 years before Federation. The history of the school is very rich indeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Past and present students, teachers and their families were in attendance on the day. There were even some students from the 1920s and earlier, who retold their stories of a different time in Wandin and at Wandin Yallock Primary School. It was a wonderful day of activities and a wonderful celebration of the history of the school. Murrundindi performed the welcome to country and provided a blessing to the school community. He also was able to describe his family’s connection with Wandin Yallock Primary School back to 1903.
       </p>
       <p>
        One past student at this 140th birthday celebration was 100-year-old Frank Gaudion. He was born in 1910 and he began his schooling in the midst of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        . His great niece, Tania Hodgson, read out his reflections of life and community in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley
        </a>
        way back then. It was a very special moment indeed. Frank talked about his time in 1916 and his memory of the end of the First World War and the beginnings of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        , which of course was just a few days away from the birthday celebration. Frank had the honour of cutting the birthday cake.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people in the school community ensured that this event was a tremendous success. I want to congratulate some of the key organisers for all their hard work and effort. They include Sally Parrot, Amanda Williams, Therese Myring, Sara McPherson, Alicia Mann, Alex Findlay, Georgie Johnson, Cathy Hollingworth, Colleen Garner, Veronica Gamble, Sue Lennie, Peta McKay,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Spargo" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_McKay" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
         Brad Johnson
        </a>
        . Special congratulations go to the school’s principal, Christine Sheil, and to the school council president, Peta McKay, whom I have mentioned. They ensured that the celebrations went incredibly well and without a hitch. I know that there were many other volunteers there on the day, including Tracy, from our local swimming lessons, who was there at the sausage sizzle. The support of these volunteers epitomises the great school community at Wandin Yallock.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I also pay tribute to Croydon Hills Primary School. I had the pleasure of presenting Australian flags to a group of students going on a study and cultural exchange to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        . In fact, they are there as we speak. Croydon Hills Primary School received a $20,000 grant from the Australia-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Korea Foundation
        </a>
        , which has greatly assisted the school to take 20 students on this year’s tour. The students were very excited before they headed off, and I am sure they are having a wonderful time that will be critical to their education. They are young ambassadors not just for their school but for their country. They will bring back not only great stories to tell their school community but also great lessons that will form a part of their education.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate those students: Brilee Barrow, Armelia Botha, Aiden Cruse, Daniel Culshaw, Alyse Dines, Harry Evely, Jessica Hammet, Chris Kadlis, Georgia Kane, Matt Laurie, Sandra Li, Holly Millsom, Stephanie Mortlock Christopher Newlands,

        , Pippa Thompson, Tristan Unwin, Murphy Whitmore and Lauren Woolley. I am sure the students will have a great time while they are in South Korea and will bring back many rich memories for the years to come.
