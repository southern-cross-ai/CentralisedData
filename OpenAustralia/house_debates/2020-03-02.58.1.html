        The people of Australia are getting a bit sick and tired of seeing the Treasurer and the Prime Minister use question time as a forum to practise their amateur acting skills. Outside the problems are mounting: the government promises one thing but simply does not deliver. Remember the promise to do something about getting rid of debt? Well, they've actually doubled it.
