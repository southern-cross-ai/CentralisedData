        Another school year has begun, and I'd like to give a huge shoutout to all the schools in my electorate of Pearce. To all the principals, teachers, staff and volunteers right around Australia, you do an amazing job, and the effort you put in to ensure that our children to receive the best possible educational outcome is very much appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the students, from the youngest just starting out to the seniors in their last year of secondary education, we wish you well. A special message to the year 12s is to take care of themselves this year. Plan to study. The effort you put in early will pay dividends, but also remember to take time out to relax and enjoy the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the parents, I remember what it's like to drop off your youngest for their very first day at schoolâ€”a real bag of mixed emotions. Your support for your children and their local school can make a difference and is, once again, very much appreciated.

        The Albanese Labor government just last week welcomed the

        state government's decision to work with us to fully fund public schools in WA. What a way to commence the year! Every student deserves quality education no matter where they live or their circumstances. We can provide, now, a fairer system and improve excellence in our schools by supporting the wellbeing of students and teachers. I firmly believe the increased funding will help achieve real improvements in our schools. I wish all communities the very best for the 2024 school year. I hope it is very successful and that the students settle in beautifully for this year.
