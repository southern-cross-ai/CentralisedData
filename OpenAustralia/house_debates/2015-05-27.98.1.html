        (1) recognises the:

       <p class="italic">

       </p>

        (b) clear and present threat posed by transnational terrorism in our region;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) sustained efforts of both the

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        (ADF) and our civilian national security agencies to identify, attack and degrade foreign or 'source nation' terrorist threats at the very earliest opportunity, most notably since the 2002 Bali bombings (which claimed the lives of 202 people, including 88 innocent Australians, and injured a further 209);
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) unique geo-political circumstances of Australia which will continue to emphasise the need for cooperative and heightened security vigilance and activity with, by and from our key regional partners and allies, over the long term;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) potential for Australian security forces, both civil and military, to continue to act as effective, practical agents to reinforce, bolster and continually invigorate critical regional partnerships and engagements, toward a stable and prosperous long term regional future, and one which is mutually beneficial to all national participants;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) potential offered by the Government's holistic approach to home-grown terrorism, to constitute a working model for consideration, adaptation as appropriate, and possible implementation, by equally determined Governments and nations, throughout our region;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) need for sustained vigilance and regional engagement by all like-minded nations in our region;

        (h) need to maintain and support both ADF and civilian security agency capabilities, at the very forefront of counter-terrorist operational capacity and capability;

       <p class="italic">
        (i) need for sustained border protection regimes and procedures; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (j) importance of maintaining and sustaining Australia's traditional defence alliance and treaty arrangements;
       </p>

        (2) acknowledges:
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        (b) that the Attorney-General's Department has led and implemented a diverse array of constructive initiatives and measures in support of community safety and resilience, which will further complement 'offshore' counter-terrorist initiatives and endeavours;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government

        actions are in lockstep with sensible international responses to this global trend and challenges; and

        (3) endorses and lends ongoing support to the Government's longstanding efforts to diminish the current and future terrorist threat to all Australians, including the removal of Australian citizenship status from dual citizens who are involved in terrorism in Australia or abroad.

        3 MR HUTCHINSON: To move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Coalition's Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania dated 15 August 2013, committed the Government to creating a Tasmanian Fruit and Vegetable Industry Taskforce focusing on the growth of the fruit and vegetable sectors in Tasmania;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Taskforce will develop an industry-led plan to promote competitiveness, investment and jobs growth in these sectors; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the terms of reference prescribing the scope of the Taskforce included reviewing existing work, drawing conclusions and developing a unified and agreed plan for the Tasmanian fruit and vegetable industries to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) increase grower returns and reduce their costs;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) increase competitiveness, investment and jobs growth across the supply chain; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) develop domestic and export markets;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the vital importance of the agriculture sector to Tasmania, and for all Tasmanians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that Tasmania is an important producer of fruit and vegetables, mainly potatoes, onions, carrots, cherries and other stone fruit, pomefruit and berries;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that in 2011-12, the gross value production of fruit and nuts in Tasmania was $100.8 million, vegetables $213.4 million, and nursery production (nurseries, cut flowers and cultivated turf) $28.4 million, with Tasmania also being an important producer of the special poppy and pyrethrum crops;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that in contrast to other states, exporting and direct sales to processors are the predominant sales channels for fresh produce, for example:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in 2011-12, an estimated 70 per cent of Tasmanian vegetable growers sold their produce directly to a processor (this includes the manufacturing of canned, bottled, preserved, quick frozen or dried vegetable products, dehydrated vegetable products, soups, sauces, pickles and mixed meat and vegetable cereal products, processing and packaging of fresh salads and pan-ready vegetables, as well as bulk packaged and cleaned vegetables); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) approximately 10 per cent for export, which compares with the national average of 26 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) that in 2011-12 only 5 per cent of Tasmanian vegetable farms reported selling direct to state capital wholesale, compared to the national average of 62 per cent;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) that Tasmania exports significant volumes of onions and cherries, for example:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in the 12 months to June 2013, it exported $44 million of fresh fruit and vegetables, 6.7 per cent of the total value of national exports of fresh fruit and vegetables, and of this, 98 per cent of the fruit were cherries and 94 per cent of the vegetables were onions,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Tasmania accounted for 52 per cent of all cherries and 86 per cent of all onions exported from Australia in 2012-13; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) in 2012 the Australian exports of fresh onions and fresh cherries accounted for 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively, of global exports of these products;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) that an independent assessment of the economic development potential of sectors of the Tasmanian economy found that the wine, dairy and aquaculture sectors had the greatest economic development potential;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) that horticulture also presents opportunities for growth in employment, though not as great as those in the wine, dairy and aquaculture sectors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) that the challenges and opportunities faced by Tasmania's fruit and vegetable industry have been well documented and the industry has been subject to many reviews and planning processes; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (j) that, to assist the deliberations of the Taskforce, the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, as the secretariat to the Taskforce, has identified and summarised a collection of previous work and in so doing, is mindful that individual Taskforce members would be familiar with a number of these documents, in some cases contributing directly to their production; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes the continuing importance of investment in the Tasmanian agriculture sector, as a traditional and ongoing source of economic development, including employment, in that state, and one which continues to enjoy a relatively high national and international profile for the reliability and quality of its primary food production.
