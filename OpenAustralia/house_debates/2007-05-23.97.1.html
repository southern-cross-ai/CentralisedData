       <p>
        Recently I had the great pleasure to visit Palmerston
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School" rel="nofollow">
         High School
        </a>
        in my electorate to meet with teachers and students. The school had received funding to upgrade their computer technology and home economics facilities under the Investing in Our Schools Program. It was very necessary equipment and infrastructure. By focusing on delivering small-scale projects that have been identified as a priority by school communities, the Howard government is providing local schools like Palmerston High with a voice to determine what they think is important for their schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        What impressed me the most was how committed the school is to ensuring our future generation is well prepared for the transition from school to the workforce.

        is a model for all schools nationwide with its middle school, senior school and special education structure. It recognises that the middle years, ages 11 to 15, are formative years in which a wide range of experiences need to be provided to assist with gaining knowledge and understanding of the real world. This foundation of learning becomes a tool for future success as adults.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Julianne Willis, the school principal, and assistant principals

        on their commitment to providing an excellent and relevant educational experience for the 750 students in years 7 to 12 at Palmerston High which will help them to make a valuable contribution to our society in the future. A good example is the programs being implemented at the special education centre which help to optimise children’s learning experiences. Students come to Palmerston High School’s special education centre from 11 feeder schools. The centre has students who attend rotational work experience one day a week at Target, Woolworths, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Country Music Shack, the Handicapped Persons’ Association, Crocodylus Park, Overflow and a local nursery. Sarah Stocks, a senior teacher in the centre, has been a prime mover in developing its three levels of work experience. Palmerston High offers school based work experience which is fully supported by a work trainer from the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also work experience available through a program called Transition Education Student Services, which enables students to attend a work site with a work trainer and work alongside a co-worker. Finally, there is so-called level 2 work experience which enables a student to work independently at a work site, which may in turn offer an employment opportunity in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre also enables special education students the opportunity to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Darwin University
        </a>
        at Palmerston to study for their certificate I in Retail. Students who require high-support care and are unable to complete work experience prepare for life beyond school through a program called Post School Options, which is run by Anglicare. This program incorporates community access with recreation and leisure activities at a facility in Wulagi, with scheduled activities organised one day per week in Palmerston, about 20 kilometres from Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the broader school stream, vocational education training is also one of the school’s strengths. Much credit must go to Yvonne McDonnell, senior studies coordinator at Palmerston High School, for the design and implementation of a number of vocational training courses known as the Vocational Pathways program. They offer a combination of work and study options leading to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Certificate_of_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory Certificate of Education
        </a>
        and/or a school based apprenticeship. Work Ready Pathway offers an intensive six-week course which helps students gain full-time employment. This program is delivered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_College" rel="nofollow">
         International College
        </a>
        of Advanced Education—Myriad Group Training. Palmerston High has also gained support and participation for their

        and Palmerston Regional Business Association.
       </p>
       <p>
        Palmerston High School is an excellent example of how governments, schools, school communities, registered training organisations and local businesses can successfully work together to achieve positive education outcomes. I congratulate staff and students on their fine work. They do a fantastic job in building the lives of young people and setting them on the path to positive careers. They deserve our respect and applause.
