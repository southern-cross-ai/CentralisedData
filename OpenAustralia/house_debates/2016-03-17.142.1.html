        One issue that has been raised with me on a number of occasions within my electorate is the situation that exists in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">
         West Papua
        </a>
        . I have been contacted, and I have read widely, and I have learnt that there are some disturbing facts around human rights abuses that are happening in West Papua. As a member of the parliamentarians group for West Papua, I have heard of some of the atrocities that have happened in that country. I think it is time that we as a nation actually looked at what is happening there and asked some serious questions.

        It was brought to my mind again by Tre Clifford when he came to visit me in my office towards the end of last year. He queried the Australian support for what was happening in West Papua. He was particularly concerned, as am I, about the restriction of democracy and human rights happening in West Papua, such that we can no longer turn a blind eye. He also pointed out to me the role that Australia plays in training, arming and engaging with Special Detachment 88, or D88, as it is known, and some of the atrocities that have been associated with that unit. I highlight a number of human rights abuses allegedly committed by D88: the torture and maltreatment of 15 people, including seven- and eight-year-old girls arrested in Nafri in August 2011; the killing of six unarmed independent activists in October 2011; the killing of Mako Tabuni in June 2012; the killing of Hubertus Mabel in December 2012; the torturing and killing of Papuan priests; and razing 13 houses in and around Pogo in December 2012.
       </p>

        The Pacific Islands Forum recently convened, in September, and highlighted the need for nations to address the issues in West Papua. It is something that is right on our doorstep. We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to it. There have been many stories and exposes of what is happening there. As a nation that values human rights, I think that we should call for human rights to be recognised within West Papua.
