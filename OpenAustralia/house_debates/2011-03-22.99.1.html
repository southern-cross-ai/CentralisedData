       <p>
        Recently, I attended the launch of a new foundation in Queensland, and while that does not seem to warrant in itself an address in this House, being the nation’s parliament, this night was particularly worthy of mention. It was a night of informative overtones along with the opportunity to share insight into the lives of a particular family, who, in the face of adversity, are showing incredible courage and leadership in raising awareness of what at the outset is a terrible and debilitating disease. Initially when I was asked to attend the function and told what it was in aid of, I had no idea what the disease was and had to ask, like many Australians, ‘What is motor neuron disease?’
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation that was launched in Brisbane was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MND" rel="nofollow">
         MND
        </a>
        and Me Foundation. During the night I had the absolute honour of meeting for the first time a very special and loved-by-all bloke by the name of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Sullivan
        </a>
        , who, in his opening remarks, said, ‘Pessimists are people who find difficulty in opportunity and optimists are people who find opportunity in difficulty’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott Sullivan, recently diagnosed with motor neurone disease, has set about raising the awareness of this debilitating and, at this stage, incurable disease, which strikes indiscriminately at those who are in the prime of their lives. His positive actions have resulted in him creating the newly formed MND and Me Foundation, of which he is one of the inaugural founding directors, along with Luke Gifford, Luke Jeffrey and Shane Williamson. I wish each of them every success in their newly distinguished and vitally important roles within this foundation. The foundation will work in conjunction with both the Queensland and Australian MND organisations. The event was patronised by 655 people at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncorp_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Suncorp Stadium
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to share with you a story about the Sullivan family. Scott is 38 and was a fit, athletic father of two when he was diagnosed with MND in late October last year. After a battery of tests, his neurologist told him: ‘I believe you have motor neuron disease. There is no cure and your life expectancy is three to five years.’ Scott is surrounded by some wonderful support and family. Motor neurone disease affects about 1,400 Australians, about 300 of whom are from Queensland. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is 27 months. So Scott and his family have some challenges in front of them. Scott, your strength, your commitment to life and the support of your family that I witnessed was overwhelming. Your approach of ‘the glass is always half full’ is inspiring. Mate, from me to you, nothing but love and joy.
