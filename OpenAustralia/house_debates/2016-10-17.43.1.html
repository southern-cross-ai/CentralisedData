        I want to take this opportunity to read onto the record some of the stories I have been told regarding

        . My community's hospital has the longest emergency department waiting times in the state and the longest elective surgery waiting times, and both are getting worse. Too often I think these facts and figures are lost on policy and decision makers. The reality is that every failure of the health system has real and lasting effects on real people. These taxpayers deserve a properly funded health system but instead, in the case of the

        community that I represent, they are provided with a hospital that has too few beds, too few doctors and too few nurses to serve the 350,000-plus people that it is there to serve.

        Hospital every month for her disabled husband to take tests on his spine. If there was a bed available in Nepean, he could attend there. They are still doing the two-hour trip every day from Nepean to the North Shore. This is frustrating and I call on the government to change it immediately.
