        On 6 April Paul Dearing—a three-time Olympian, a member of the Hockey Australia Hall of Fame and an icon of Newcastle sport—died. He was also a constituent who lived in Eleebana. He was a fearless shot stopper and he played in 69 tests between 1963 and 1972. He appeared at the Tokyo 1964,

        . He was a highly respected coach and umpire.

        He died at his family home in Eleebana after a long battle with an illness. He was 73. He was a pioneer in an era where goalkeepers were admired for their courage as much as their prowess. He grew up in Carrington at a time when Carrington was not a fashionable suburb. He played for Norths, and he went on to be the best in the world. Dearing was a member of the first Australian hockey team to win an Olympic medal, taking bronze at the Tokyo games. Four years later, they were runners-up in a 1-0 loss to Pakistan in the final. He was also inducted into Hockey Australia's Hall of Fame in 2008. He was named a goalkeeper in the

        as well. He has been an outstanding sportsperson, and my sympathy goes to his family.
