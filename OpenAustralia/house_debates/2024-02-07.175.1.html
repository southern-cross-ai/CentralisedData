        On 26 January many residents of my electorate of Hume were recognised with local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        awards for outstanding contributions to their communities. I'm delighted to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Dr Brett Summerell from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Douglas Park
        </a>
        , who was appointed as a

         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in the General Division of the Order of Australia. Dr Summerell has made a significant mark on the community through his service to the environment, particularly in the fields of plant pathology and mycology. He has been recognised for his vital research into plant diseases caused by fungi and into the prevention and treatment of these diseases. He has spent an extraordinary career researching plant science and leading a team of world-class plant scientists. He has helped establish vital scientific facilities such as PlantClinic, the Australian PlantBank and the National Herbarium of

       <p>
        I would also like to recognise fellow recipients of the medal of the Member of the Order of Australia. Jenny Lambert from Werombi, who's known by many in this place, was recognised for her service to business. Jenny has spent the last four decades working in industrial relations and found herself to be chief executive officer of four different employer industry organisations throughout her career. Finally, Dr Stuart Quarmby, a great friend, an incredible Australian and a great constituent of mine, was honoured for his contribution to primary and secondary education over a 38-year career, with 17 of those years in the role of foundation headmaster of

        at Tahmoor. He took that school from not existing to being a major force for education in my electorate, and he did an outstanding job in doing all of that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dedication of these three recipients has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the lives of many. My heartfelt congratulations also extend to Superintendent Michael Rochester from Camden, who was awarded the

         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        , and Acting Assistant Commissioner Brian White from Wayo, who was honoured with the Ambulance Service Medal. Their commitment to public safety and wellbeing is truly admirable and we are grateful for their service. I want to highlight

        recipient Lisa Freeman from

        . Her outstanding public service to the New South Wales District Court, particularly during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, is absolutely commendable. Lisa's dedication to serving our community is a terrific example of the resilience and strength that defines us as Australians.

        I'm immensely proud to celebrate the outstanding achievements of these individuals from my electorate who were recognised with awards this year. Their contributions showcase the diverse and remarkable talents within the community I live in and are symbolic of the sorts of people we have right across this great nation.
