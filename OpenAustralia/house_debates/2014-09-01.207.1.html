       <p>
        I rise today to recognise the work done by the Hallett Cove Meals on Wheels branch who recently celebrated their 22nd year of delivering meals to those in our community who cannot easily shop or cook for themselves. The Hallett Cove Meals on Wheels provide their clients with affordable, nutritious meals but also, very importantly, that friendly social contact for those in the community who may feel otherwise isolated. The friendly volunteers support their clients so that they can continue to live independently at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 22nd year for Hallett Cove Meals on Wheels has been a busy year with steady growth in both clients and volunteers. The branch currently delivers between 230 and 250 meals per week to clients in the community. They have impressively achieved over 210,000 meals since the branch was established.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to all those volunteers including Doreen Hodgeman who received a reward for 15 years of service and Kaye August who received the Premiers Award for her ongoing and dedicated service to the branch. There were many others who received awards. Indeed, there were five volunteers who received their 10-year service award, three volunteers who received their five-year service award and nine volunteers who received their one-year service award. I would like to thank all the members, the new and returning members, of the committee. I cannot go through all their names but these volunteers really ensure that those in our community who are most vulnerable do get the support they need. These volunteers are very selfless and I congratulate them all.
