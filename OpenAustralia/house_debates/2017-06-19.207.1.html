        It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak about the fantastic work that our chaplains do in our local schools. On a day when debate is raging about what is best for our schooling systems, I would like to take a step back for a moment to give my thanks and appreciation to some of the unsung heroes in our nation's schools, our chaplains. Last month, I attended a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripture_Union" rel="nofollow">

        chaplain's dinner at the Beenleigh Events Centre to show my unwavering support for this important and valuable undertaking in our school communities.

        It is an unfortunate fact of life that many of our nation's youngest are doing it tough. Many school students, even primary school students, in this country are under enormous pressure academically, socially and sometimes within the confines of their own family homes. Our schooling system has changed dramatically over the last couple of decades but, thankfully, our school chaplains are there to answer children's pleas. These selfless individuals provide the listening ear so many children need and work tirelessly to make sure that each and every child feels valued, accepted and confident.
       </p>

        The principle of Mount Warren Park State School, Mr Clay McCann, said it well when he addressed us at the chaplain's dinner last month. He said the aim in any school is to have a school that allows learning to take place in a safe and supportive learning environment. How do you measure emotional support? This is the field that chappies work in and succeed in every day.
