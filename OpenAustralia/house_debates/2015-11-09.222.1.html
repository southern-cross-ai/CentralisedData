        Mental illness is prevalent in all aspects of society and no longer is it the shameful family secret to be locked away in the institutions of the past centuries. Mental illness does not discriminate. It can and does affect and impact all of us. Mental illness is a serious medical issue. It cannot be overcome through just willpower and it is not related to a person's character or intelligence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of mental illness within the Australian population is becoming increasingly apparent with 45 per cent of Australians aged 16 to 85 having experienced a mental disorder at some point of their life. This equates to 7.3 million Australians. One in five Australians aged 16 to 85 experiences a mental illness in a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is encouraging to know that the issue of mental health is being taken with the seriousness it requires. Recently, a mental health conference was held in my electorate of Dobell which coincided with World
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Day on 10 October. I was honoured to be requested by the organisers to open this conference, an honour that I humbly accepted. Hosting a gathering of outstanding professionals in their fields, a broad range of mental health specialities, is an achievement for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , and I was proud to be part of this event as the only local member of parliament in the region to officially open the summit addressing a major national health issue. It demonstrates not only the role that government can play in accepting and beating mental health challenges but also the role of the Central Coast community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the topics raised at the summit was the increasing number of returned servicemen and servicewomen who are experiencing mental health issues upon their return from active serviceâ€”in particular post-traumatic stress disorder. It was identified that there is an increased need for mental health services to specifically cater for our returned servicemen and servicewomen, as the types of mental health issues they experience can be unique and must be catered for appropriately. It was a privilege to be able to attend the summit, and I again thank Sue Rigney and her team from Healthe Care for organising and hosting the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the Central Coast 4.5 per cent of hospital admissions in 2011-12 were of a mental health nature, and statistics highlight the growing need for accessible mental health services for our community. Mental illness usually strikes individuals in the prime of their lives, often during adolescence and young adulthood. All ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Alarmingly, it is estimated that 65 per cent of people with mental illness do not access any treatment and that 72 per cent of males do not seek help for mental disorders.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the Central Coast we are lucky to have the provision of quality support organisations, though I appreciate the need for more services and increased resources and funding. Quality support services in the community keep people well for longer and more connected with their family, friends and community, with a better quality of life, at less cost than psychiatric hospital beds. As our understanding of the impact of mental illness grows, it is important that we look at new ways to provide services and assistance to our community. Daily I am made aware of the impact of mental health issues, particularly on the Central Coast. When I hear stories of eight-year-olds presenting at school, self-harming and saying they are depressed, it shows we have a serious problem on our hands. Our statistics are frightening, and the pressure being placed upon existing services is reaching breaking point. And, while there are numerous reasons for the growing demand for assistance and support, the prevalence of substance abuse on the Central Coast is a stark reminder of the need to act. The rise of 112 per cent in the usage of methamphetamine and ice over the previous two years is indicative of the crisis we are facing on the Central Coast as well as across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May this year I convened the Central Coast Ice Summit to address the serious rise in the use of methamphetamines and their impact on families and the broader community. In raising this issue I note that the final report on tackling ice in our community has been presented to the government, and outcomes and recommendations from this report are expected to commence implementation shortly. A multipronged approach to combat usage of this dangerous drug is no doubt required, and I am ready and willing to support education, increased access to health services for addicts and the enforcement of the law against those associated with this fatal substance. Addressing the use and availability of ice can certainly help limit one significant cause of mental illness, and I am hugely supportive of curbing the impact of ice in our community to see a reduction in psychotic incidents occurring at our emergency departments.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the Central Coast we are known for our beaches, lakes, valleys and sporting achievements to name just a few, but sadly there is a darker side for which unfortunately we are nationally known. This includes high rates of domestic violence and, up until recent years, one of the highest rates of youth suicide. In discussing mental health in our community it would be remiss of me not to mention the topic of suicide. The most recent data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        indicate that 172 Central Coast families have been directly impacted by suicide in suburbs across my electorate in recent years. A Senate committee inquiry that was held in 2010 estimated that the number of people immediately affected by one suicide is six. However, I maintain that there is no possible way to determine how many people are truly affected by something of this nature. I mention this sobering figure to reflect on how deeply mental health issues affect our community. In acknowledging the far-reaching impact of suicide, it is easy to see how a community based approach to addressing this issue can be successful. I am fortunate to represent an electorate with a number of organisations who share my interest in reducing mental illness and its effects on our community.

        The work of the Gosford North Rotary Club, through their Save Our Kids' program, is a hugely beneficial and important cause. The volunteers of Gosford North Rotary Club, particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Pearson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sharpe" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Sharpe
        </a>
        , undertake a number of initiatives to reduce youth suicide. Earlier this year, there was media attention regarding the work undertaken by the Gosford North Rotary Club, highlighting a total of $50,000 which was raised by volunteers to fund the Save Our Kids project. I thank the entire Gosford North Rotary Club for their efforts. I am sure the whole community acknowledges the great work they do, particularly in this endeavour. I am also proud to be a financial sponsor of this program, and I thank the other sponsors in my community for their commitment to the Save Our Kids program.

        Many members of this House would be familiar with the work undertaken by Lifeline to reduce the incidence of suicide. I wish to bring awareness to their rollout of training programs, which are a great way to ensure everyone is able to respond to suicide risks should they arise. Lifeline's Accidental Counsellor workshop is one program which equips those who are willing with the ability to step into the role of counsellor momentarily and to respond accordingly to people at immediate risk of suicide, if a professional is unavailable.
       </p>
       <p>
        When consulting with the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee, I raised the issue of mental health. For the benefit of those not familiar with this committee, the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee is a group that I established. It consists of students from local schools who provide me with direct advice and input into issues affecting young people. In addressing the issue of mental health with this talented group of young people, I was able to coordinate a roundtable workshop on the subject of mental health. I was very fortunate to be joined by representatives from headspace and also the Central Coast Children &amp; Young People's Mental Health. We asked the committee to tell us what they believed were the main causes of stress and anxiety among young people. Naturally, the role of social media and cyberbullying was front and centre. They did say that the best way to address stress and anxiety is through the proven tool of peer mentoring.

        As I mentioned before, the impact of suicide is one felt by entire communities, and this is particularly so for the Central Coast community, given the tight-knit nature of our region. Many members will be familiar with suicide in their own communities; however, every once in a while we are confronted with a case which is reported in the media and we are all prompted to rise to attention. As recently as last week, the story of Rhys McNaughton was in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
          Daily Telegraph
         </a>
        </i>
        , reminding us all about suicide in young people. Known affectionately as 'Zeffa' due to his likeness to actor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Efron" rel="nofollow">
         Zac Efron
        </a>
        , Rhys was a popular young man, a talented sportsperson, aspiring model and heading towards a career in teaching. To the outside, this Central Coast-born young man was the last person to be considered at risk. His friends have now commenced an awareness and fundraising campaign through the Movember website in an attempt to spread the word about their efforts to raise awareness and funds for mental illness. This also includes a plea to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres" rel="nofollow">
         Ellen DeGeneres
        </a>
        and an open letter to Zac Efron to gain support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The silent nature of suicide is the most lethal. Raising awareness to ensure those who battle inner demons are comfortable to discuss the issues they face has to be a priority if we are to reduce the rate of youth suicide. In addressing this, I take my role as the local member as a very important one in working on how we can reduce the impact of mental illness within our community.
