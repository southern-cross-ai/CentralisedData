       <p>
        I rise today to address two issues in relation to the development of the wonderful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Island
        </a>
        within my electorate of Flinders. The first is in relation to the proposal for a Phillip Island aquatic centre. I have supported this proposal since it was first brought to my attention, and I want to say two things about it. The first is that I believe that it is an outstanding item for the future of Phillip Island. The aquatic centre, which would be on land adjacent to and part of the Phillip Island Adventure Resort, is a proposal put forward by the community, developed by the community—by wonderful people such as Pam Cameron and Colin Grey—and it will have a real impact not just for residents but also for tourism on the island. It is part of the process of making the island a year-round destination. Whether it is for families, for young people, with sporting programs, or for elderly people who need the hydrotherapy and aquatic elements of the project, I think it is an outstanding project.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Ken Smith, the member for Bass in the Victorian parliament, we are working very hard to secure a proposal from the community and the council which we can then put to the federal government for Regional Partnerships program funding. There are no guarantees, but I am extremely hopeful. I am extremely keen to receive the application and we will fight like caged tigers to try to get a result on that. It is something to which I have a deep personal commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the counter side, however, is the recent state decision to declare working land on Phillip Island as farm zone which can no longer be developed, which I think is deeply counterproductive. There are different activities: A Maze’N Things and its wonderful tourism activities; the Adventure Resort—which is helping out with the aquatic centre; Newhaven Christian College, which is a wonderful school; and the Rhyll Fishing Park. These are all functioning activities. Their land is in reality a rural activity zone, yet it has been declared a farm zone, which means that they are frozen in time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an unacceptable and arbitrary declaration over their land. At the same time, the Victorian Minister for Planning has declared farmland to be a rural activity zone elsewhere. That clearly is because there are deep links with big city money. I make no apologies for making that claim. I think it is unacceptable. What they have done is rezone farmland for rural activity and made small businesses and a school pay the price for whatever sweetheart deals they have done. It is unacceptable and these businesses must be given a go.
