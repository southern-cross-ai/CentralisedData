        This one is hard for me, so I am going to use the words of other people. I have here a photo of Bishop John Charles McIntyre with the people of Redfern behind him for his Order of Service on his passing. 'Bishop whose heart 'lay with the alien and the outsider'' was the headline in the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under attack in 2012 for appointing a gay priest in a same-sex partnership to a Gippsland parish, he told his diocese's synod that he believed that "God has been and is at work in and through gay and lesbian people". Despite strident condemnation from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Diocese of Sydney
        </a>
        and other conservative church commentators, he refused to back down. While other Anglican Church leaders privately support gay clergy, few are prepared to stand up for their beliefs in the face of attacks from those determined to uphold the traditionalist viewpoint.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although this controversy shone the spotlight on Bishop McIntyre, those who had experienced his ministry as a parish priest and then as bishop over 37 years already knew him as a strong progressive voice for good in many areas. These included not just his acceptance of gay people, but his work with the disadvantaged and marginalised, with Aboriginal people and his support for the full ministry of women in the church.

        another great defender of the marginalised, described Bishop McIntyre "as a man whose heart lay with the alien and the outsider". John and Jan "lived" an acceptance of others, he said, reaching out to alienated people and helping them find community. "They are passionate about the needs of dispossessed people," he said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These priorities did not change in his promotion to the episcopate … The same passion for the dispossessed and the marginalised, and the same strong advocacy on their behalf, marked his all-too-short time in Gippsland.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Just three weeks before he died, Bishop McIntyre—seemingly recovering from his illness—delivered what would be his final presidential address to his diocese's annual synod. It is vintage McIntyre—a clarion call to the church to "be present in community with an integrity of being that assures all those whose lives we touch that we are there alone for their wellbeing; that we are constantly and consistently committed to peace with justice, mercy and inclusion".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, his address called on the Australian government and community to offer compassion and justice to asylum seekers, to act responsibly to the threat of climate change and to reject—
       </p>
       <p>
        other more sinister agendas.

        Since his death, heartfelt tributes have flowed across social media from his many friends, and even from some who had condemned his support the gay clergy. The tribute from Pastor Ray Minniecon, the

        "John Mac," he said, "had this incredible ability to blend into the social fabric of our local community without being 'seen' as a priest or a 'do-gooder'. He knew how to feel the pulse, the pain, the suffering as well as the strength and resilience of our local people and community. He became 'one' with the people and their struggles rather than someone who 'had all the answers' and told you what you needed to know and do."

        John Mac, he said, "knew how to put his faith into overalls".
