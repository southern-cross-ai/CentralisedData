        I rise tonight to talk on a bit of a lighter matter, to comment on the vibrant community that is working very actively in Greenway. I would particularly like to highlight two festivals that happened on the weekend. Greenway is very diverse and has a number of communities that have unique characteristics. I would firstly like to talk about the Riverstone Festival, which happens every year. Every year this festival is coordinated by a dedicated band of volunteers, led by Phyllis McAlpine. She is president of the committee and a member of the historical society.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to be part of a street parade that brought together several community organisations, from primary schools—we had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John" rel="nofollow">

        ’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        and Riverstone Primary School—to the Riverstone Razorbacks rugby league team, the scouts, several local businesses, the chamber of commerce and of course many bands. I was heartened to see that, in spite of the clouds appearing, we had several thousand there. They turned out in great waves to celebrate with their fellow community members.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate some of the local volunteer organisations, like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        , who had a sausage sizzle on the day. As a member of the local Riverstone Lions I was able to pitch in and turn a few sausages, and we had great fun. I would also like to congratulate other groups such as the Riverstone Family Connect Project, which works with single mums and helps them prepare for work. They were actively involved in raising funds there. It was a fantastic community day.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the Sunday I had the privilege of attending the first Kellyville Ridge Community Association open day at Merriville House. Merriville House was built in the 1820s and is owned by a wonderful couple, Colin and Marion Malcolm, who are both part of the Kellyville Ridge Community Association and work very actively in the community. Again, over 1,000 people attended. The open day was absolutely outstanding. I participated in the gumboot throwing competition. I did not win the event; however, towards the end of the day I, my husband, some local firies and some gentlemen dressed in regalia of the 1820s participated in the tug of war. I have to say that we won. So there were great community activities. We also had the whip cracking. Next year I may invite the Chief Government Whip to attend. He may just win that event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to commend the work of North West Community Care group. This community organisation works with Landcom and a number of community organisations across the Norwest sector to develop family day care and child care. It also works with mums to develop support groups and have large community events that bring the community together. In a sector like Norwest development there are a number of families who move into the area and who do not know each other. These kinds of events bring people together in a place where they can get to know each other, have fun and play together and where isolation is broken down. Building sustainable communities is really critical in this day and age.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to commend the coordinator of that event, Gillian Schrickker and Warren Weir, who heads up North West Community Care, for pulling this together; and the Kellyville Ridge Community Association. I look forward to this event, which will be running every year. My understanding is that starting next year it will be running in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Week" rel="nofollow">
         Heritage Week
        </a>
        and will be an annual event. So I look forward to that. I congratulate everybody for participating, for their hard work and for creating such a wonderful opportunity for families, individuals and community organisations to come together and celebrate our diversity and enjoy one another’s company.
