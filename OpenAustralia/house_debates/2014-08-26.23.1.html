       <p>
        After five weeks in our communities, we have all heard—loud and clear—of the shock, the anger and the fear that the community feels as a result of this government's budget. In Adelaide, I have heard how residents have been frightened by this budget and how they feel that they have been betrayed by this Prime Minister. I want to share some of their own words on what my community has said about this budget.

        Sarah stated that this budget is 'an attack on the Australian way of life'. Melissa, who is a cancer survivor, raised her concerns about the

        co-payment with me. She is worried about the impact it would have not just on our health system but also on the health of individuals if they did not access the health care that they need. Jane raised the fact that she believes 'a quality, affordable education should be the right of every Australian child'. And Costello stated to me that he was concerned about the opportunities of future generations. This government is not fooling anyone with its cruel and tricky budget. We have all heard it in our communities; they have all heard it in theirs. The difference is that we stand up and represent our communities, put those concerns on the record in this parliament and vote in the way that is going to protect the fairness that the Australian public rely upon. Those over there, who come in here and blindly follow the Prime Minister but duck and weave in their own communities, will not stand up for what they actually believe in.
