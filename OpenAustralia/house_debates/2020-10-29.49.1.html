        Longman is home to some fantastic sporting clubs that have been around for many years, but there is no escaping the fact that, as time goes on, the facilities these clubs have relied on for many years are beginning to age, just like some of their athletes. The Caboolture touch and rugby union clubs currently occupy a clubhouse that is over 30 years old. It has issues with accessibility such that, under new building standards, the building would not be approved. They need to be addressed. Facilities at the Petersen Road Sports Ground cater to around 1,680 players between the two clubs. The clubs also run clinics for kids during the day during school holidays, so it's fair to say these facilities get some use. In fact, they see more than 5,000 people a week in peak times, including players, their families, other spectators and officials.

        The clubs, under the umbrella of Caboolture Sports Club, have been working for some time to secure funding for a redevelopment of the facility. They have plans for a $4 million overhaul of the entire Petersen Road sports precinct. This includes opening it up to more non-sporting groups to use for meetings and other activities.

        have already pledged partial funding for this project. I too support this redevelopment and look forward to working hard in Canberra to put forward a case to secure the federal funding needed to get this jointly funded project started.
