        recently travelled to Taiwan to compete in the Taiwan Open World Longboard Championships. Harley Ingleby, Jared Neal and Jack Entwistle all travelled to Jinzun Harbour in Taiwan to compete in the championship, which was the last longboard event for 2017. Jared and Jack ended up drawing each other in round 2, and Harley was able to make it through to the semifinal, eventually being defeated by the event champion. With the championships now behind them, Jack and Jared share 22nd place on the world rankings, with Harley finishing the year in fifth place. I congratulate all three for competing on the world stage and wish them every success next year.

        I'd like to congratulate the Clunes Auto Centre, which recently celebrated its 70th birthday. It has been operated by the one family. The business was originally owned by Col and Val Johnston and is now owned and operated their son Garry and his wife, Trish. For many years, the Johnston family has provided motoring and mechanical services to the surrounding areas of Clunes. Garry, at 21, began his apprenticeship as a partner in the family business and expanded it to become a used car dealership. They are very much into vintage cars and have done a lot of work in that area, and they have been great community representatives. My in-laws have lived in Clunes for almost that whole time, and they have always respected the Johnston family. I wish them well.
