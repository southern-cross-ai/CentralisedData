        This week is National Volunteer Week, and I thought it fitting that in today's debate I acknowledge the tremendous job that so many volunteers do in my southern

        s, chambers of commerce and other social and support networks. Each year I host the McPherson Community Achiever Awards as a way for our local community to say thank you to those special people who are always willing to lend a hand. Award recipients are nominated by grateful community members, and it is truly inspiring to see the glowing references that are provided each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week it was my privilege to conduct the 2017 McPherson Community Achiever Awards. I would like to read into
        <i>

        the names of the recipients of the various award categories.
       </p>
       <p>
        McPherson Community Achiever Award recipients were Liz Bailey, Ronnie Broadbent,

        and the members of the Elanora State High School Leo Club. I would particularly like to acknowledge those who were able to be there at the awards ceremony: Kiara Bird, Amy Fletcher, Erin Logan, Faith Reid, Cain Leech and Anthea Young.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recipients of the McPherson Surf Lifesaving Community Achiever Awards were Chris Bindley, Nicole Bowers, Scott Burgess, Scott Byrnes, Pat Gillett, Colleen Gordon, Phill Hammond, John Hamrey, Gavin Jordon, Belinda McAuliffe, Erica Read, Michelle Slattery,

        and Vaughn Thomas.

        I thank all of these local volunteers again for their time and dedication. I would also like to congratulate the 17 volunteer organisations on the southern Gold Coast that I recently announced would share in more than $69,000 in Volunteer Grants funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, it has always struck me as a little unfair that National Volunteer Week usually falls during the budget week, when the media is focused on the federal budget. But there is no hiding the fact that volunteering is very much at the centre of our national character. Around 5.8 million Australians—31 per cent of the population—regularly volunteer their time, and in so doing they make an estimated annual contribution of $290 billion to our economic and social good.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to all our volunteers.
