        The amendments which we present today to the House are very important amendments. In essence, they will prohibit online gambling companies from being able to offer lines of credit to their customers. This was an election commitment of ours in 2013; it was raised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Farrell" rel="nofollow">
         O'Farrell
        </a>
        review into online gambling; it was an election commitment of ours in 2016; and now the amendments to this bill will implement those commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        In essence, we are concerned about online gambling companies offering lines of credit, because there is too much of a conflict between a gambling company providing gambling services on the one hand and effectively being a bank on the other, to enable a gambler to continue with their gambling practice even if they have already cleaned out their savings account and any other asset that they have. We hold the principle very dear that there should be a separation between those two things.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has been a very personal commitment of mine as well since my first term in this parliament—from perhaps five years ago now. It was brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who came to see me with his widowed mother. He was a person who had a gambling problem and was unemployed at the time. He did not have a job and he would have struggled to get a second-hand car loan, but he was offered, first of all, $5,000 by Sportsbet to continue his betting by way of a line of credit and then $10,000, then $20,000, then $40,000 and then $80,000 in credit by this online gambling company for him to continue his betting practices despite him being an unemployed individual. He came to see me after the gambling company said to him, after he had blown all of that money, that he had to pay back the money and that they were going to bankrupt him and seize his and his widowed mother's house to pay back the debt. I committed at that time that we should fix this problem, and today this bill does exactly that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, though, the bill does provide an exemption, and that is the exemption for trackside bookmakers—in essence, those trackside bookmakers who have been doing their practice for hundreds of years. Indeed, my understanding is that that is where credit betting initially originated—from giving a nod to a potential customer trackside. We had always said that we would exclude that category, and this important amendment does exclude that category of people from the application of the otherwise broad principle of prohibiting gambling companies offering lines of credit. The bill also allows a transition period of six months before the prohibition comes into effect, to allow waging operators and consumers to adjust their business and betting practices, with no time limits placed on the recovery of debts as such. But the amendment also gives authority for the

        to undertake a statutory review after three years to assess the effectiveness of these new provisions. It also prohibits operators from promoting or facilitating credit via a third party—for example, small account credit contractors such as payday lenders—which was not captured in the initial Senate amendments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the member for Franklin, who is sitting opposite me, for her cooperation in working through these amendments. These amendments, in essence, are in place of amendments which were moved by the Xenophon Team in the Senate and which the Labor Party supported. We were concerned that those amendments had not been thought through and had not made that carve out provision for the trackside bookmakers. There were also a few other technical problems with those amendments. In consultation with the member for Franklin, as well as with the broader industry, the responsible gambling groups such as Responsible Wagering Australia, we are confident that this bill, these amendments, will fulfil the overall objective of prohibiting lines of credit being offered. That will help many thousands of people in the years ahead, as well as provide that essential carve out for the trackside bookmakers, so that they continue their practice. I commend these amendments to the House.

         Labor has always maintained a strong stance to ensure appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place to protect and assist our community when it comes to responsible gambling. We know that the majority of people who gamble enjoy it and do it in a responsible manner. However, we also acknowledge that gambling in our community can, in some cases, have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences. That is why we supported many elements of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016, moved by the minister in this place. The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 is an important starting point that will go towards improving protections for those who choose to wager within an online environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor has been very clear on our position when it comes to banning credit betting. We have always thought a ban on credit betting is an important part of harm minimisation measures, particularly in relation to problem gambling. And that is why we did support a Senate amendment to ban credit betting. While I appreciate and acknowledge the minister's personal commitment, it is a shame that this provision was not in the original bill. I am not sure why it was not in the original bill, and I understand that the minister wanted to deal with the states on these matter first and come to that. But it really could have been in the original bill, and we could have had this bill through the houses of parliament months earlier. But it is very pleasing to see that the government and the minister have worked very hard to ensure that this amendment occurs and that the ban on credit betting provision will be in the bill. I also understand and appreciate the government's consultation in relation to the trackside bookmakers and the exemptions that will be provided in this bill for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to that exemption, I have also sought some assurances from the government and the minister that the turnover of $30 million is an appropriate threshold to have this exemption for trackside bookmakers. I want to put on record that, if there is any way that any of the other gaming operators try to get through this loophole, I would expect the government to act on that. It is of course only intended for trackside bookies that this occurs. I appreciate the government working on that and I appreciate the consultation from the government on it, and I am really pleased to see that finally we will get some harm minimisation for people in an online gambling environment. I will be supporting the government's amendment.
