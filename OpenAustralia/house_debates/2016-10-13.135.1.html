        I rise to speak about a meeting I had on 7 October with Wendy Francis from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Christian_Lobby" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Christian Lobby
        </a>
        . This was not a meeting about the marriage equality plebiscite or anything like that. This was actually about something that Wendy and I agree on. We agree about billboards being G-rated; but this was another topic. I met with Wendy Francis, Ian, Lauren and Ann to discuss an application by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_Ridge" rel="nofollow">
         Acacia Ridge
        </a>
        Hotel to turn that area into an adult entertainment area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not sure if you know the southern suburbs of Brisbane. This is a working-class suburb surrounded by an industrial area. It is the end of the standard gauge rail line and is a big shipping container distribution area. It is a good, strong working-class suburb. The Acacia Ridge Hotel is a fine hotel. I have been there, I have had functions there and I have had a few drinks in the bar there over many years. My grandad used to drink there. Its attempt to change this area is an attack on the community. I will back Ian, Lauren and Ann as much as I can to make sure this does not happen. I know there is an entertainment precinct in the middle of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         The Valley
        </a>
        in the city. That is fine. I understand that. But putting an entertainment precinct here would completely change the character of this area and have an impact on families.
       </p>
       <p>
        We took our concerns to Acting Senior Sergeant Murray Crone, the officer in command at the Acacia Ridge police station, and he listened to us. There is still a process going on where the state government has a say when it comes to the entertainment licence. We have already had the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        sign off in terms of the planning, saying it could take place. I am disappointed that took place. I know that Councillor Steve Griffiths spoke up and said it did not suit the area and that it would be a complete departure from what goes on in the suburbs of Brisbane. It would be like moving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Kings Cross
        </a>
        , or a similar entertainment area, to the suburbs of Sydney. I would hope that there would never be a need for such entertainment; but I understand it does take place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am giving my word to Wendy Francis and to the other residents of Moreton that I will do what I can to make sure that the voices of the good families and people who go about their business. We have day care centres. We have a Police-Citizens Youth Club across the road. This is a family area. Admittedly, it is also an industrial area, but the residents of Acacia Ridge and my familyâ€”my grandad has been there since World War

        , since he worked with the Yanks when it was an airport as part of the defence of Australia. We will do what we can to make sure Acacia Ridge stays safe.
