        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SJ" rel="nofollow">

        . Sadly, Father Tony passed away at the age of 70 a little over a week ago. Although he was born in Perth in 1947, Father Tony will be remembered by most as the headmaster of

        . He served the school for 17 years, from 1986 until 2003, and was a role model and guide for thousands of young people who passed through the gates of this great school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Tony joined the

        and Victoria. He first came to Sydney in 1973, spending a year at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Ignatius" rel="nofollow">

        ', Riverview, and returned there again in 1979. Nineteen eighty-five saw Father Tony move to St Aloysius' for the first time, becoming its 20th headmaster the following year. He was to become the school's longest-serving headmaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Tony played a huge role in the lives of the students of St Aloysius' over that period. He was described by one friend as coming to the school with a construction hat, and the list of building works undertaken during his leadership confirms this. Among those projects was the installation in the school chapel of the stained-glass windows by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Moore" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Moore
        </a>
        and the Letourneau organ. These provide something of a key to Father Tony's character. As a good Jesuit, he did everything to the greater glory of God, and these projects in the chapel show that spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        But also, as a good Jesuit, a good priest and a good man, for him this greater glory of God came out most in the pastoral care shown to others. It is here that Father Tony left his strongest legacy, in the lives and in the hearts of his students. Wherever two or three old Aloysians are gathered, his name will be mentioned and imitations often given. One former Aloysian who worked closely with Father Tony was my predecessor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hockey" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and I know the regard in which Joe held Father Tony. I'm sure he would want me to associate him with these remarks today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Tony was not just there for the students in the chapel or the classroom; he was there for them throughout their lives, to celebrate in the good times, at weddings and baptisms, and to support and to console in the hard times, not only at funerals but at any time of need. The example of pastoral care and support was shown again during his appointment to Sacred Heart Residence, North Sydney, after retiring as headmaster of St Aloysius'. There he started Father Tony's lunch, a free Christmas lunch catering for up to 200 people who had nowhere else to go on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Tony passed away on February the 18th, having given his life to the community of North Sydney. He lived 'ad majorem Dei gloriam', and the evidence is shown in the memories cherished by students, colleagues, confreres and every one of the thousands he helped. Vale, Father Tony.
