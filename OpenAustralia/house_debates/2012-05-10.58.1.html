        My question is to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister intervene in the impasse that is destroying the economies of Cardwell,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Mission Beach
        </a>
        and most of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Paradise Coast
        </a>
        . Seventeen months after Yasi there is still no reconstruction of the key
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Barrier Reef
        </a>
        water accesses at Mission Beach and Port Hinchinbrook. Since reconstruction is by way of the federal government's generous renewal program and since below the waterline is federal jurisdiction, could the Prime Minister assure the House she will address the logjams? Could she acknowledge the refurbishment of the Mission Beach jetty, dangerously exposed to ocean currents, is tantamount to trash-canning $3 million, whilst Port Hinchinbrook is being administered under arrangements that make it impossible for it to ever be cleaned up or to stay operational—

         I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I know of his very sincere interest in this matter. He has raised the matter with me before. I know on the times that I have travelled to the region with the member for the Kennedy—and the Deputy Prime Minister has travelled there with him, I believe, on more than one occasion—he has raised these and a series of related questions. I am very happy to say to the member for Kennedy that I am happy to look in detail at the matters that he has raised today.
        </p>
        <p>
         He would be aware, of course, that we have been working with the local community for reconstruction and relief following the cyclone. That has taken many forms. It is part of the overall contribution the Australian government is making to rebuilding essential community infrastructure, and that is in the order of a $5.9 billion contribution. There is a special package of $15 million that the member for Kennedy is aware of to assist with repair of marine infrastructure and restoration of foreshore areas. I know he was involved in the development of that particular package. I know too he has been involved in the recommendations of various work, including looking at some jetties that the member for Kennedy has raised.
        </p>
        <p>
         All in all, I can provide the House with an update: in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North" rel="nofollow">
          Far North
         </a>
         , $443.3 million worth of projects have been completed or are progressing or are out for tender, and a further $243.7 million worth of projects will shortly be released to markets. We understand very sincerely that small businesses and primary producers took a very big hit with the cyclone, so we have been delivering grants and loans, in the number of 2,500, to small businesses and primary producers and also to not-for-profit groups who felt the brunt of the loss of infrastructure and of the community need at this time. On further specifics, I am very happy to keep in discussion with the member for Kennedy about the needs of the community as it recovers from what was a very devastating blow.
