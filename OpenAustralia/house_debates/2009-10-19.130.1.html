       <p>
        On Friday I was at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Greenwood Senior High School
        </a>
        and was handed a petition by the head boy and head girl of the school, Justin Micale and Ellen Collins. The petition was under the name of the principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Harris" rel="nofollow">
         Joanne Harris
        </a>
        , and signed by 170 members of the school community, including staff and students. I understand that the petition came about as a result of a study of poverty and the concerns that the students had about the need for permanent housing facilities for young people at risk of homelessness. I also understand that there are very few housing programs for those under 16.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Greenwood Senior High School petition makes mention of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_House" rel="nofollow">
         Horizon House
        </a>
        in Wanneroo, also known as Bendat House. Jack and Eleanor Bendat donated $100,000 towards the operation of the house, although Jack has committed $2 million in total for the Horizon House concept in

        of God Foundation, which secured a grant from Lotterywest to furnish the home. Providing not only accommodation but also skills training as a Work for the Dole program has resulted in a very big horticultural upgrade to the front section of this immense property.
       </p>
       <p>
        Returning to the petition, I would like to thank Joanne Harris, the principal of Greenwood Senior High School; Liesl Mahood, the chaplain; and the staff and students for their concern in highlighting this issue. Although the petition cannot be accepted by the parliament in its current format, I seek leave to present it as a referenced document and I will also forward a copy to the minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
