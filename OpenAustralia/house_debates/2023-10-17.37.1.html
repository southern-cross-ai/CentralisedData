         Order! There is far too much noise. There was no question there, but because I couldn't hear what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying because of the interjections from the member for

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
                John Howard
               </a>
               promised in 2007 to hold a referendum within 18 months of his election, based upon Indigenous recognition. The Leader of the Opposition has on a number of occasions said that it has been the policy of the Liberal Party since 2007 to have a referendum. If only they had been in a position to do so. They won in 2013, they won in 2016, they won in 2019, and nothing happened. What I did was fulfil the commitment that I gave to Indigenous people but, most importantly, that I gave to the Australian people at the election in which we were elected in May 2022.

               asked for Australians to vote on Indigenous recognition in our Constitution through a voice. They invited us, in the words of the Uluru statement, to walk with them. They said, 'In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we want to be heard,'—that's what they said. We fulfilled that commitment, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have you believe through asking that question that the people who have spent a lifetime campaigning for constitutional recognition of

                 What I have said is I respect the decision that was made by the Australian people. On that basis, some people who have campaigned very strongly for it are not happy with that response. But I made it very clear before the election that I would respect the outcome, and I have made it after as well. I will show respect to those people. The deputy leader shows none.
