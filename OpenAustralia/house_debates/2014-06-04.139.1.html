        Since the 1970s, multiculturalism has had an enormous impact on Australian society. We have seen migration from almost every corner of the globe. This has greatly shaped and influenced our nation, its identity and its values. My electorate of Fowler is very culturally diverse, with people coming from all over the globe. As a matter of fact, it is the most multicultural electorate in the country, with people coming from Serbia, Lebanon, China, Cambodia and Vietnam, amongst many other nations. It is a very vibrant community and I am very proud to represent it. I see firsthand the great and valuable contributions that people from all over the globe bring to our country.

        Unfortunately, the proposed amendments to section 18C of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Racial Discrimination Act
        </a>
        , in my view, would have a significant and adverse impact on the descendants of not only the first people of this country but also the many ethnic groups that have come to call Australia home. One of those groups is the Vietnamese, which is a community that makes up more than 20 per cent of my electorate. The Vietnamese community describes Australia as a 'multicultural, free and democratic nation'. It is these three values which are of great significance to the Vietnamese, who fled as refugees from the communist regime in the mid-seventies. Tania Huynh, a good friend of mine, grew up calling herself an Australian despite her obvious Vietnamese heritage. She was born and raised in Australia, and grew up eating meat pies. loving sport, and singing

        . Her parents came to Australia as refugees from the

        , in search of freedom and liberty. Along with many other ethnic families, they were given the opportunity to build a new life in Australia—a place that they could genuinely call home. Having been elected as a People of Australia Ambassador in 2013, Tania has pledged her commitment to the principles of a multicultural Australia. To Tania, repealing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act will take away substantial gains which many multicultural organisations, and other committed supporters, have worked very hard to achieve over the years.

        The government's proposal does not threaten a specific identity but rather upsets the entire Australian community, bringing into debate their identity and their values. We know intimately the impact of racism on our people: it is hurtful, it is shameful, it undermines our sense of personal security and safety, and it alienates people from the broader community. Tania grew up being able to call herself an Aussie, while being proud of her Asian heritage. Every child deserves the right to be accepted and to feel proud of their cultural background. In saying that, Tania looks forward to an Australia which continues to build on multiculturalism, and which not only accepts but embraces immigrants to our shores. Therefore, the Attorney-General's view that 'people have a right to be bigots' has no place in Australia—
