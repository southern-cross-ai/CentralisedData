        accounts for much of the manufacture of surf craft in Australia. I have spoken about this industry previously in this place, and I now have to inform the House that this industry is struggling. I have spoken at length with representatives of the industry, including Michelle Blauw, a local board manufacturer who has been instrumental in the establishment of a steering committee to set up the Australian Surf-Craft Manufacturing Industry Association.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michelle Blauw advises that the current losses being experienced by the industry fall into three categories. Firstly, the industry is experiencing a downturn in the export market due in part to the high Australian dollar and increased competition from other manufacturers overseas. Secondly, the beginner/intermediate surfing market has been affected by imported boards primarily from China. For example, a board made with a polyurethane base and a fibreglass resin outer and imported from China retails at $350 to $450, while a similar board manufactured and shaped in Australia retails for $650 to $750. The wholesale price of the Australian manufactured board is greater than the retail cost of the imported board. Thirdly, keen surfers who have traditionally bought Australian hand shaped boards and would normally turn them over every six months are now keeping their boards for about two years as they tighten their belts. This is a very significant industry for the Gold Coast, and we cannot afford to lose it. I pledge to support the surf craft manufacturers in any way that I can, and I call on the government to assist.
