       <p>
        On 16 January this year thousands of Queenslanders were returning to their homes and businesses after the recent floods, often to find them completely destroyed. Many tragically lost whatever hope they had held that maybe, just maybe, something had been saved. But whilst these people were grieving, whilst we were comforting our friends and neighbours, and whilst local councils were kicking into gear and fronting up to the mammoth clean-up task ahead, Senator Bob Brown, a political leader in this country, was in the media—safe in Tasmania and far away from the devastation—pushing his own political agenda. Whilst people were, and still are, left uncertain about what their lives now hold, Senator Brown could only concern himself with the political point scoring that the floods offered. That was a despicable action not worthy of him or the position he holds.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe passionately in the importance of full and frank debate concerning the issues confronting our nation. I have a genuine interest and concern as to the ongoing debate regarding our environment. But as important as Senator Brown believes this debate to be, there is a time and a place for things to be said. There is a time and a place for things to be done. To seek to make political capital just as Queenslanders were confronting the devastating results of the floods was insensitive and uncaring because that was a time for things to be done—not for politics. That was a time for our leaders to lead and lend a hand—not for politics. That was a time when so many Australians dropped what they were doing and asked, 'How can I help?'
       </p>
       <p>
        If Senator Brown had joined that magnificent effort and had spoken to as many flood victims as I did, I am sure he would have understood that the people of Emerald, of Toowoomba, of the Lockyer, of Ipswich and of Brisbane needed support at that time and a generous hand of friendship. That is what we saw from so many others of different political persuasions. They did not shout their differences. They stood side by side, not to debate or score points but simply to help. So many of them did their bit—often for complete strangers—but Senator Brown appears only to have seen political opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am concerned about Senator Brown's contribution to this debate because he appears so driven by an absolute conviction of his own infallibility and by an almost manic determination to ride over any alternative view, no matter how reasonable it might be. This driven approach—that rules out debate and paints all those who dare question his extreme views as environmental vandals and deniers—no doubt led Senator Brown to play the politics of the disaster and not deal with the tragic reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Brown knew that the parliament would meet within weeks but he could not wait. Before the leader of the Greens again uses others' adversity for political opportunism, I simply ask that he considers those who have suffered and that not all development is bad. Indeed, with careful consideration and proper environmental safeguards, even dams have their place. When looking at the Brisbane and Ipswich floods, Senator Brown should consider this:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wivenhoe_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Wivenhoe Dam
        </a>
        was built after the 1974 Brisbane floods for flood mitigation and, as such, it was to be complemented by Wolffdene Dam, which was to provide a safe and viable water supply for Brisbane and the south-east corner of Queensland. Although building the Wolffdene Dam would not have changed rainfall patterns, it would have greatly decreased the pressure on Wivenhoe to provide water for a rapidly growing population and it would have planned for Queensland's future. Without that pressure, Wivenhoe could have proved so much more effective in minimising the impact of the recent floods. The Wolffdene Dam was cancelled in 1989 by the Goss Labor administration. Interestingly, Premier Goss' chief of staff at the time was the now member for Griffith. This year we reaped the consequences of that decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        So as Senator Brown drives the Australian government's implementation of his carbon tax, let me say this: Senator Brown's comments are a timely reminder to us all that it is easy to seek out the 10-second media grab, to make a speech and to fight the political fight, but in so doing we should always remember that there are some times that must be above politics. There are some times when we must put aside the bludgeon of politics and stand, even in this place, shoulder to shoulder while doing what we can best do for our nation and for our people in their time of greatest need. The message for Senator Brown is that politics has its time and place, but so too does caring, compassion and plain common sense.
