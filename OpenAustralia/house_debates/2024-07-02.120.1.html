       <p>
        I rise today to speak on the magnificent work being done in my electorate of Dawson. Sixteen-year-old Cadet Sergeant Murray Macgroarty has taken things into his own hands, raising awareness and funds for the ongoing issue of veterans' homelessness. This young citizen committed to walking 382 kilometres around the Mackay Bluewater Quayâ€”a distance equivalent to that between the Mackay Army Reserve barracks and the

        in Townsville. Murray's journey, titled Just Keep Marching, empowers his community to develop a local solution to this national problem. Working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Mackay Sub Branch, he brought his dream to light, completing the final lap yesterday afternoon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just Keep Marching saw the community of Mackay come together to advocate for our veterans. To use Murray's words: 'Our veterans served our country; it's time that our country serves them.' Throughout Murray's research, he has noted that veterans are nearly three times more likely to experience homelessness in Australia, and yet veterans' access to homelessness support is three times less than that for the general population. Concerned, Murray was puzzled about how a developed, first-world country like Australia could possibly let this happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meeting with Murray, it was no surprise that he has a passion for finding a solution to the problem. His dedication and the dedication of those around him who made this event possible reflect how hard work and passion can bring about positive outcomes for our homeless veterans in communities all across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past nine days, Murray has been surrounded by members of the community who have joined him and walked the 16-kilometre lap around Mackay. This sense of community support has made clear to me that, in Mackay, as reflected across the nation, communities believe strongly in a solution to this problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        In taking Murray's fight to Canberra, I congratulate him, his mum, Cynthy, and all those who have helped him on his journey for the incredible work that they have done. I hope this journey is the start of some real action to deliver positive outcomes for our veterans. Good on you, Murray!
       </p>
       <p>
        This statement was written by Rory McPhail from Holy Spirit College Mackay and Nate Ralph from Northern Beaches State High School, who are friends of Murray's and have been doing work experience in my office for the last couple of weeks. Well done, Murray, Rory and Nate. It's always a pleasure to meet tenacious and motivated young men like yourselves, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for all of you fine young men.
