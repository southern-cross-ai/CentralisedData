        My question is also to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister why the government did not require the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to undertake a proper social and economic study as a part of its basin guide. Since a study is now to be undertaken, will the government ensure that the study is comprehensive, including a rigorous analysis of the impact of water cuts on communities and on the prices of food to Australian householders?

         I thank the member for his question. He may want to converse at length with the member for Wentworth about the thinking that went into the legislation and conceptualising the task of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.

           As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport so rightly points out, he could have read his cabinet papers when he was at the cabinet table. That would have been another way of becoming fully informed about the matter. I am not optimistic that that was occurring, but there we have it. The member may choose to talk to the member for Wentworth now. He appears to be searching his great speeches of the past in order to get the edited highlights for the member.

            <p>
             Of course the government is concerned about the social and economic impacts of this reform. This is why we have consistently said—I have said and the minister for water has said—that it is vital that we get the balance right between the environment and food production, the balance right for regional communities. But the member asking me the question knows that no change is not an option, no change is not in the interests of regional communities, no change is not in the interests of Australian farmers. He knows that. He also knows that we are committed to water purchases from willing sellers. He knows that we have already embarked on water purchases which have made a difference already in terms of water entitlements. He knows that that process has been engaged in.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we go through the balance of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority process and of course the process of the parliamentary committee, yes, we want all possible information to be brought to bear on the task so that the judgments that are finally made do get this all-important balance right.
