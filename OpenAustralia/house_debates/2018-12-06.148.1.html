       <p>
        It has been a busy and interesting year. As we approach Christmas, I'd like to reflect on some of the significant moments in my electorate that have made my job as the local member enjoyable and very rewarding—and challenging, I might say.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the incredibly talented local primary school students who took part in my 2018 Christmas card cover competition. The entries were very colourful and impressive. I couldn't decide on one winner, so I chose two winners. I'd like to congratulate Aaron Alescio from the Jacana School for Autism and Sarah El Hassan from Greenvale Primary School, whose creative pieces both made it onto the cover of my 2018 Christmas cards. I want to thank the principals and staff of the primary schools for supporting and encouraging their students in the creative arts. I also want to thank all my local schools, who are terrific in the commitment and dedication they bring to their job as educators of our local students. Our Catholic schools in particular, especially

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Child" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and St Dominic's, have done a tremendous job in assisting with the very large influx of refugees from Iraq and Syria. They go beyond the call of duty to help the children and their families, and I thank them most sincerely for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2018 I also hosted a number of roundtables on important issues that affect my constituents' services and businesses. In July I hosted a settlement round table with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">

        , the shadow minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, and with Nick Tebbey, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Settlement Council of Australia. Providing effective employment services for migrants and refugees is a pressing issue in my electorate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my constituents to ensure that the government is fully aware of these issues. I want to thank the shadow minister for his commitment and his understanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also hosted a trade subcommittee round table on small and medium-sized businesses, which saw the trade subcommittee travel to Calwell and receive submissions from our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
         SME
        </a>
        s in regard to the inquiry around the benefits of free trade agreements and SMEs. The success and provision of opportunities for SMEs locally is very important to our community and local job prospects. I'm very happy to report that our local businesses are very attuned to the desire to expand their own businesses and to also provide job opportunities for our local people.

        This year saw the return of the

        . In the audience that night was Isobel Saxelby. Isobel was six when she arrived in Australia in 1949. As Britain's 100,000th migrant to this country, she was given a toy koala by the then immigration minister, Arthur Calwell. That koala now sits proudly in the

         Museum of Australian Democracy
        </a>
        . Sadly, Isobel passed away quite suddenly last month. I'd like to offer my condolences to her family, especially her husband, Frank. Isobel's story is an important footnote in our country's long and continuing story of migration. As the federal member for Calwell, it was an honour to have met her, and I will remember her fondly, as she and I shared a common journey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge a wonderful woman and diligent member of my staff—a woman who assists my constituents with patience and empathy and a woman I'm so proud to call my friend. Helen Patsikatheodorou has been a long-time member of my staff. This year she lost her husband, John, but she has managed to continue to give to our electorate. Last month, Helen was the 2018 recipient of the prestigious Robert Kumar Community Award for her outstanding contribution to the Hume community. This award, established by Banksia Gardens Community Services in 2015, was named after its inaugural recipient Robert Kumar, the former deputy chief magistrate and regional coordinating magistrate for Broadmeadows, who subsequently presented the award to Helen on that night. Helen has served her community as Hume mayor and as a community leader for decades, making this award very much deserved. Her passion for women's health and her support for older people, services for young people, education and multiculturalism are delivered with care, compassion and understanding. I want to congratulate Helen on finally being recognised for her years of contribution to Hume and the wider Calwell family.
       </p>

        In finishing, I want to thank the outgoing communities in Sydenham and
