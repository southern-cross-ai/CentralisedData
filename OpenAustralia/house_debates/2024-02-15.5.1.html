        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's autonomous sanctions framework is a critical tool of foreign policy which the government uses to demonstrate to the world that we will not tolerate human rights abuses, flouting of the international rules based order, and the undermining of international peace and security.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a challenging global environment, with new and emerging situations of international concern, sanctions are a potent tool to reinforce the values to which Australia ascribes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's sanctions are highly targeted and effective. Through the imposition of travel bans and targeted financial sanctions, we hold actors to account for their egregious behaviour, and prevent illegal activity by imposing costs on those who transact with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's sanctions framework provides the government with the ability to respond quickly and flexibly with our international partners to apply sanctions, exert pressure and effect change across the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since being elected in May 2022, as of 12 February 2024, this government has been decisive in imposing nearly 500 sanctions under the autonomous sanctions framework for a range of matters including flagrant human rights violations, nuclear proliferation, significant cyberattacks and threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have demonstrated our leadership in imposing autonomous sanctions on 190 individuals and 102 entities in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including those linked to Iran's provision of drones to Russia, and human rights abuses against Russian opposition figures.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have sanctioned 40individuals and 20 entities for their involvement in the oppression of women and girls in Iran, and the violent crackdown on protesters since protests began on 16 September 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have sanctioned 29 individuals and 69 entities for their involvement in the nuclear and missile programs of Iran and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         North Korea
        </a>
        , and for their destabilising activities in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also imposed sanctions on 16 individuals and seven entities responsible for the coup d'etat and ongoing repression and violence in Myanmar and for providing funding to the military regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, we have also imposed Australia's first-ever autonomous cyber sanction on an individual for their role in the compromise of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medibank_Private" rel="nofollow">
         Medibank Private
        </a>
        network in 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the face of an increasing need to respond to situations of international concern, it is necessary to ensure that Australia's autonomous sanctions framework is robust and clear. The bill will help us do this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill amends the Autonomous Sanctions Act to remove any possibility of doubt that individuals or entities can be validly sanctioned based on their past conduct or status. Imposing sanctions based on past conduct or status is an effective way to reinforce the message that actions have consequences, not only to the individual or entity targeted, but to others now and in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also clarifies the validity of sanctions listings that rely on the minister's discretion to impose sanctions. In doing so, the bill provides certainty and transparency to the Australian community, so that they can effectively comply with sanctions laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
