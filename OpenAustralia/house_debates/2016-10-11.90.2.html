       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations on your election. Today, I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, as well as those of the electorate I have come to represent, namely the Darkinjung and the Guringai people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to recognise the contribution of my predecessor, Mrs Karen McNamara, the former member for Dobell, and thank Mrs McNamara for her good wishes. And, on behalf of the people of Dobell, I would like to share our special appreciation for the first and longest-serving member for Dobell, a minister in the Keating government and my friend,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lee" rel="nofollow">

        I have always been part of a tribe—the second of eight

         McBride
        </a>
        kids—five boys and three girls. It was the day-to-day negotiations of who was going to clean up the kitchen that taught me the value of acceptance, tolerance, perseverance and the very literal meaning of not blowing up the place!
       </p>
       <p>
        Growing up my family moved around a lot, changing schools seven times. I was lucky enough to live in the inner west,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        and Nauru—which, looking back through the eyes of a six-year-old, was a tropical island paradise—before finally settling on the Central Coast. When I first came to the coast, it was the late 1980s. Big hair was in, acid-wash jeans were 'must have' items, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_Eels" rel="nofollow">

        was the No. 1 hit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can still remember how alive I felt going for morning surfs at Soldiers Beach before school with my dad and my brothers. With the sun slowly rising from the east, cool sand under our feet and crashing waves around us, we would jump on our boards and plunge headfirst into the vast, salty water of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Ocean
        </a>
        . Later, those surfing trips we went on when we first moved to the coast would become analogous to how we lived our lives as adults—bold, confident and free.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like so many young people on the coast in the 1990s, I had to leave the area to study. At the time we did not have a local university I could attend to gain the skills and training I so badly wanted and needed to become a pharmacist. My friends and I did not have local jobs to support us through our years of training, or even the option to come back and work for local industries. So, once I graduated, I moved again. Throughout my twenties I lived and worked in Forbes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Vale" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        . I would have kept moving except that one day I got a call from my friend Toni about a job going on the coast. I packed my bag to come home.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a pharmacist—the only pharmacist in this parliament—I have had the privilege of working in health for 20 years, in mental health for 15 years and at my local community hospital in Wyong for the last decade. During this time I have had a front row seat to the changes that have been happening on the coast. I have witnessed the area's booming population growth first hand and the life and energy it funnels into our community. I have also witnessed the strain these changes can place on our infrastructure and local services—the struggle of families living in suburbs and towns and villages without the ability to support their most basic needs. However, this does not define who we are. In Wyong Hospital pharmacy, despite constant pressure on the department we worked together and commissioned the cancer care pharmacy, so chemotherapy is now manufactured on site and patients like my friend Laurie can have treatment locally and discuss their concerns with expert oncology pharmacists. As a former councillor with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyong_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Wyong Shire
        </a>
        , despite the budget being stretched, working with Labor council members
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Matthews" rel="nofollow">
         Lisa Matthews
        </a>
        and Doug Vincent we had the bonds for not-for-profits waived so community groups like 2261 Out of the Box could host family feasts without somebody having to put hundreds of dollars on their credit card, and there is being a volunteer director of the Wyong community
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which filled a gaping hole left by the big four in our town and this year, again, stepped up in helping to 'Kick Start the Heart', the only regional netball club in the inaugural Netball New South Wales Premier League.
       </p>
       <p>
        While modest, these achievements are examples of the type of work many thousands of people on the coast are doing each and every day to better our community. We have a population to rival nearby regions; we have the ability and the will to change our area for the better; and, as a group, we have decided that now it is our time to thrive. In much the same way that I am no longer the person I was all those years ago, Dobell is not the same as it was in the eighties or the nineties. To many people the electorate is nothing more than a name on a list and a set of lines on a map, but to me, my family and our friends it is our home town. It is the bustling beachfront cafes at Wamberal, the cycling tracks around the Tuggerah Lakes, the beautiful

         Wyrrabalong National Park
        </a>
        , the charm of the rural townships of Dooralong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Brush" rel="nofollow">
         Cedar Brush
        </a>
        , where my great-great-grandfather was a pioneer, and the region's natural beauty that first drew us to the coast. It is the reason we never want to leave.
       </p>
       <p>
        The population that once sat just under 200,000 has grown to 330,000 and is soon to be a booming 400,000—the ninth-largest urban centre in Australia. Our region now boasts 21,000 local businesses, a university, major teaching hospitals and a growing number of new homes. Our proximity to major cities, population and growth have turned a former holiday destination into a serious regional player and a community with a powerful voice. Yet, sitting along the overwhelming natural beauty of the region and the energy and vitality of its people is a jarring social reality—the harsh truth of disadvantage. Unemployment and a lack of local jobs are real and persistent problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coast's greatest strength is its people. Dobell is an area with one of the highest populations of young people in the country, which means we have a great potential for developing tomorrow's leaders. However, the latest job figures for the Central Coast reveal that over 16 per cent of 15- to 24-year-olds are unemployed, compared with the national rate, which sits at 12.7 per cent. That is 16 per cent too many. In an area where local jobs are limited, it is of real concern that only one in two students have the chance to finish high school. For the many working people who call the coast home, one in four travel outside the area for work. This daily commute can take anywhere between two and four hours. Locals will tell you it has not really improved all that much since I was young, and it is two to four hours that people could be spending with their friends and loved ones and not travelling for work.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it is one thing to know the issues and another to do something about them, which is one of the reasons our region would be best served by a Labor government. Only Labor believes in reducing inequality and promoting greater social and economic equity by providing individuals and families with the tools they desperately need to make a positive change in their community. With Labor, we can help raise high school completion rates through the provision of a quality education supported by full Gonski funding. Our young people are motivated and talented and deserve the same start as all kids in life. With Labor, our business community can flourish, with the support of better infrastructure and policies that attract industry and generate local jobs. Our business sector is smart, dynamic and community minded. It does not need this government throwing obstacles in its path, like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        , the roll-out of which in my region has been nothing short of disastrous. Labor created Medicare, and only Labor will protect Medicare. As a pharmacist, too often I saw patients and those who loved them forced to make decisions that no-one should have to make about skipping medications or pathology tests because they simply could not afford to pay. Our young people, families and the elderly can and must be able to continue to access the best in health care rather than simply what they can afford, through universal health care in the form of Medicare and the PBS.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last 10 years of my working life have been dedicated to Wyong Hospital, a public hospital in a low-socioeconomic area that provides quality care to thousands of locals. Today, Wyong Hospital, which was built by our community for our community and belongs to our community, is slated for privatisation by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Liberal government. So that you can understand how important this hospital is to our community and the reason we feel it should stay in public hands, I want to share with you a little about how it came to be.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 1950s, with a growing population and no local hospital, a group of dedicated locals banded together, fundraised endlessly and worked tirelessly to find a community solution to a very real community problem. In fact, it was 1956 when the first Wyong Hospital committee meeting was held, and 1980 before the first patient was admitted to the newly constructed 100-bed hospital.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_O'Connell" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        who was a Labor member for Peats at the time was so impressed with the dedication of locals with support of this hospital he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It amply demonstrates that when we work for the community, we should not be daunted by delays, frustrations or obstacles placed in our path, as tenacity and determination will overcome such problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this area of patient centred care, why are conservative governments in such a rush to retreat from public hospitals? More than balance sheets,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">
         KPI
        </a>
        s and so-called health outcomes, public hospitals in regional areas care for our community. They offer us hope when we are sick; they provide expert care to newborns and empower new mums; they give us a safe place to stay when we need refuge; and they are the rooms where we mourn when we say our last goodbyes.

         RSL
        </a>
        Club, Toukley-Noraville Progress Association, the Toukley Chamber of Commerce; to the Wyong Hospital Committee, Wyong Hospital Trust, Wyong Hospital Auxiliary and the Tuggerah Lakes Auxiliary; to the everyday members of our community who fought for almost 30 years for our hospital to be built and are now fighting to keep it in public hands, I am here to tell you all that I believe that Wyong Hospital must stay our public hospital. I support you when you say we want to and must keep it in public hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst on the topic of health, I thought I would take this opportunity to speak about an area that I have worked in for 15 years and that is very close to my heart, mental health. As you may know, October is Mental Health Month, this week is Mental Health Week and yesterday was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Mental Health Day
        </a>
        . Each month, week and day that we mark as a community to recognise mental health is important, to focus on how far we have come and how far we have to go. As a pharmacist, mental health worker and carer, I will use this platform so that in the future those living with mental illness and those who love and care for them will live better. Despite the barriers broken down, the programs launched, the modest boosts in funding, stigma persists and lives are being lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the National Mental Health Commission, 'Each year one in five Australians will experience mental illness'. They go on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over a lifetime, nearly half of the Australian population will experience mental illness … Less than half will access treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMHC" rel="nofollow">
         NMHC
        </a>
        has noted that in the last decade the number of Australians taking their own lives has increased to more than 2,800 a year, which is more than twice the number of people killed on our roads. This needs to change, across our neighbourhoods, towns, cities, regions and across the country, so that lives, like that of my friend Graeme, are not lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a young pharmacist I took a locum post on the other side of the world and found myself working in mental health but what made me stay was working with highly motivated and dedicated social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists, nurses and psychiatrists who, working together, each and every day could change lives. My firsthand experience working in health for almost 20 years is of hardworking and capable staff, who do a great job in very difficult circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia today, where you are born, where you grow up, where you live, where you work and where you age matter. The social determinants of health are now well understood; however, there is a gap between the rhetoric and the reality. I would like to share with you a quote from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Marmot" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Marmot
        </a>
        , President of the

         World Medical Association
        </a>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Why treat people and send them back to the conditions that made them sick?
       </p>
       <p>
        When he made this observation, Professor Sir Michael Marmot was a medical student at an outpatient psychiatric clinic at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Prince_Alfred_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
        </a>
        , Sydney. It was the 1960s, and the psychiatrist at the clinic had instructed a patient to 'stop taking blue pills and try these red pills', made an appointment for a month's time and sent the patient, still a picture of misery, home. Dr Marmot goes on to say that the idea that this patient was suffering from red-pill deficiency was not compelling. You cannot separate a patient and their condition from life's circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately, our health care and mental health services have improved considerably since the 1960s.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I was part of too many case conferences where the only option for discharge accommodation was to hand a patient a telephone book and ask them to try to find somewhere to live. This must change. In Australia in 2016 we should not, from any hospital or any health service, discharge anyone to a car, a couch, a cave or 'No fixed abode'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joining me in the fight for better health care, improved infrastructure for local families and businesses, and the opportunity to create a thriving local community were 300 dedicated individuals who door-knocked 50,000 homes and worked tirelessly on the campaign to win back Dobell for Labor.

          Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations on your appointment to that role. I respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet, the Ngunawal people, and I acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of my home, the Wajuk people of Nyungar country. I pay my respects to elders past and present, and I am grateful always for the grace, good humour and thoughtfulness of Indigenous leaders in our community who seek to help this nation reconcile its dark history so that we might together create a better future for the first peoples of this vast and beautiful country.

          My name is Madeleine Mary Harvie King, and I stand here today the elected representative of the people of the city of Kwinana and the city of Rockingham. Together these cities make up the federal seat of Brand. These are the places of my childhood. These are the places I call home. Brand is a place of remarkable diversity, with some of the most beautiful beaches in the country, including pristine Singleton,

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River_Colony" rel="nofollow">
           Swan River Colony

          was first declared in 1829. To the east of Brand, rural and semi-rural life coexists with one of the fastest-growing suburbs in the country: Baldivis, a place where I used to go bushwalking with my dad and where brumbies would run, or so Dad would say.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is the singular and greatest honour of my life to have been elected by the genuine, honest and hardworking people of Brand to represent my home town and its surrounds in this the federal parliament of Australia. It is sometimes hard to reconcile the sandgroper kid born in Calista—growing up in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
           Shoalwater Bay
          </a>
          , enjoying a childhood without care and often without shoes, running through the dunes to the beach or riding bikes through the suburbs with my school friends—with my becoming a member of parliament, but here I am. I am very proud to be here and I am very proud to be the federal member for Brand. I am excited by the challenges to come and I am humbled by my election result.
         </p>
         <p>
          I and the Labor Party owe the voters of Brand a great deal for delivering the first safe Labor seat in WA for 15 years. This significant result on 2 July demonstrates that the community shares my personal convictions, which reflect those core Labor values of fairness, equality, equity and inclusion. Like the people of Brand, I believe in an Australia that is a confident; progressive and enterprising nation, valuing its high performers whilst recognising that those less fortunate and vulnerable are equally valued and deserving of help provided with respect and dignity.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also share these values with my three Labor colleagues who have preceded me. They have each made a giant contribution to the nation, to WA and to the seat of Brand, held by Labor since its creation in 1984. The Honourable
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Fatin" rel="nofollow">

          </a>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
           Indian Ocean

          , as well as in the Pacific. It was a tectonic shift in policy, which saw HMAS
          <i>
           Stirling
          </i>
          on Garden Island expand dramatically and become the largest and most significant naval base in the nation. This has had great benefits for Rockingham, which supports the naval presence and has welcomed Defence personnel from across Australia into the community over many years. As the member for Brand, Kim Beazley served this nation as Labor leader and Leader of the Opposition. I thank Kim for his continued support, and for launching my campaign. I can tell you, my friends, when Kim Beazley launches your campaign, you know it is launched. He was spot-on in his prediction for how the vote would go in Brand.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Honourable Gary Gray AO was the third member for Brand, and my immediate predecessor. Many of you know Gary, and many have served with him in previous parliaments. He has served the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
           ALP
          </a>
          as its national secretary and has been a tremendous contributor to this party. Gary's contribution to the economic development of WA and Australia through his work on resources and energy policy is well recognised throughout the industry and across the political spectrum. He was a tireless advocate for the community of Brand and worked hard for it every day.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was my very great honour to have worked for Gary in Prime Minister Julia Gillard's Labor government. I thank Gary for his encouragement and support. Gary and his family ran the Hillman Primary School booth on polling day. His wife, sons and in-laws—the fantastic Walsh family—all helped out. Although recovering from her first chemotherapy dose, Gary's wonderful wife, Deb Walsh, was also out on polling day. I only wish I could give as much support to Deb in her cancer battle as she, her family and her husband have given to me.

          Colleagues, I am the youngest daughter of John Harvie Morris and Diana Eve Pizer; the youngest sister of Rebecca, Peter, John, and Matthew; and sister-in-law of Bronwyn, Robyn and Lara. I am the aunt of Levi, Hannah, Izak, Jacob, Eli, Eva and Alex—the Morris club. I am the very fortunate wife of James Murdoch King. I am so pleased that my mum, Diana, my brothers Peter and John, my nephew Eli and the love of my life, Jamie, are all here today, as is my oldest friend, Vanessa. We met when we were six.
         </p>

          Today, 11 October, is my dad's birthday. If
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Morris" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          were still walking this earth, he would be 90. But after a good and fulfilled life of service, love, faith and family, Dad died three years ago. I think of him every day with happiness, knowing that he was enormously proud of each of his children, and that he would enjoy being here today—perhaps slightly surprised at my new job, but immensely proud. He and Mum have always encouraged me to do all that I can, and I am grateful for the support and love they have always given me. My father grew up in England during a time of war and witnessed the violence and fear that comes with it, hiding from bombs with his mother and sister under the kitchen table and watching his mother help put out the fires caused by the incendiary bombs that fell across Plymouth. As soon as he could, he followed his father into the war, joining the

          and, along with my grandmother, his wife, Ellen Higgins, was among that most confronted of generations that lived through the turmoil and utter catastrophe of Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Years later, from the distance and the relative peace we enjoy, it is difficult to fathom the destruction and violence that wasted the lives of so many millions of people. But we get some impression of these dark times from the truly shocking images we see of the current conflict in Syria. Without doubt, peace is hard work, but work at it we must. There is no prosperity without peace, and the world is diminished while such brutal and inhumane conflicts continue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Like many, my dad left post-war Britain, and arrived on a boat in Fremantle in 1956. He was among the first employees in the newly-built
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP" rel="nofollow">
           BP
          </a>
          oil refinery in Kwinana.

          My mum is a Perth girl, born and raised in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Perth" rel="nofollow">
           West Perth
          </a>
          . Together they built a house on a sand dune in Shoalwater Bay. Together they built a home and a future for my sister, my brothers and me. As well as raising five beachcombers, my mum, Diana, owned and ran a drapery store on Railway Terrace, Rockingham. It was called
          <i>
           The Family Traders
          </i>
          . My nan, Peggy Pizer, worked in the shop too, and together Mum and Nan sold all manner of haberdashery. I am empowered by all the people who tell me regularly across the district of Brand that mum's shop was the best in town.
         </p>
         <p>
          I enjoyed an education at the local
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Bay" rel="nofollow">
           Safety Bay
          </a>
          and Rockingham Beach primary schools and at Safety Bay Senior High School. I went on to university, where a whole new world of opportunity opened up to me. However, sadly, this path is not one well travelled in the community that I represent, which has among the lowest educational attainment rates in the nation. When I first went to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
           The University
          </a>
          of Western Australia, I was quite unaware that my being there was something unusual for a young person from Safety Bay. That this situation has not changed much in 25 years troubles me deeply.
         </p>
         <p>
          I know much more now than I did then. I understand better the barriers that exist for many in our community and how they hinder people's ability to access further education. No good can come from governments putting barriers in the way of aspiring young people. The very idea of exorbitant fees for university degrees is one such barrier. It has a limiting effect on people. It pre-empts the aspirations of many by causing them to think they will never get there; that they will never be able to afford it. And, by constraining access, by constraining aspirations, we build the very ivory towers we have long sought to pull down.
         </p>
         <p>
          University education gave me opportunities that might not have been available without Labor's commitment to opening up access to higher education in Australia. I want to ensure that a young person growing up where I grew up has at least the same opportunities today that I had. I want to ensure that young people enjoy a diversity of choices in how they build their future.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, as well as education and training, there is a real need to provide meaningful jobs for people. With the construction phase of the WA mining boom at an end, unemployment and under-employment is affecting families across Brand, indeed across the whole of Western Australia. Successive state governments in WA have supported the need for an outer harbour to be constructed in Cockburn Sound to ensure the further economic development of WA.
         </p>
         <p>
          First raised in the 1960s, it is only in recent years that bipartisan support has withered as the Liberal state government has focused on other, mainly road based, priorities. Progressing the construction of the Kwinana outer harbour will unlock latent potential across existing industries and attract new industries into the area, along with an estimated 25,000 new direct jobs. Support for a Kwinana outer harbour ticks all the boxes. It will help grow the local, state and national economies, it will create long-term jobs, it will encourage innovation through the application of modern technology to port operations, and it puts people first by supporting a sustainable industrial base to underpin the flourishing communities in Brand.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once again, Kwinana stands to be at the heart of advancing the further economic development of WA. I will be right behind this effort, and will do all I can to bring this game-changing project to fruition for the benefit of the electorate of Brand and the people of Western Australia. Failure to recognise this project for all that it is will ultimately mean the state and the nation misses out on this long-term beneficial and vital infrastructure.

This work has brought me into the orbit of many leaders in their fields—great scientists, educators, academics, policy experts, professionals across many fields, astounding artists, and managers and supporters of the arts community. Among many things, my experience has taught me the pivotal role science and research has had in the development of Western Australia.

          We should remind ourselves that without collaboration between scientists, government and farmers in the 1930s to develop dry-farming techniques and high-yield and disease resistant grains, WA wheat farmers would not be about to produce—despite frosts—a likely record crop, half of the entire wheat crop of this nation. The lion's share of this great grain will be exported to our near neighbours and friends in Indonesia. And this significant export venture sets sail from

          overlook Cockburn Sound. It is the largest grain-exporting and handling facility in the nation and is a constant reminder of the value of agriculture to Western Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Research and development has always driven the growth of WA's largest commodity export industries of resources and agriculture. And it is important that this country supports the science and research that will be required to care for our land and oceans, to get the most from these resources without desolating the soil, the air and the sea.

          In my work, I have been most fortunate to see the beginnings of astounding science projects. Take the visionary work of Professor Peter Quinn, leading a team at the forefront of international efforts to move forward by looking backward in time, considering questions no less fundamental than: how did the universe, the stars and the galaxies form and evolve? They are the builders of the

          </a>
          for Radio Astronomy Research, the world's largest public science data project is happening in Perth and in the radio quiet of the vast Murchinson, where you can lie on your back at night and see theEmu in the Skyconstellation as clear as our Indigenous sisters and brothers have seen it for over 40,000 years.

          In my work, I have met inspiring people, such as Professor Gia Parish, who conducts research around the world in advanced sensing technologies, such as chemical sensors for environmental and industrial monitoring; while teaching the next generation of engineers; while taking on extensive administrative duties as head of school; and while raising two young girls and participating in her community. She is an inspiration.

          These are the people who work in our universities. These are the people who are building the potential of this nation today, tomorrow, and into the future. Their work and their service should be acknowledged and celebrated much more than it is. Without them, we all miss out on Australia being all that it can be.

          If we can understand the importance of science, technology and research then we must also appreciate and understand the importance and value of the arts and humanities. They provide us with exciting and often new ways to give us a 'sense of place'. In turbulent and challenging environments, arts and humanities can provide the bedrock of tolerance by fostering a better understanding of the diversity of thought, knowledge and cultures that swirl around each of us. Through the arts in particular, we are challenged to look more closely at how we see ourselves and others—reimagining ourselves, our place in our communities and our place in the world.

          Western Australians, with the desert at our back and the vast Indian Ocean before us, are widely thought to have the most isolated capital city in the world: Perth. But I disagreewith this because, truth be told, we are the most connected Australian capital city. You just need to consider that more than 60 per cent of the world's population lives in arguably the most dynamic region on earth, directly to our north. Perth is the gateway to the Indo-Pacific. This is no secret in Western Australia, with businesses actively building relationships throughout the region for many decades—relationships that create opportunities in trade and relationships that create opportunities for closer engagement with our regional neighbours.

          There has been a theory floating around that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" rel="nofollow">
           David Bowie
          </a>
          may have been the glue that held the universe together and that our geopolitical landscapes and our lives within them were perhaps a little more comprehensible before this visionary artist died at the age of 69 in the early days of 2016. This theory reflects a feeling of bewilderment for many: upset as popular cultural icons have died unexpectedly; disbelieving as the nation that fought to save a western European civilisation elected to walk away from its incredible legacy; and, most seriously, shocked at the rise of an odious kind of politics in the US that seeks to harness those most human traits of reservation and resistance to change, magnify and distort these feelings into a disturbing wave of dread and mistrust that ventures into hate. We know these politics and we know that at their root is fear. Fear is a tremendous and dangerous weapon, and its use is as old as the hills of this, the oldest continent on the face of the earth. In one way or another, fear of change infects every generation, and every generation laments the degeneration and ruin of the times.

          Murdoch observed in the late 1930s that we spend too much time seeking for a continuing city in a fluid world where it can never be found, and that:

          The fear we have to conquer if we are going to seek wisdom is the fear of change.

          A self-confessed conservative, Sir Walter felt:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … like kneeling down daily and praying to be delivered from this shameful fear of change; and praying that my country may be delivered from it."

          History shows us that we as Australians should not fear change but show the faith in ourselves, and in each other, that will allow this country to continue to forge its own progressive path. After all, we led the way in women's political rights as the first country to give women the right to stand for parliament, we introduced a minimum wage and fair and safe working conditions for all, we have built a stable multicultural society and we built and will always protect our system of universal healthcare that is the envy of the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is hard to reconcile these great legacies of our progressive nation with it now being held back on the issue of marriage equality due to a fear of change. My sister Rebecca Morris and her life partner, Robyn Rollston, have been together much longer than the 17 years I have been married, yet our country does not treat our loving relationships equally. This is not right. As representatives of the people, we may do well to consider that a majority of Australians choose to live and let others live and are accepting of social change.

          I only have to look to my grandmother's life to know how fear and societal norms constrain people and provide them with stark choices. My grandmother, Hannah Margaret Pizer, or Peggy as she was known, was born in Coolgardie and grew up in Kalgoorlie and Meekatharra. With the love and support of her parents, Peggy Pizer raised my mother as a single parent. Perth in the thirties and forties was a conservative place and the societal pressure on my Nan and her family to give up their baby for adoption must have been overwhelming. But, lucky for me, love won out and the Pizer family rallied around Peggy and her baby daughter, my mum, Diana. It was a truly courageous choice. But it was not without cost and not without sacrifice. Peggy Pizer was an important part of my life. She lived with our family in Shoalwater Bay since 1965 and died nearly 25 years ago. As I drive between Kwinana and Rockingham and pass her final resting place in the East Rockingham Pioneer Cemetery, I always think of her.

          I thank my understanding teammates on the hockey field—the University Soaks Scrigglers. I have played hockey with these great women for years, some since I was 18. Catching up with them and playing this great game is one of the most fun things I do. My WA masters hockey teammates played Queensland today in the national championships in Hobart. Sadly it was a draw, but I guess I will take that against a loss. I started representing WA in masters hockey seven years ago. It is a wonderful community and you had better believe how fiercely competitive these women are. I would like to have been with them all in Hobart this week, but there is the small matter of parliament!

          The election result in Brand is testament to the calibre of the people that worked on the campaign: Andrew O'Donnell; the amazing brother and sister team that is Georgia Tree and Callan Tree; Helen Hansen; Bridget Edwards; Amy Le Ray; John and Peg Cotter; the many volunteers that helped making calls in the community and knocking on doors, among them some from

Also Mike Barnett, the former member for Rockingham and Speaker of the House in WA, was critical to the effort and kept us all on an even keel. I thank you all, yet I cannot thank you enough.

We might see a few dolphins, and we will swim among the seals. There is nothing quite like having an Australian sea lion swim alongside you, poke its head near yours, and follow you as you go—there is simply nothing. There is no place I would rather be. There is no place I would rather call home, and this is the place I have the honour and privilege to represent. Thank you for your indulgence.
