       <p>
        Today, which marks the 10th anniversary of the Howard government, I thought I would share with the House the impact of Howard government legislation and the way it has changed the life of one ordinary Australian who lives in Shortland electorate. This gentleman applied for the disability support pension after the government brought through its Welfare to Work legislation. This gentleman was assessed by Centrelink and it was determined that he had the level of disability—he obtained the 20 points needed—to be eligible for the disability support pension. But, in their wisdom, Centrelink determined that, with the right amount of training and the right amount of support, this gentleman would be able to return to the workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        I assisted him in putting in an application to the authorised review officer and wrote to the Minister for Human Services because I was very concerned that he had a certificate from his doctor stating that under no circumstances should this man work. He had been assessed as being eligible for the disability support pension, yet, because of the legislation this government has passed, it was determined that he should return to the workforce and that he could do so with the appropriate level of training. I might add that the gentleman has no literacy skills whatsoever. He comes from a non-English-speaking background, and the only work he has ever done has been manual work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyhow, Centrelink referred him to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRS" rel="nofollow">
         CRS
        </a>
        Australia. I am sure it will not be any surprise to the House that the letter I received from CRS Australia stated: ‘We will not be offering this gentleman a vocational rehabilitation program.’ He had previously participated in an occupational rehabilitation program that included a physical upgrading component and explored vocational options, but, based on his physical restrictions, limited transferable skills, limited educational background and non-English-speaking background, CRS Australia decided that he was unsuitable for a vocational rehabilitation program. This is the man that this government said should go back to work. This is the man that this government has placed at risk through its mean-spirited legislation that it passed through this House.
