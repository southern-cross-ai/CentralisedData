        My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on recent developments in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

         First, can I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I know, bearing in mind that he is the member for the Darwin area, he has a particular interest in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         and has always been solicitous about their concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government make no secret of the fact that we were deeply concerned by the outbreaks of violence in Dili from 28 April, and the government have been monitoring developments there closely. The situation as of today is calm but there are still underlying tensions in the country. Some groups are seeking to exploit those tensions and there is still the potential for there to be further violence; there is no question of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 5 May the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reissued a travel advice advising Australians to reconsider travel to East Timor at this time, because of the tension and the potential for politically motivated violence. It also advises that Australians in East Timor who are concerned about their safety should consider departing. But, let me also add, at this stage there is no indication that foreigners have been targeted by those who are perpetrating the violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have in a number of ways strongly urged the leaders of East Timor to resolve quickly and peacefully the differences that there are and, of course, to do so with full regard for the democratic institutions of the country, its constitution, the rule of law and international norms of human rights. I have spoken on several occasions to the

         </a>
         foreign minister,

         -Horta. I spoke to him during the course of this morning yet again and registered these messages, and I had a substantial briefing from him about the situation on the ground. We are also, of course, staying in close touch with our ambassador in Dili, and she herself met with Prime Minister Alkatiri today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last Friday, Australia agreed with the rest of the international community to endorse a renewed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Security Council mission in East Timor. It will determine the nature of our contribution, once the shape of any new mission by the United Nations has been decided, but some time will be needed first of all to assess precisely what might be required. As the Prime Minister said last week, we hope that the government of East Timor can resolve this matter quickly and by using its own resources, but Australia does stand ready to offer assistance if requested by either the East Timor government directly or the United Nations. That is a point I reiterated today to Mr Ramos-Horta.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has played a very important role, as all members of the House know, in making the new East Timor possible. We have given a great deal of assistance to East Timor and we continue to do so. We watch events there with concern and with a good deal of diligence because we want to ensure as best we can that East Timor remains a stable country and is able to achieve economic growth in the interests of the welfare of its people.
