        It might suit the convenience of the House for me to update members, as I said earlier today that I would, on potential sittings this evening. It might also suit the convenience of the staff of the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is waiting to receive back from the Senate legislation relating to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        . It is likely that we will have to sit beyond five o’clock this afternoon. I have informed members as soon as possible. I have just had a meeting with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , Senator Evans, and the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ludwig. It is the case that that legislation does need to be returned here because it will likely have amendments that need to then be supported through the House of Representatives. There are commercial issues, obviously, relating to the National Broadband Network of why that needs to happen in a timely manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is certainly my position as Leader of the House—and I know the Acting Manager of Opposition Business shares the view—that the sooner we can depart from here in terms of sticking to the schedule the best for all concerned. I am aware, obviously, that people make arrangements, including arrangements tomorrow. It would be in everyone’s interest if people were able to depart Canberra tonight, if possible, and certainly that is what the government would like to see happen. Perhaps those with some influence with some senators might like to encourage them to deal with that legislation in a timely manner in the interests of the parliament and in the interests, indeed, of the workforce in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        As soon as I get an update from the Senate, I will report back. I will certainly report back just prior to question time, because I am aware that people have schedules, bookings et cetera. For the convenience of the House, I will do my best endeavours. I thank the opposition for their cooperation on these issues.

        <p>
         On indulgence: the opposition appreciates the advice that the Leader of the House has provided. We look forward to further advice. I can only say to him that, as we both know, the other place sometimes operates in a different way.
