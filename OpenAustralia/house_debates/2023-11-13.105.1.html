        My question is to the Prime Minister. Following the Prime Minister's visit to China and attendance at the

         I thank the member for Moreton for his question. We know that the world is confronting serious challenges and economic headwinds and that what happens internationally matters at home. It's crucial that Australia take its seat at the table and speaks up for our interests. That's how we get results for Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that for jobs, trade, the economy and security, engagement matters. That's why I was pleased to be the first Australian PM to visit China since 2016. This is one of our most important relationships. More than one in four of Australia's export dollars derives from the relationship with China. Indeed, more than one in four of Australia's jobs depend upon trade. We have been patient, calibrated and deliberate in our approach to this relationship. It's already paying dividends, removing trade impediments on timber, coal, barley, hay and a range of other products and creating a path forward for wine exports from Australia. Between January and August this year, and there's been a huge bump since then, Australia exported to China $6 billion worth of products that had had impediments placed on them. Compare that to the $85 million for the same period last year. That's $85 million up to $6 billion. It's no wonder the National Party are so pleased about this, as well, because it's had a particular impact in regional Australia.
        </p>

         When I was in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
          Port Lincoln
         </a>
         , they were already signing deals on barley. Barley is already in China from Australia, making a difference. The wine industry has had bumper crops that are sitting there waiting to be exported, and already, there are negotiations on a deal there. I look forward to the removal of any of the impediments across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
         In regard to the visit to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Cook Islands
         </a>
         , it was also important that we engage with our Pacific neighbours. We know what happened with security arrangements during the last government. Our government has reached out and ensured that we are involved in securing peace and stability in the region. As a result of Tuvalu's approach, the Falepili Union, the Tuvaluan word for the traditional values of good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect, is a bilateral treaty that will come before this parliament. It will deal with climate change, including disaster assistance and coastal adaptation; a special mobility pathway to enable an initial cap of 280 people per year; and, importantly, a security agreement, a mutual agreement on any arrangement or engagement with any other state or entity on security and defence-related matters in Tuvalu. This is very important for Australia's security.
