        I rise to update the House on the coalition's major commitment to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        to deliver 600 new federal jobs into Gosford. But more importantly today, in the short time I've got, I would like to deliver a snapshot of the reaction we have been hearing from our local community about why we need those jobs in Gosford and the impact they will have on families and local businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together with the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, we have confirmed that new Australian taxation jobs will be advertised later this month for positions within the new purpose-built office that will be completed within just months on Mann Street in Gosford. Construction to date has injected $7.5 million into the local economy, which has been a massive boost already. Importantly, I am advised that most of the work has been completed by contractors who are local to the Central Coast and our surrounds. A variety of positions will be available at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        offices in Gosford, with the ATO looking for people with tax and legal expertise and customer service, leadership, administration, finance and accounting skills. Ongoing, non-ongoing full-time, part-time and casual roles will be available. Local people are registering their interest with the ATO but are also reaching out to express just how important these jobs will be to rejuvenate Gosford.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a lot more to say about this project, including Labor's dismal failure to back it. But today I would like to put aside my own thoughts and hand over to the voices of people on the Central Coast for whom this will be a game changer. This includes people like Maria, who said: 'The incoming job opportunities for our region are great news for all of us. I just registered to the ATO website in order to receive some more information about current vacancies and applications.' Suzie from Terrigal described it 'as a fantastic opportunity for all Coasties,' and Sandra from Bensville admitted she lives in hope that this will lead to more opportunities. Wayne and Colin at Blackwall wrote to say that they were enthusiastic to see the ATO jobs coming to Gosford. Michael from Kariong took it further, saying that the benefits will go hand in hand with the coalition's $45 million investment in the Central Coast Medical School and Medical Research Institute, an $85 million project that I will say is taking shape thanks to this partnership between the coalition government, the University of Newcastle and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government. Michael said about this: 'I think it shows that you and the coalition are fair dinkum about real services and opportunities. I have registered with the ATO and hope to be working in the new building.' Max from Gosford also linked it to the new medical school, describing both the ATO jobs in Gosford and our commitment to a medical school as 'commonsense public policies that will make our community socially and economically sustainable'.
       </p>
       <p>
        This ties in to another letter from Warren at Wagstaffe, who sees the potential for a financial technology hub in Gosford. Warren is already working to attract a major accounting or legal firm to locate a branch office in Gosford. Trisha at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Point" rel="nofollow">

        also believes in the potential for more companies to see the benefit of relocating their operations to the Central Coast. She believes, as I do, that we should keep talking up our region so that soon multinationals and major multinationals can be attracted to our regional capital city of Gosford. Judy and Bob from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettalong_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Ettalong Beach
        </a>
        wrote to congratulate the government on its vision that the people of Gosford and surrounds will have opportunities to enhance their careers and experiences at their 'home base'. Bob and Judy said: 'It'll create a windfall, including less distance to travel for work, plus the relaxing atmosphere of the Central Coast environment.' Russ at Saratoga declared: 'This is a big moment for Gosford. The infrastructure was necessary to get Gosford CBD off and running. Matching it later as part of a cultural precinct is really going to help make things happen, so thank you for all the hard work in its planning.'
       </p>
       <p>
        To Russ and to the many others who've asked about the progress of a regional performing arts centre in Gosford, I do want to say that we are determined to deliver on this world-class infrastructureâ€”and, in fact, the Turnbull government has committed $10 million towards this important project. It's up to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        , of course, to finalise the location and design, and I'm seeking a community update from the council about their latest progress on this important project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to share this comment from Lauren at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peats_Ridge" rel="nofollow">
         Peats Ridge
        </a>
        , who said: 'As a born-and-bred coastie, I'm really excited about the future plans for Gosford and very fortunate to be a part of this community. I have registered for Gosford's ATO jobs and very eager to be a part of this great opportunity.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is about the future of Gosford, a future defined by Lauren and many others as one of great opportunity. Thank you to everybody in my local community who has contacted me so far. I commit to continue to listen and to keep working with and for our community.
