          I undertook in my answer to a question from the member for Kennedy that I would add to the answer if I had any further information. I inform the House that the nipah virus, which was referred to in the question by the member for Kennedy, is indeed related to the hendra virus. Importantly, I need to tell the House that the nipah virus has never been detected in Australia. There have been a number of outbreaks of the disease in South-East Asia, including in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Singapore. We know from those outbreaks that it can spread between bats and people or from bats to pigs to people. The impact of some of these outbreaks in some of these countries has been exacerbated by more general healthcare conditions and access to infection control.
         </p>
         <p>
          The fact that this virus has never been detected in Australia does not mean that we will not remain on alert. Australia has a good surveillance system in place for a range of exotic diseases that might impact on human health. We also have strong infection control guidelines, which can be used in the event of any outbreak. There is ongoing surveillance activity that is constantly coordinated by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia across all states and territories, with input from my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and his department, covering animal-borne diseases that could cross to humans. I am happy to provide any further information and, if the member or other members opposite would like to be briefed by officials from my department, we are of course happy to take up those opportunities.

           I have two personal explanations and a surprise packet. I am going to take the risk and take the surprise packet first. The member for Boothby.
