        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the Morrison government's actions to address the important challenges facing our nation both at home and abroad are making us stronger and building a more secure future for all Australians?

         I thank the member for Bass. It was good to see the member for Bass in Tasmania on the weekend. It's wonderful to see Tasmania opening up again and the opportunities that are coming to Tasmania. Whether in Tasmania or anywhere else around this country, this has been the most difficult year for so many Australians—for many, the most difficult in living memory. Throughout this time, our government has remained absolutely focused on the welfare of the Australian people. We are standing by the Australian people to ensure that we are delivering on the support that they need right here, right now; during the worst of the crisis; when it first hit back at the beginning of this year; and indeed into the future as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our priority as a government is obviously to address the health impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic—some $18.5 billion of additional investment, supporting our states and territories, but also directly investing in key areas, such as mental health, hospital support, respiratory clinics, and essential

          PPE
         </a>
         and other equipment—but also to address the recovery plan required for the COVID-19 recession. That has included many measures. JobKeeper has meant $101 billion—almost $70 billion has already been delivered—providing the lifeline that those businesses and those employees have needed during the worst of this crisis. That extends to the end of March.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, we announce an additional $3 billion—more than that actually; some $3.2 billion—to extend the COVID supplement for the JobSeeker payment out to the end of March. It is $3.2 billion in additional support—not just into the economy, but recognising that we need to go through further transitions. And our economy is transitioning. We are moving through the gears again. The comeback has begun. Businesses are opening their doors again and they are looking for workers. As I speak to my many members, they relay the stories back from their own electorates of employers who are seeking people to come back into work. We need to connect those who found their way out of work because of the COVID-19 recession back into those jobs. We will continue to support them through the JobMaker hiring credit and the many other measures that were contained in this year's budget to ensure that businesses will be able to invest, employ and bring forward the decisions that will enable our recovery to continue. But these aren't the only issues that we must remain focused on. The threats of counterterrorism and the strategic challenges we have faced in this region have not gone anywhere, and we need to remain vigilant on all of those issues. We saw the terrible attacks in Austria and in France, which we have deplored. Here in this country, we have not been diverted from the task of keeping Australians safe. We will continue—
