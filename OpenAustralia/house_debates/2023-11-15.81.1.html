         There has been far too much noise during questions. I want to make this clear: I've got to hear the questions and they've got to be heard in silence. What comes after is up to the House, but for the purpose of question time, questions have to be heard in silence, without commentary or any effects at all. I'm going to ask the member for Pearce to state the question again so I can hear the entire question.

           I thank the member for Pearce for her question and for her continued advocacy for infrastructure in her electorate, including projects like METRONET—the Yanchep rail extension—and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
            Mitchell Freeway
           </a>
           . As members know, this government has been doing the hard work of cleaning up the mess that those opposite left.
          </p>
          <p>
           We'll soon be announcing our response to the independent infrastructure review, which has already highlighted just how reckless the coalition was when it came to managing, or not managing, our infrastructure investment pipeline. Their legacy, and the path that they set for this nation, is $33 billion of known cost blowouts and an inability to add any new infrastructure projects to the pipeline until the year 2033. It is a breathtaking indictment on every single one of those opposite, but particularly on those in the National Party. It's an indictment on their economic management and their failure to genuinely deliver for their communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           While we've been doing the hard work of responding to the recommendations of the review and negotiating with the states and territories, we've of course also been getting on with the job of construction.

The minister is going to be heard in silence. It was the same yesterday when this minister was on her feet. She deserves the respect to be heard in silence.
