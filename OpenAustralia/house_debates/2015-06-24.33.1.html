       <p>
        This morning I had the great pleasure of joining with the opposition leader and the shadow minister for vocational education at a visit to the

        down in Fyshwick—which is not in Eden-Monaro! It is just down the road here in my electorate.

        Day and it was fantastic to meet with really inspiring teachers and students in my electorate. I want to thank Brian, Fiona and Steve, who are the teachers and administrators there, for organising the visit. I would also like to say 'Hi' to the students of all ages—there were students of all ages. There was even a family group there—a father and son who are both studying motor mechanics. So thanks again to

        It is appalling that today of all days, National TAFE Day, that on this day, when we should be celebrating the success of vocational training, we learn that the Abbott government is seriously considering walking away from national responsibility for the vocational education and training of the future in its federation green paper. That is after the government has already cut more than $2 billion from skills and training including $1 billion from apprentices. This is just another move by a government that has absolutely no vision for this country. We should be encouraging more Australians, including mature-age Australians, to gain qualifications and keep them up to date with the skills that they need for the jobs of the future. Under Labor from 2007—
