        July this year saw the passing of a great Labor figure from

        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bedford" rel="nofollow">
         Eric Bedford
        </a>
        was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        parliament for the electorates of Fairfield from 1968 to 1981 and Cabramatta until his retirement in 1985. Eric belonged to a generation of Labor politicians who left their mark on Western Sydney, the state of New South Wales and definitely our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric was born at Concord and attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Street_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Fort Street High School
        </a>
        before studying at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Teachers_College" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Teachers College
        </a>
        and embarking on a teaching career in country areas. He took an arts degree through external study and returned to teach at Liverpool Boys High School and later
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankstown_Girls_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Bankstown Girls High School
        </a>
        . While at Liverpool boys high Eric met
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        and inquired about rejoining the Labor Party, which he had been a member of since his youth. That was an era when teachers lived close to their local schools, and Eric was one of a number who became leaders in their local communities and distinguished themselves in local government and the school system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric served as Gough Whitlam’s campaign director at the 1966 election, and Gough persuaded Eric to stand for state parliament in the seat of Fairfield, which was vacant as a result of a redistribution. In 1976 Eric was appointed Minister for Education in the first Wran government. Eric fought the education department bureaucracy to introduce Labor policy to establish an education commission, to give teachers and parents a roll in administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric employed more teachers and made reductions to class sizes, introduced programs for children with learning difficulties and multicultural education, including expansion of community languages. Eric is remembered in the local Croatian community for introducing a high school certificate course in Croatian long before Croatia became independent. Eric mended fences for the Teachers Federation and is remembered by many teachers today as ‘Eric the good’.
       </p>
       <p>
        As environment minister, Eric Bedford fought to protect remaining rainforests in New South Wales. Many fine areas are now preserved for future generations thanks to the commitment of Eric Bedford. Eric’s retirement years were marked with sadness due to the death of two of his beloved adult daughters and that gave Eric and his wife, Jo, a special task as grandparents. On behalf of the people of Fowler may I extend condolences to Jo and daughter Judy and especially to the grandchildren. Our community, our state and our nation are the poorer for the loss of Eric Bedford.
