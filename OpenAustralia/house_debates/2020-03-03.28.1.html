        I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate some of the local sporting champions from my electorate. Fourteen-year-old Whitney Stace of Bolwarra Heights has been selected for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        Cricket Academy development squad. He also helps mentor the junior sixes girls league. Whitney has received the best and fairest award at Maitland High School's annual awards presentation for the past two years. Whitney's goal is to play rep cricket for New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sixteen-year-old Caleb Walz of Bolwarra has been recognised for his achievements in soccer and touch football. Caleb took to sport at an early age and has represented his clubs at champion of championships level and now has been asked to referee games. He hopes to play sport professionally one day as well as refereeing at a professional level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifteen-year-old Bayden Smith of Bonny Hills is a dedicated and committed hockey player. He trains up to five days a week as well as playing in championships, umpiring, coaching and mentoring players. He was the junior club person of the year in 2019. Great work, Bayden.

        Fourteen-year-old Zoe Bulmerof Telegraph Point has been playing futsal and football since she was five years old. She is hoping to have a career playing football. She won premiership, championship and state competitions in 2018 whilst playing in the
