        Liberal government came into office, in their first budget in 2012 they indicated over 800 jobs would be cut from TAFE New South Wales. Since then, in preparation for their miscalled Smart and Skilled reform package for vocational education and training, more than 1,200 jobs at TAFE have now been lost.

        has suffered some of the worst cuts in the state. By the end of this term, more than 100 teachers and close to 100 administrative and support staff will have been made redundant. Of these, 15 head teachers are from adult basic education, and 19 teachers teach foundation skillsâ€”also known as adult education skills. Additionally, over half the 16 outreach teacher jobs based in south-west Sydney will be cut. These numbers do not include the hundreds of casual teachers who have been engaged by TAFE. The student association is due to close. Library services are already being downgraded. As a result of these savage cuts, Miller TAFE was forced to close down its highly successful metal fabrication section, forcing students now to travel to Granville or Campbelltown campuses. Staff at

        i were also recently notified of the early closure of their engineering classes. This is cutting face-to-face time, for these various classes, reducing the time available for students to learn. This highly uncertain environment is creating extraordinarily low morale throughout TAFE, resulting in more teachers seeking redundancy than required.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, this is not the end of the cuts. The New South Wales government will maintain their path of changes, downgrading TAFE.

        We are losing the ability to provide vital training and vocational education for young people. Education and training is a vital investment for government if we are to safeguard our children's futures and provide for the future of our nation in a highly competitive world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those opposite have already shown their colours. They have been prepared to cut $80 billion out of schools and hospitals. They should understand the value of education. Investment in education is crucial for young people in finding employment opportunities. The current economic climate, with rising unemployment, calls for more, not less, to be invested in education. Yet what the New South Wales government is doing is mimicking the Abbott government.
