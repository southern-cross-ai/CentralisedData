       <p>
        Sometimes in this job you have to be all things to all people—and, of course, that never works. So my guiding principle is to get on with the job of helping as many in our community as I possibly can. I believe that everyone in Gilmore is eagerly waiting for the formal announcements of funding for projects that have been in the pipeline for years. I've worked hard for these projects and I'm proud to be delivering the very important dollars. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobodalla_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Eurobodalla Shire
        </a>
        council area the funding has gone to three disability enterprises.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is stage 2 of the Muddy Puddles expansion, with an allocation of more than $500,000. It's a not-for-profit organisation offering therapy and education programs for children and young people with a disability as well as their families. In 2014, a group of concerned parents and community members who wanted more local services for their children began Muddy Puddles. They now cater for a wide range of groups, starting from early childhood through to teens, offering individual therapy and group programs run by qualified therapists and educators. Thank you Anne Minato and the board for your patience and dedication to get this project finished, helping parents in so many ways, including navigating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The second group to get help to complete stage 2 of respite and permanent accommodation for young people with a disability was Yumaro. Their project gained $600,000. Again, thanks go to the dedicated board and the untiring work of Mark Brantingham. This project will be such a community asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third project is the all-inclusive playground at Corrigans Park, now named Variety Park, where stage 2 will be completed with the injection of more than $650,000. The Eurobodalla Shire Council and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stuart" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Stuart
        </a>
        have been the drivers of this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalhaven_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Shoalhaven City Council
        </a>
        region will see a number of projects finished—firstly, the Dunn Lewis Centre, which has received community support for years but has struggled to finish. With the addition of $1.9 million, they'll now complete the auditorium, allowing them to have fundraising functions, maintain their programs for youth work experience, out-of-school learning and Work for the Dole and generally being a great community hub. Well done, Gayle Dunn. Now you can see that it's going to be done!
       </p>
       <p>
        The basketball stadium, as part of the Shoalhaven Indoor Sports Centre, is a Shoalhaven City Council project, but the quality fit-out, bleachers and other internal facilities were beyond their budget. So the investment of $2.8 million will resolve that issue. I know Ralph Cook and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Martin" rel="nofollow">

        will feel that their dream is finally coming together.

        Dairy, as well as being a winner of gold medals for milk production quality, will be launching—or perhaps I should say churning—its way into butter manufacture, with a grant of just $14,000. Kara Duncan,

       </p>
       <p>
        Voyager Park in Huskisson currently has an incomplete access path to the memorial area and also has a plan to have a space of honour to recognise our serving men and women. That will be finished, hopefully, by November, with a $600,000 spend. Well done to the Husky

        board and members.
       </p>
       <p>
        The aged-care facility to be built in Kiama will be absolutely brilliant. That, too, is staged, with an investment of $2.3 million dedicated to the community hall and meeting rooms. What a fantastic project this will be for that area. Congratulations to the previous council, with Brian Petschler at the helm, and the current mayor, Mark Honey—but always with the advice and guidance of their general manager, Michael Forsythe.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be a great deal of employment opportunity with each of these projects, and I look forward to seeing those outcomes. There'll be more job-generating announcements in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, I'll continue to focus on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalhaven_River" rel="nofollow">
         Shoalhaven River
        </a>
        crossing and funding resolutions for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        , working alongside my state colleagues for the entire length of that highway. Recently, my state colleagues offered to lobby for funds to maintain the historic Nowra bridge. I truly hope they are successful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just imagine, if you can, a better-aligned highway, more state and federal funding, fewer accidents and an international invitation for tourists to come and visit. I wonder if the South Coast councils and state governments could consider developing a vision for our highway, our future. The Grand Pacific Drive could be such a vision for our region—not just a road of strategic importance but one that doubles up and takes visitors to all of our villages. It would be wonderful. This concept is being explored by tourism groups, and I really believe that they have a great idea that is worth follow-up and advocacy. We in Gilmore can achieve terrific outcomes. We should work on this one together. I encourage our state members, local councillors and the community to get on board and push for a Grand Pacific Drive extension all the way down the coast, making our Princes Highway as great as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        —except that it has better destinations to visit—to get our tourists there and to get our people jobs. It will be fabulous.
