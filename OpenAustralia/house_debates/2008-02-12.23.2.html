         Introduction
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the 24th of November 2007, Australians voted to elect a new government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As one of the world’s oldest democracies, it is easy for us to take elections for granted and to fail to appreciate how fortunate we are, to live in a nation where governments change hands peacefully, as a result of the free expression of the will of the people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have just witnessed a change of government, an event that has happened on just six occasions in the past sixty years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regardless of any partisan affiliation, all Australians can celebrate the success of our democracy when such changes can occur so seamlessly and with such goodwill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        that was sworn into office on the 3rd of December 2007 is committed to a plan to build a modern Australia equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This plan includes the following priorities:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         strengthening the nation’s long-term economic prospects by prosecuting a new productivity agenda, together with a comprehensive strategy to combat inflation, built on a strong budget surplus and a plan of action on skills and infrastructure; a plan for a ranging program of reform to build over time a world class education system through early childhood education, computers in schools for all Year 9 to 12 students, investing in trades training centres in schools and rebuilding our universities;
        </li>
        <li>
         national leadership in infrastructure development coordinated through

         </a>
         ;
        </li>
        <li>
         a comprehensive plan to respond to the threat of dangerous climate change that includes ratifying the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" rel="nofollow">
          Kyoto Protocol
         </a>
         , establishing for the first time a national emissions trading scheme and an ambitious national renewable energy target; long term measures to begin dealing with urban and rural and regional water supply;
        </li>
        <li>
         reforming our national industrial relations laws to reflect an appropriate balance between fairness and flexibility;
        </li>
        <li>
         a plan to reform the health and hospitals system;
        </li>
        <li>
         increasing the availability of childcare as well as increasing the childcare tax rebate;
        </li>
        <li>
         a plan of reforming the Federation by forming partnerships with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
          States and Territories
         </a>
         to tackle the legitimate demands of working families for the delivery of better services from all levels of government;
        </li>
        <li>
         strengthening Australia’s national and international efforts to act on emerging and continuing threats to our security as well as articulating an independent voice in the councils of the world;
        </li>
        <li>
         tackling the growing problem of housing affordability and homelessness; and
        </li>
        <li>
         acting on reconciliation with our Indigenous peoples through an apology to the

         Economic management
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In recent months the world economy has entered a period of greater uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although Australia has in recent years benefited from favourable global economic conditions, in particular the rise of China and the global resources boom, the future is uncertain with downward revisions in global economic growth arising in part from recent developments in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        financial market.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the same time on the home front inflationary pressures have been building over the past several years, creating a further threat to our long term economic growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has been mindful of these conflicting economic currents in developing its five-point plan on inflation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The plan is focused first on fiscal restraint, with the Government aiming to deliver a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        in 2008-09.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Second, the Government is examining options to improve private savings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Third, it will tackle the chronic skills shortages that have been driving inflationary pressure in many areas of the economy for some years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Fourth, a plan of action on infrastructure bottlenecks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And fifth, the Government aims to act on the workforce participation rate by providing practical ways of helping people re-enter the workforce.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to maintaining a strong budgetary position by adhering to a medium term fiscal strategy that keeps the budget in surplus, on average, over the economic cycle; by reprioritising existing expenditure; and by maximising public sector efficiency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Economic reform
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is also committed to improving the quality of government by focussing on outlays that boost the long-term productive capacity of the economy – rather than consumption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Building long term productivity growth following many years of declining productivity growth is a core priority of the nation if we are to have improved living standards for working families into the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s productivity agenda includes reforms to education, infrastructure, innovation, workplace relations and reforming the Federation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Central to the Government’s productivity agenda is its commitment to building a world class education system.  The Government’s long-term ambition is to produce the best educated workforce in the world.  The rest of the world is not standing still as they invest billions into human capital.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to a plan of action to prevent Australia falling further behind against critical global benchmarks.  That is why the Government is committed to an education revolution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Advanced infrastructure is critically important to raising Australia’s productivity in the long term.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government, in cooperation with the States and Territories, will focus on better coordination of infrastructure planning and investment – both public and private.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nationally consistent public private partnerships will be critical in this regard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Infrastructure Australia will be established to improve planning and coordination of Australia’s transport, water and energy infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will also work with the private sector to build a high speed national broadband network – the critical infrastructure platform of the 21st century with the capacity to fundamentally transform business, to overcome much of the tyranny of distance and to boost productivity growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Innovation is another key driver of productivity and economic growth.  The Government aims to foster a culture of innovation by strengthening investment in creativity and knowledge generation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will establish the Enterprise Connect Network to link business with new ideas and technology.  Incentives for business research and development will be focused on lifting investment and competitiveness.

         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        is establishing a new framework for cooperative Commonwealth-State relations in order to take practical steps to rationalise intergovernmental responsibilities and achieve better outcomes in areas of national priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        of Australian Governments (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) recognised at its meeting in December 2007 that there is a need for greater cooperation between Commonwealth and State governments and this should be an immediate priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commonwealth-State funding arrangements will focus more on outputs and outcomes, underpinned by a commitment from the Commonwealth Government to provide incentive payments to drive reforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the December COAG meeting, Australian heads of government identified the regulatory burden on business as an impediment to efficiency that needs to be lifted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Priority areas for action that have been identified include occupational health and safety regulation, payroll tax administration, building codes, trade and professional recognition, simplified accounting methods for the hospitality sector and simplification of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Activity_Statement" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is therefore committed to a significant agenda of economic reform across the spectrum of human capital, physical capital and regulatory reform – with the overriding agenda of building long-term productivity growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Work and family
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Workplace arrangements should deliver flexibility for employers and employees, fair wages and conditions, productive work practices and a balance between work and family responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To meet these objectives, the Government will be introducing a new workplace relations system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In its first legislative act, the Government will abolish the capacity to make
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workplace_Agreements" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workplace Agreements
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new workplace relations system will provide a strong safety net of minimum conditions, the right to bargain collectively for wages and conditions and fairness for both employers and employees if an employee is dismissed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These elements will ensure that employees can fully participate in the benefits of a growing economy, while fostering productivity growth and low inflation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to further measures that will relieve the pressures on working parents and help them to get the balance right as they juggle their work and family responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s initiatives in this area include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         more flexible parental leave;
        </li>
        <li>
         an increased focus on high quality early childhood education and child care, and
        </li>
        <li>
         assistance to small businesses wanting to develop family friendly practices.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Ensuring that parents have access to affordable, high quality child care that helps them to balance their work and family responsibilities is a high priority for the Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To further assist parents with the cost of child care, the Government will increase the Child Care Tax Rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out of pocket child care costs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will also improve access to quality child care through the establishment of up to 260 new child care centres on school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        , university and community sites, and through the introduction of a five-star quality rating system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Families will also benefit from the introduction of universal access to early childhood education for all four year olds for 15 hours per week and 40 weeks per year, and the national rollout of the Australian Early Development Index, which will help communities throughout Australia understand how children are developing by the time they reach school age.

         Education

       <p class="italic">
        The Government was elected on a platform of implementing major changes to Australia’s education system, with the aim of achieving higher standards and better results at every level of education from early childhood to mature age.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government believes that lifting the quantity of investment in education and the quality of educational outcomes is highly important to Australia’s long term productivity growth and economic prosperity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will provide universal access to high-quality early childhood education for Australian children so they can build foundations for lifelong learning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In schools, there will be a major focus on reforms to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes and lift Year 12 retention rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The development of a national curriculum in the key areas of mathematics, science, English, history and Asian languages aims to ensure high, nationally-consistent standards for all students across Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In partnership with the States and Territories, the Government will work to enhance schools’ educational infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Funding of $2.5 billion will be provided for secondary schools to build or upgrade trade training facilities over the next ten years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will invest $1 billion in the provision of computers for Year 9 to 12 students and faster broadband connections to schools.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will also create an additional 450,000 training places over four years, including 65,000 extra apprenticeships, with the first 20,000 places to be available from April 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These initiatives will enhance employment prospects for young Australians and address critical skills shortages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In higher education, the demand for graduates in maths, science and early childhood education will be addressed through incentives for graduates in relevant occupations, including the teaching profession.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help attract and retain the best talent, the Government will improve and expand the

        The Government is committed to ending the blame game between Canberra and the States and Territories on health and hospitals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government believes the Australian people deserve better than a culture of buck-passing between levels of government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why health and hospitals form such a vital part of the COAG reform agenda for 2008.

        The Government understands that this reform task will not be easy and success is far from guaranteed.

        Working closely with the States and Territories, reform will focus on funding for improving performance and health outcomes in key areas across the health system including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         pressures on emergency departments;

        A major study to help Australia set robust shorter term emission reduction targets will report in mid 2008.

        To help Australia meet its emissions reductions goals, a national emissions trading scheme will be established by the end of 2010.

        The Government will also set a 20 per cent target for renewable energy by 2020 to expand the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.

        The Government plans several measures to address challenges relating to housing affordability and homelessness.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Home ownership is out of reach for many Australian families, and many Australian cities are experiencing large increases in rental costs and a shortage of rental stock.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is of particular concern because the current shortage of housing supply affects the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will establish First Home Saver Accounts —accounts that reward disciplined savings with government contributions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These will help people save a larger home deposit and will improve affordability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will also increase housing supply and make houses less expensive – by releasing Commonwealth land for housing, by investing $500 million in housing-linked infrastructure, and by providing financial incentives to encourage private sector investment in affordable rental properties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government understands there is no single solution to the crisis in housing affordability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any attempt at improving affordability needs to involve the three levels of government working together with the community and private sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A National Housing Strategy will be implemented.  Working with the States, Territories and local government, a National Housing Affordability Agreement will be developed which incorporates measures to improve housing affordability for home buyers, renters and public housing tenants.

        In working to advance social inclusion, the Government will work in close partnership with State, Territory and local governments, business and the not-for-profit sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Policies that aim to improve social inclusion and address disadvantage include the Government’s commitment to halve the number of homeless people turned away from homeless services each year for the next five years; universal access to pre-school for four year old children; a national action plan on literacy and numeracy; establishing a dental health program; halving the gap in mortality rates of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children under the age of five within a decade; achieving a 90 per cent year 12 retention rate by 2020 and developing a national employment strategy for those with a disability or mental illness.
