        I rise to speak to speak about the celebrations that took place in my electorate of Calare to mark the 150th birthday of Australia's best-known poet and, indeed, Australia's greatest writer. Of course I am talking about

        . On a personal level, I grew up in awe of him, I guess, because if I listened to any prose it would have been his, and it was. I would argue that he was and continues to be the most skilled person of anyone I have ever heard at making words sound like they were meant to run together. We all know his famous ones:

        , played all sports, and had strong social and political views—but you would notice that he never pushed them at you in his writing.
       </p>

        On a regional level, we have a particular affinity to Banjo. He was born at the property 'Narrambla', which is now considered part of Orange, the largest town in Calare. He then spent much of his early childhood in the small town of Yeoval which is about an hour's drive north-west of Orange on his family's leased property, Buckinbah, before the family moved away from the district.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given this connection to our region, we have just wrapped up a week-long festival in honour of Banjo and his 150th birthday on 17 February. While there were many and varied events during this time, I will mention the unveiling of a new museum—and if I am correct—the only museum dedicated to Banjo. I joined with former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer who is also a great fan to officially open the new museum in Yeoval, named More Than a Poet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yeoval locals, Alf and Sharon Cantrell, have done a mountain of work, as has the town generally, transforming the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Masonic Hall
        </a>
        into an exhibition that tells the story of the life and times of this great Australian. The vast collection within the museum began about 10 years ago with a book on Banjo's work that was passed down from Alf's grandmother. The land on which the hall now stands was once part of Buckinbah and, no doubt, was part of the land on which the young Banjo sat as he herded his father's sheep on land he described as 'dingo infested'—hard to believe now. I can highly recommend the museum to anyone interested in learning a bit more about Banjo.
       </p>

        Aside from the festival, I was thrilled to assist the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">

        of Orange and in particular Len Banks obtain a commemorative stamp celebrating the life of our great poet. I have been advised that the stamp in tribute to this iconic Australian was released last week. Just think about it. As you would well remember, Madam Speaker, we did all have the chance once to have the truly unique national anthem, but we failed the test. It would have been a national anthem like no other. However, I do congratulate all who were involved in celebrating and remembering the life of the greatest poet, I believe, in Australia's history.
