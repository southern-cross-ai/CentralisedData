        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will set the salary for the next Governor-General. It amends the Governor-General Act 1974.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor" rel="nofollow">
         The Governor
        </a>
        -General is appointed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         His Majesty
        </a>
        the King.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is on the advice and recommendation of the Prime Minister and under the provisions of the letters patent relating to the office of the Governor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 3 April 2024, the Prime Minister announced that the King had approved his recommendation to appoint Ms Samantha Mostyn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        as our next Governor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        This follows the conclusion of the term of His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley AC,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSC" rel="nofollow">
         DSC
        </a>
        (Retired) as Governor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Mostyn will be sworn in as Governor-General on 1 July 2024 in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3 of the Constitution prevents the Governor-General's salary from being altered during their term of office.
       </p>
       <p>
        As such, it is necessary to set the next Governor-General's salary at a level appropriate for the duration of this term.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Governor-General serves at the King's pleasure, it is usual to serve for approximately five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, it is necessary to set the next Governor-General's salary at a level appropriate for the duration of this term.
       </p>
       <p>
        In line with past practice, the proposed salary is calculated by reference to the estimated average salary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court of Australia over the notional five-year term of the appointment of the Governor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in the past, a Governor-General has been the recipient of other Commonwealth entitlements—such as a military pension—the annual salary has been adjusted accordingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Mostyn is not a recipient of any such entitlements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Chief Justice's salary is determined annually by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliament must pass this bill before the commencement of Ms Mostyn's term. Section 3 of the Constitution provides:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during … continuance in office.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
