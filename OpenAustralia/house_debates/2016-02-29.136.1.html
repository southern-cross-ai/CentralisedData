        I think it is one of the privileges of being in this place that we get to stand here and share some of the stories of our electorates and some of the people who achieve significant milestones or achieve significant things in our community. It is in that vein that I would like to recognise this morning one of my residents, Minna Rossmann, who, last week, celebrated her 100th birthday. I am sure that many of us in this House have attended 100th birthday celebrations for our constituents. Minna celebrated her special milestone last week and, whilst I could not make the celebrations myself as I was here in Canberra, it was a pleasure to pass on my congratulations to her and her family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minna is a green thumb and a dedicated member of the Beenleigh Garden Club. She says her secret to a long and happy life is being a member of the garden club and being outdoors enjoying the fresh air.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who attended the Beenleigh

        youth program, which is designed to assist refugee and asylum seeker kids and other foreign nationals transition to the Australian culture. Two Tribes has been a huge success. The generosity of those who took part in the golf day last year delivered two very successful programs that benefited 18 young people in our community. The proceeds from the 2016 charity golf day will also assist funding the 'Possibility' program, facilitated by Peter Speaight. The program has won several local government awards and has changed the lives of many disabled people within our community. It is an incredible community program that has changed so many lives for the better. It was a pleasure to be able to take part in the Beenleigh PCYC golf day on Friday and help fund both of these remarkable programs. I would like to thank all the sponsors and other participants, because, without their support and involvement, it would not have been the success that it was.

        Finally, I would like to congratulate all involved with the Australian Budgerigar Society on their fabulous annual show on Sunday. The fantastic event was hosted, once again, at the Eagleby Community Hall. Well done to President Wayne Robinson, the organisers, the volunteers and all the award winners, and also to all the sponsors who were there to support the club again this year. It is a fantastic local community event and it was a great pleasure to be part of it. As the club continues to grow and succeed, it is another great local community group in our electorate.
