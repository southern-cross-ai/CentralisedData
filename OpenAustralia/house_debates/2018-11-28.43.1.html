       <p>
        It was again my privilege to join proud parents, families and teachers celebrating the Leeming Senior High School Education Support Centre graduating students. The young people of this class have worked so hard to reach graduation and have achieved a very significant milestone in their lives. Their efforts and hard work deserve the acknowledgement of our parliament, as does the support of their teachers, led by their principal, Keran Davies, and their year coordinator, Louisa Franceschini-Piil.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was able to offer my contribution to the celebration by sponsoring and presenting the citizenship award to the well-deserving recipient, Zed Dicker-Lee. Zed has been a role model to his classmates, leading by example and contributing to his school community. He is a caring person and is greatly valued and respected by his peers and teachers. Zed made the most of every opportunity and displayed excellent bushranger qualities. He is also a keen sportsperson and always participates with energy and enthusiasm on camps. I was pleased to meet Zed and his proud dad, Ross, at the ceremony.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish Zed and every graduating student the very best as they go on to great things next year. I thank all teachers in the Tangney electorate for their contribution to the lives of students in Tangney as they graduate this year.
