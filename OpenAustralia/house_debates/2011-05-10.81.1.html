         The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Since 2003, work for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Taxation Office
         </a>
         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         ) has been undertaken by Accenture for its Change Program and for other activities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) (i) The Change Program was a very significant information technology and business improvement program designed to support the community, government and to meet internal ATO needs. The program has delivered improved client service through the introduction of client portals and the replacement of a number of ageing systems with a single system for processing tax and superannuation returns. Through the use of enterprise-wide client relationship management, case management and work management systems and processes, it also improved the way the ATO manages its work. It has delivered significant savings to the operation of the ATO.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Accenture was contracted by the ATO to deliver the Change Program. Accenture took the lead role to design, build, test and deploy the Change Program releases. The ATO worked alongside Accenture throughout the Change Program and is now managing the new enterprise systems so they are reliable, responsive and able to support and facilitate future change and innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) and (v) The Change Program Contract was managed via a Head Agreement that provided the terms, conditions and fees. Change Program activities included under the Head Agreement have been reconciled with payment to Accenture of $477 million (excluding
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         ) between 2004 and 2010 to deliver the Change Program releases.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iii) and (iv) Major variations to the contract were incorporated to implement legislation changes for the following at a total cost of $198 million (excluding GST):
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Since 2003, other Accenture contracts for various system related work were for a total cost of $167 million excluding GST. The contracts are as follows:
