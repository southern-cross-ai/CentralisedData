        This week I have welcomed Jessica Weakley, a work experience student from Bomaderry High. She has written for me, and her words are as follows: Australia is a nation of extraordinary people. It fills me with pride to say that no part of our country is greater than Gilmore. It is only fitting that some of those individuals who work tirelessly for their community should be recognised.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen" rel="nofollow">
         The Queen
        </a>
        acknowledges such people on her birthday honours list. The awards give tribute to people who are achieving and are committed to their community. The Queen's honour roll celebrates without discrimination, recognising males and females, young and old from all walks of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge some of the Gilmore residents who were recently honoured: Tina Philip for her service to community health and nursing; Rodney Austin for service to surf lifesaving; Keven Marshall for his dedication to marine rescue;

        , whose charity organisations have helped countless people; and finally, Detective Chief Inspector Kevin McNeil for his involvement in the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these people went above and beyond the usual expected effort. I will summarise by saying that a community is a reflection of the residents, and our people outshine so many others by their actions, their generosity, their volunteering, their service and their professionalism. Gilmore is a great community. Thank you, Jessica.
