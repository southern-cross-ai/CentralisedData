        [by video link] I've had concerns in recent weeks about cuts to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . I'm concerned that this government is slashing NDIS plans by stealth. Constituents have been contacting me by email and telephone and have come in to see me telling me that their NDIS plans have been cut with no rhyme nor reason nor any explanation. If this is the case, we need to be extremely cautious about this, because we know that cutting corners on people's disability plans can lead to such shocking incidents as the case of Ann-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Marie Smith
        </a>
        . The consequences can be dangerous if funding and corners are cut. It is therefore even more shocking that this government appears intent on watering down the NDIS. For example, documents leaked from the government's new Sustainability Action Taskforce instruct staff to slow down in getting Australians living with disability onto the NDIS. That's shocking if correct. The reason for this is to keep costs down, we've heard. That's just a sneaky way to introduce cuts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been inundated in the last few days with correspondence from people who have had their plan cut, who have had issues with their plan. It is something that is very dangerous to the health of those people and their entire families. I have heard lots of stories. One of them is from Debbie, whose son's NDIS support payments were suddenly cut by $10,000. He is 18 and is on the autism spectrum and has an intellectual disability and epilepsy. The unexplained funding cut reflects a lack of consideration given to the needs of the child and the parent as the child matures and greater support is needed for social communication and challenges, let alone transitioning to adulthood. Then there is Erica, who received the double shock of having her son's funding slashed and extended over 24 months instead of 12. That means less money has to stretch even further, Erica wrote to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have received many calls and emails, as I said. Another person who contacted me was Caroline, who has four children, two of whom are on the NDIS, on the respite care program. Their funding has been cut, and now the family is struggling. Both children have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which can present as an extreme behavioural and emotional response. Respite allowed Caroline, the mother, to have more time to devote to her other two children. Respite was also an important opportunity for Caroline for socialisation and interaction outside the home. These are atrocious cuts without any rhyme or reason.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also been contacted by Tabitha, who told me that her daughter's funding was cut by 50 per cent for no reason. This is what Tabitha wrote to me: 'As a result we have had to cut one of her therapies completely, and it was the most effective one. There was no reason for this cut. She is still under seven and on early intervention.' That is very sad news. These are real people struggling to provide their children and families with the best possible care and assistance. The funding cuts introduced by the current government are hurting these families and the NDIS participants living with a disability. How can people have faith in this government when this government has presided over $4.6 billion being ripped out of the NDIS? People are receiving services they don't need and being denied services they asked for. There are difficult and complicated application processes. One thousand two hundred Australians with disability have died while waiting to be funded by the scheme. There have been tricks, and they are trying to ram through this unpopular independence assessment scheme. Why should people living with disability have anything less that the best, as the program was designed? The NDIS is a right and we all have to fight to protect it. I'll continue to listen to my constituents and people using the scheme to ensure the basic principles of choice and dignity are upheld for Australians living with disability.
