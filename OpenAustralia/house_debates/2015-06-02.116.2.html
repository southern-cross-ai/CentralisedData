        Last year, 378 organ donors gave 1,117 Australians a chance at a new life. While this is a positive result, it simply is not enough when we consider that around 1,500 people are on the Australian organ transplant waiting list at any time. People are often on this list from anywhere between six months and four years. Regrettably, a lot of people will die waiting. Now, for the first time since 2009, we see a downturn in organ donation rates across the country. In the first full year of this government, organ and tissue donations fell by 3 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent, much publicised resignation of a very popular television personality from the Organ and Tissue Authority has drawn attention to the very distressing state of organ donation in this country. The government is planning yet another review into this area, ignoring the fact that strategies established by the previous Labor government, including the formation of the Organ and Tissue Authority, resulted in almost a forty per cent increase in organ donations over the previous five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recent decline is not a coincidence, but the result of a number of poor decisions made by the current government. The decision to merge the Organ and Tissue Authority with the National Blood Authority was short-sighted and served as a distraction for the hard-working staff of those organisations. In addition to this, the government's $57 billion of cuts to public hospitals means that resources are simply not available in hospitals, where they are needed, and this has also contributed to the falling donation rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        We do not need another review of the system. We need to stick to strategies that have proven to be effective and that have worked. And certainly, we need to work at a community and family level to raise awareness. In the past I have worked together with a Cabramatta

        , Dr Phan Giang Sang, to increase organ donation registrations in our local community. Dr Sang has written two books on the importance of organ donation, particularly focusing on the way various cultural and religious groups view the issue. In 2012, Dr Sang, in his own practice, registered 32 organ donors. This actually represented ten per cent of the nation's organ donation numbers for that year, and potentially saved hundreds of lives, considering that every single donor can transform the lives of 10 or more people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly, various communities across the country need to be encouraged to work with local experts and their residents to raise awareness and drive up donation rates. It is also critical that families come together and discuss the important issues, particularly their wishes with respect to donations, with their loved ones. Despite an individual deciding to become an organ donor, their family still has to be asked to give consent to a donation, if the situation arises. Talking about organ and tissue donation with loved ones can be difficult, but it is certainly a conversation that is worthwhile and will have a profound effect on organ donation rates. One in three Australians do not know that their family member has consented to organ donation. It is difficult to think about this once a family member has passed away. A discussion would make saying yes that much easier for a family member, and minimise the sense of doubt and, possibly, regret. Organ donation is a gift of life, and one that should be taken very seriously.
       </p>

        This issue is very close to my heart, given that a friend of mine, Debbie Roberts, was faced with a very tough decision after she lost her daughter Rebecca in 2002. Her decision was made a little bit easier because Rebecca made her intentions about organ donation very clear. As a result of her family honouring Rebecca's wishes, two people benefited from receiving a kidney, and another two people benefited from receiving Rebecca's corneas. Their lives have been profoundly enriched because of Rebecca's wonderful gift. It is a gift that all Australians should consider giving, as their decision today can mean the difference between life and death for another Australian tomorrow.
