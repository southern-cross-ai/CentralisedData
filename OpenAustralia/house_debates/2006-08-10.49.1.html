         I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question and for his interest. I also add to your words, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs; I am delighted to have him in Canberra today.

          RAMSI

         , celebrated its third anniversary in July. I think it is fair to say that, with the strong participation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         and

         </a>
         countries, it has done a great deal to help Solomon Islanders put their lives back together again after the ethnic conflict that essentially brought the country to a halt. There is no doubt that RAMSI enjoys very strong public support in the Solomon Islands; perhaps not all politicians support it or appreciate it but certainly the general public in the Solomon Islands are enormously supportive.

         government now, after the upheaval of a few months ago, appears to be stable, and our expectation is that that will continue. The recent Foreign Investment Act has made the Solomon Islands a more attractive destination for investment, with palm oil and goldmining well on the way to restarting, but there still is a very long way to go. For example, we have some concerns about a commission of inquiry into the April Honiara riots, to be led by Mr Marcus Einfeld
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
          QC
         </a>
         . We are particularly concerned that some of the terms of reference could interfere with the independence of the Solomon Islands judiciary and may impact on current court proceedings in relation to the riots. For example, a review of the arrests, charges and detention of two MPs, Messrs Dausabea and Ne’e, relates directly to the independent decision of a magistrate of the Solomon Islands judiciary.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that the Solomon Islands legal profession is also concerned about the terms of reference. The Attorney-General has challenged two of the terms of reference in the Solomon Islands High Court and one of the commissioners has resigned because of these concerns. I mention this simply to underline the fact that there is still a long way to go in the Solomon Islands. We should not just be complacent that RAMSI is there; the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         have done a wonderful job. The media have withdrawn from the Solomon Islands so we do not hear about it anymore, but we remain extremely focused on it and there are still some concerns about activities taking place in that country.
