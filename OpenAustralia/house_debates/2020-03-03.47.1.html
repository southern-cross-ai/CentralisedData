        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the Morrison-

         I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. Our $100 billion pipeline of investment over the next 10 years is helping to create around 80,000 jobs—80,000 jobs, including in the member for Nicholls' electorate. We're fast-tracking construction, we're bringing forward $2.9 billion and we've announced $1.2 billion in additional funding. This is an investment flowing through all communities, including the member for Nicholls'. We're building the Echuca-Moama Bridge, a $323 million project that this government has backed with a $127 million initial investment and an extra $28.7 million. The mayor of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaspe_Shire" rel="nofollow">
          Campaspe Shire
         </a>
         , Adrian Weston, said, 'The Echuca-Moama second bridge is the largest infrastructure project our region has seen. Benefits of the bridge will be significant and wide-ranging. In addition to the regional economic and social advantages, the community will benefit on a daily basis by alleviating bottlenecks and assisting to divert larger vehicles away from the town centre.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Just a couple of years ago, a tree fell on the particular road, which involved a 1½ hour detour for people, particularly families picking up their children, and this is where our infrastructure makes such a difference. It reduces traffic congestion, improves travel times and reduces freight operating costs. Particularly for small business, it's so beneficial—and particularly when it's being constructed. Managing director of McConnell Dowell, Jim Frith, said that he looks forward to working with the local community of Echuca and Moama. He said, 'Retaining as much economic benefit as we can in the Echuca-Moama region by buying local and employing locals through our construction and our phased roll out of this project enables many local businesses to benefit.'
        </p>
        <p>
         You just don't realise the economic benefits by the construction and the small businesses feeding into it. Those alone are just not the advantages that we're getting. It's also in the little things that you wouldn't expect. The

         had a great little article about a group of triathletes. One of them—and this will be particularly important for the marathon runners in the chamber: the Attorney-General, the vets affairs minister and indeed, across the other side, the members for Fenner and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Kingsford Smith
         </a>
         , who like to get out there and run. When you have a better road project, you can run faster times. One of the winners from Team Bruburger, which won the triathlon section, cyclist Sam Eddy, said, 'The legs didn't feel great, if I'm honest, but the surface was pretty quick, and I thought that certainly helped.' So the advantages of infrastructure rollout are not just for small business, not just for commuters; they are also for sporting types. I know the member for Nicholls regards himself as a sporting type. The benefits are right across.

          I hear them yelling out. They are excited about it too, as well they should be! Because every community in Australia is benefitting from the $100 billion, 10-year infrastructure rollout that we're doing across the country.
