        I was very pleased last week to learn that up to 10 local sporting community clubs in my electorate will share a total of $5,498,083 to assist with flood recovery. Last week, the Australian and Queensland governments announced that 200 sites across 20 local government areas are set to benefit from $75 million in joint Australian and Queensland government funding in response to the major flooding and severe rainfall that have occurred since late 2021.

        , were also pleased to hear this good news. As elected representatives, we know how important local sporting clubs are for our communities. Local clubs provide enormous social benefits. Most of them provide a fair, safe and inclusive environment for children and young adults to have an enjoyable and healthy sporting experience. Sport has enormous health and social benefits. It helps children keep fit. It teaches children the importance of teamwork and of winning and losing. Anyone who wants a game gets a go.

        The best thing is that these funds will mean that clubs will be repaired, rebuilt and strengthened through the Community and Recreational Assets Recovery and Resilience Program and the Sport and Recreation Recovery Grant Program. Both programs are funded under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements. This funding will help my local clubs re-establish operations and better cope with future severe weather. Many clubs like Brothers Saint Brendan's in Rocklea and the South Brisbane District Cricket Club were hit badly by the floods in 2011, and had to rebuild. They were then gutted again when it rained in February this year. These clubhouses, change rooms, playing fields and other important community assets are fundamental to volunteers delivering sport and active recreation opportunities in my community.

        Queensland, Oxley Rowing Club and the Carrington Boating Club Corinda, for each securing much-needed funding. I know our clubs are grateful for the funding. Many of them have already emailed my office. Many of them have limited means to fundraise for the money needed for the damage from the floods and rain, so these funds being distributed will be a great help. These projects will, obviously, also create jobs for local contractors, whose work will directly support their communities. Funds from these joint Commonwealth and state grants will help our clubs get back on their feet and better cope with the future severe weather events that we know are coming more and more often.
       </p>
       <p>
        I, along with the state members, look forward to seeing these projects completed and seeing the Moreton clubs back up and running and better protected.
