        On Saturday I had the great pleasure of attending the Mortlock Shield on

        . It started in 1936, so this is the 75th year—with interruptions for World War

        and, last year, COVID. It is the longest-running regional

       <p>
        It traditionally accumulates the leagues of Eyre Peninsula to play off for bragging rights. The

        league has for many years been cut into two, so they field two teams. This year we had a changed format, with the dissolution of one of our leagues. At various times we have had teams come in from

        Sharks—they won it a couple of years in a row there.

        It was a great event. It was the first Mortlock Shield I've been to where I didn't need a ticket. We went all electronic this time round; that was interesting. Congratulations to Robyn Rowsell and her team who ran the competition. That was on Saturday. The shield was concluded on Monday. It was won by Great Flinders—they won their three games. On the Sunday, the Norwood Cup was run for the under-15s, and that also was won by Great Flinders. Well done to Port Lincoln and the team who run the Mortlock Shield.
