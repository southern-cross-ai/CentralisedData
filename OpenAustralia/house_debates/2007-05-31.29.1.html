       <p>
        I think the amendments are uncontentious. We are providing for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to provide the minister with advice in respect of the formation of new therapeutic groups. We are providing for proportionate price reductions for combination drugs. We are providing for lower price reductions for some on-patent drugs in the F2 formulary and we are adding the term ‘biosimilar’ to the term ‘bioequivalent’ in the bill to take account of the fact that there are complex biological drugs coming into our system as well as the more traditional, much simpler drugs. These are the amendments. I do not believe that they are contentious and I commend them to the House.

        <p>
         The member for Gellibrand, the shadow minister for health, is unavailable as a result of an electorate commitment; she has leave from the House. My instructions are, as the minister has outlined, that on the face of it these amendments look consistent with the bill and appear to be non-contentious. Certainly, that is the case with those amendments which relate to ‘bioequivalent’ as compared with ‘biosimilar’, and the minister has explained that both in his second reading reply and in his brief contribution on the committee stage amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The more substantive amendments are as outlined by the minister and appear to be consistent with the thrust of the legislation. In any event, as the minister has alluded to, there is to be a Senate inquiry. If there are any technical deficiencies which interested parties see with the amendments, I am sure the minister, in the usual way, will be only too happy to accommodate any technical suggestions which add to the elegance of the bill.
