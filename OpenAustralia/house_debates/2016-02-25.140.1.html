       <p>
        On Saturday, February 20, people in the Byfield, Yeppoon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Capricorn Coast
        </a>
        and Rockhampton regions in my electorate of Capricornia paused to mark one year since Cyclone Marcia. The category 5 cyclone wreaked terrible destruction along the Capricorn Coast. The one-year anniversary was a time to reflect on how far we have moved forward as a community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, last week I hosted the Prime Minister in Capricornia to specifically mark the anniversary. The Prime Minister attended a morning tea for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        volunteers from the Livingstone and Rockhampton shires, as well as rescue crews from the Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service. They were also joined at this morning tea by the Deputy Prime Minister. It was an exciting opportunity for SES volunteers to spend some time with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        in a relaxed atmosphere so that he could genuinely chat to them and thank them for their contribution to our local community. These groups were among countless volunteers from many organisations that put in a sterling effort to help during last year's cyclone recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers sharing a cuppa with the Prime Minister included: from Yeppoon, Chrissy Matchoss, Russell Sait, Lyn Porter, Adam Murrell, Cindel Richardson, Geoff Hanes,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tait" rel="nofollow">

        ; and from Rockhampton shire,

        , Richard Winter,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Barry" rel="nofollow">
         Cathy Barry
        </a>
        , Louis Magnussen, Rockhampton-Livingstone SES controller Eddie Cowie, Bev Daniels, Chris Bartz, Sam Bertling, Niesha Simmonds, Gary Osmond and Neil Percival—just to name a few. The Prime Minister paid special tribute to these and many other volunteers who played a big role in cyclone recovery, and he took the time to snap many selfies with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the work of Ergon Energy's crews, who worked tirelessly around the clock for weeks after the cyclone to restore power to the region. I thank you for your work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the cyclone the federal government and the state governments contributed jointly towards categories A, B, C and D of the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements program.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        contributed to help qualifying individuals, families, councils, businesses, farmers and householders that were immediately impacted in the most serious way by Cyclone Marcia. In some cases, this included $25,000 grants for businesses and farmers. Joint cooperation between all levels of government—local, state and federal—is the key to helping communities recover: cooperation such as we have seen in the recent NDRRA category D assistance, worth $9.9 million. Federal Minister for Justice Michael Keenan announced the funding with Queensland's Minister for Infrastructure under the joint Commonwealth-Queensland $27.75 million category D Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a further joint NDRRA contribution, both governments are jointly contributing towards the cost of rebuilding the Scenic Highway, also known as Statue Bay Road, to make it better and even more resilient after it partially collapsed during the cyclone. Yesterday I announced a further $300,000 to help fix Rockhampton's Pilbeam Drive,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Street" rel="nofollow">
         York Street
        </a>
        and Frenchville Road areas. This takes the total betterment funding for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhampton_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Rockhampton Regional Council
        </a>
        to more than $5.2 million. Since the cyclone, $5.1 million has been provided for counselling and support for residents severely traumatised by the subsequent events surrounding Cyclone Marcia. More recently, under the $200 million National Stronger Regions Fund, the federal government announced a $10 million contribution towards the development of Yeppoon's beach foreshore as part of a major economic job creation and tourist drawcard following the cyclone. Also, $7 million has gone to Rockhampton to develop its riverbank precinct, and $2.3 million has gone to the Capricorn rescue helicopter for a new emergency hangar.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of Livingstone shire Mayor Bill Ludwig and his team, who have worked very hard to lead the city of Yeppoon and the Livingstone shire back to a better place after the cyclone.
