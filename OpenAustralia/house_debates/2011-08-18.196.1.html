        by leave—I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and move government amendments (1) and (2) as circulated together:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Clause 3, page 2 (line 23), omit “both”, substitute “all”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Clause 3, page 2 (lines 27 to 33), omit paragraph (b) of the definition of worm treatment, substitute:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)there are instructions for use of the product that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)   are approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority under those Codes; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)   accord with an established standard for the product under those Codes, if the product is a registered listed chemical product;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)   those instructions:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)   are for use of the product for treatment of horses for internal parasites; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)   are not for use of the product for treatment of other animals, except other members of the horse family (Equidae), for internal parasites.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment is a minor technical amendment to the definition of 'worm treatment' in the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011. Following the introduction of the horse disease response levy bills into parliament the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry arranged to meet with affected industries, including the Animal Health Alliance, the Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association and the Stock Feed Manufacturers Council of Australia. The purpose of the meeting was to give the organisations an opportunity to discuss any concerns they may have with the proposed legislation. The need for the amendment was identified in discussions with the Animal Health Alliance and the Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association. These organisations provided advice that the original definition of 'worm treatment' was too broad.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment is intended to more clearly identify the products that will be captured by the levy. The amendment clarifies that the levy will not apply to multipurpose worm treatments that have instructions that the product can be used to treat other animals—this was the issue—such as cattle, sheep and goats, as well as horses. However, the levy will apply to products that have instructions for use for horses and/or other species within the horse family Equidae, such as donkeys—I know you are a big fan of donkeys, Madam Deputy Speaker. The amendment was prepared in consultation with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Animal Health Australia and the horse industry are aware of the amendment. I commend the amendments to the House.

        Question agreed to.

       <p>

        Ordered that this bill be reported to the House with amendments.
