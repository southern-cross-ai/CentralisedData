        I rise to thank and congratulate the service men and women and the families of the 7th Brigade from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Gallipoli Barracks
        </a>
        in my electorate of Ryan as they mark the end of their ready period. For over 12 months the 7th Brigade has been in their ready period, which made them the go-to brigade for Australia's land force requirements. The period involves significantly more training as well as a number of operational deployments for the service personnel across that period. Within the brigade there were almost 2,000 people who were deployed during the ready period, on five different operations overseas, as well as 400 members that went for training in Malaysia. They've had a particular focus during the ready period on our pacific region—our neighbours—with a number of them having come to train in Australia with our forces. So, for the service men and women of the 7th, this has been a key period of their service where their skills were put to the test.
       </p>
       <p>
        For their families it was a particular sacrifice requiring the serving mums and dads, husbands and wives to be away from their loved ones for lengthy periods. These families, who play an enabling role, are just as person as the service personnel themselves. They mark the end of this busy ready period with an open day at the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, where those families can come and spend some time on the base and share some quality time together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The open day was well supported by the local community who especially enjoyed seeing the new boxer vehicle, but, like me, they wanted to extend their gratitude to the service men and women of the 7th and their families for their efforts and sacrifices.
