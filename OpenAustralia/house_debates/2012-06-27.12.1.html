        , Arts and Sport proposes to increase the bulk fuel storage capacity and integrate and co-locate storage of diesel, aviation fuel and petrol on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean Territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        All fuel is required to be delivered to Christmas Island by sea. Adverse weather conditions, particularly those prevailing during the swell season, limit and often prevent ships from being unloaded. As a result, bulk deliveries of diesel and petrol are typically scheduled to occur just prior to or immediately following the swell season. The scheduled deliveries can be compromised due to the variances in the swell season, depending on when it commences and finishes. The proposed works include increased access to Commonwealth owned bulk diesel storage tanks, currently leased to the Indian Ocean Oil Company, and hence increased storage capacity at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Smith Point
        </a>
        . Other work includes construction of a new bulk fuel installation on Murray Road including the relocation of bulk petrol storage tanks from the

       </p>
       <p>
        The approved budget is $19.5 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        and includes all costs to complete the project works, including contingencies and allowances for escalations. An increase in the net operating costs of the Commonwealth's fuel assets are expected due to the construction of new facilities and the relocation of re-used facilities.

        In its report the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in late 2012 and be completed by June 2014. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of Commonwealth Parliament Offices at 1 Bligh St, Sydney,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to undertake a fit-out of new Commonwealth Parliament Offices (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPO" rel="nofollow">
         CPO
        </a>
        ) at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney. The Sydney CPO provides offices and meeting facilities for the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, office holders, visiting senators and members. The current CPO is located at 70 Phillip Street and, due to the ageing condition of the accommodation as well as inherent faults that cannot be overcome by refit, it is not desirable to enter into a new long-term lease of the premises; however, a three-year lease has been signed to allow sufficient time to relocate and make good the current premises.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new fit-out will provide office facilities for the Prime Minister and the operation of cabinet. In the past these facilities have been co-located at the CPO but have been on a separate lease and managed and fitted out by the

         Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        . This proposal achieves significant efficiencies and greater flexibility both in the fit-out project and the ongoing operation of the facilities. The Sydney CPO will occupy three levels of 1 Bligh Street, covering a fit-out area of 4, 891 square metres. The Bligh Street address retains the financial business district location with easy access to public transport and the airport. The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out is $21 million plus GST.

        ) proposes to develop a 99-hectare site in the Townsville suburb of Rasmussen in Queensland. The site is owned by DHA. The proposal will develop 1,180 building lots and a medium-density site for the general public and defence families. This is a long-term project providing positive outcomes for both the community and defence families, with the last house being delivered in 2023. The proposal is part of ongoing activity to support the increased Defence presence in Townsville and to increase the quality of the housing stock for our defence families. The Rasmussen site is very well located, being only 11 kilometres from

The remaining 779 lots will be sold to private developers and the public, creating a mixed civilian and defence community while also reducing DHA's net outlay. The project cost of $230 million, inclusive of GST but exclusive of the cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the sale and lease-back program.
