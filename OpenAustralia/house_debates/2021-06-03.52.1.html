       <p>
        The Brisbane Firehawks, based in Cooper in my electorate, have launched a bold bid to become the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        's 17th franchise. If the Australian Rugby League Commission agrees to extend the competition, the Brisbane Firehawks are hoping to become the fourth Queensland team from 2023. Southsiders and all Australians will have an exciting new team to support. A firehawk is a raptor that spreads wildfires by carrying smouldering branches to unburnt areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Brisbane Firehawks have a fantastic logo and colours that reflect the Easts Tigers' heritage and the colours of their hometown and ours, Brisbane. Easts has a 105 year history in Brisbane, and, at the same time, the club has a completely modern approach. They've got a really strong balance sheet. I'm also looking forward to seeing the construction of the club's $7Â½ million community centre of excellence.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to commend Brian Torpy, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the club; the chairman, Stephen Bullow; and the bid consultants, Shane and Brent Richardson, for all of their work to launch this important bid. I also want to thank every single member of the club and every Tiger supporter who is wholeheartedly supporting this bid for the Firehawks to join the NRL. I think every member in this chamber can look into their hearts and, if they really search their souls, they will have to admit that the Firehawks have the strongest and best bid to join the NRL! I know my friend Joe Kelly MP, the state member for Greenslopes, is behind the bid all the way, and so am I. I can't wait to be in the crowd supporting the Firehawks in 2023.
