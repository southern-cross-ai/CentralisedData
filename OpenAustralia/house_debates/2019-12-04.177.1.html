        It's a privilege to have such an auspicious audience here to hear this humble speech. I'm not quite sure I'll live up to your expectations, but I'll give it a red-hot crack.

        <p>
         Thank you very much for the supportive interjections. As we all get to the end of the year and we reflect on the success that it's been, we're also finishing the school year, of course, and reflecting on the significant work of the teachers and the students in our electorate and our local community. In particular, I want to pay tribute this evening to two incredible local teachers who are retiring at the end of this year. They have both been driving forces in the classrooms of my local community in the electorate of Ryan. When you have teachers who have been in the classroom for as long as these two gentlemen, they truly do shape an entire generation within their immediate community.

         The first I want to talk about is Mike Senior. Mike Senior will retire as the principal of Ambrose Treacy College in Indooroopilly at the end of the year after a very long and distinguished career at its helm. Ambrose Treacy College was previously
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudgee_Junior_College" rel="nofollow">
          Nudgee Junior College
         </a>
         . Mike led the transformation from just a junior college to a full P-12 school. That is not an easy task, as I'm sure members in this House would appreciate. He managed the transition absolutely masterfully. He had to deal with some of the hardest issues that a principal faces, such as uniform policy, logos and mottos, not to mention a mass of building work, but he did it with significant success. He loves photography. He was always there supporting his students by taking photos. He always brought a very caring attitude to the job. He promoted his personal values of service and responsibility. In particular, I've always enjoyed attending the service awards of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATC" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         because, every year, they track the volunteer hours of the young boys who come through the college and acknowledge them appropriately. I think that's great form.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mike was recently asked about what it meant to him to be a teacher and he said, 'I can't remember a definite moment when I thought, "I want to be a teacher." It was more that I never thought I would be anything but a teacher. There's no other profession where you can say you are playing an active part in shaping the future, because you are shaping the future lives of young people. It's the best job in the world—a job that just keeps giving.' With that spirit, members in this House will see why he has been such a tremendous asset to our local community. Clearly it runs in the family, because Mike's daughters have both become teachers themselves. It has been a tremendous privilege, as first a local councillor and now the federal member, to work with Mike and see how he has supported his community. I pay tribute to his brilliant career and wish him all the very best in retirement.
        </p>

         The other teacher that I want to speak about is Mr Dean Pfeffer, who is retiring from Moggill State School. This is my alma mater as a primary school. I was there in the years 1991 to 1997. Mr Pfeffer has been teaching at Moggill State School for 34 years. When I spoke at his assembly, which we held to honour him just recently, I reminded him that 34 years is as long as I have been alive. That is how long he has been teaching at this one school. It made him feel a little bit old, but that was not my intention. I was trying to illustrate to the kids in front of me—the very young children—what a long time 34 years is to be dedicated to a single school and community. Because of that, he has truly shaped a generation of kids in the Moggill-Bellbowrie region. He is a man of tremendous energy. He used to ride his bike over the Pinjarra Hills to school, hit the handball court with us kids at lunchtime, and then ride all the way back home. He's had a tremendous impact on those around him. He is a devoted family man with very strong values and morals, and he instilled the same into his students—values of responsibility, excellence and respect. You only got an award if you really deserved it. I remember that very distinctly! He has a tremendous memory. He remembers all of his students. But, most importantly, he has the ability to know what his students are capable of before they even know it themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         As these two gentlemen retire, I give my thanks on behalf of our wider community for helping to shape our community and for their selfless service.
