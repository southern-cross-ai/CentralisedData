        and I attended a community meeting at the Lancefield Mechanics Institute. It was to deal with the Lancefield-Benloch bushfires. We spoke with families who had lost their homes. We met with people who had been unable to return home for days due to the dangers of bushfire and falling debris on the roads. After this the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

        took us out to Benloch to see some of the most fire affected areas. As ever, it was humbling to witness the resilience and resolve of those who had seen their properties damaged by fire. It was a privilege to speak to the CFA volunteers whose courage and quick thinking prevented things from being far worse. We all give thanks that no lives were lost in these fires.

        Bushfires have seared themselves on our national consciousness. Australians have come to accept them as a fact of summer on the dry continent we call home. But facing fires in October is a new challenge. Indeed, this is the earliest fire ban in Victorian history. Let it be a reminder to all Australians who live in areas vulnerable to bushfires: please get your fire plans ready in place early. Make the right preparations to keep your homes and families safe. Let's all hope for a summer free from loss.
