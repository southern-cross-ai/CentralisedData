       <p>
        Earlier today I met the most amazing aged-care worker. To support her residents when they have dementia, if they are from a non-English-speaking background, she learns their native tongue so that they can have support in their final years. As we know, people who regress with dementia can quite often, unfortunately, lose their English language skills. These people who have dementia need our care and our support, and these amazing aged-care workers go above and beyond to help them.
       </p>

        Yet last night, in this government's budget, there was no commitment to these amazing workers and what they do. There is no extra money in the budget for wages. In fact, they said that many of them had not yet received the bonuses that this government promised them. There is no extra money for ratios to ensure that there is adequate staffing in our aged care facilities. There is no extra money to ensure that there is a nurse on site in our aged-care facilities 24/7. This government made no commitment last night to fixing the crisis of aged care, despite their own royal commission's report, titled

        , handing down damning findings and demanding they put in ratios to help our aged-care sector recover. If this government were serious about fixing the aged-care crisis, then last night they would have put some money in to support these aged-care workers to get the dignity and support they deserve.
