        I would like to congratulate some of Bonner's up and coming sports stars who will be able to compete nationally and internationally thanks to the Morrison government's Local Sporting Champions grants. Successful round 3 grant recipients were announced recently. We certainly have some diverse young sporting stars who are at the top of their field. In total 11 young people have received a grant to help pay for travel, accommodation and expenses to compete in sports varying from swimming, touch football, softball, basketball, athletics and even sailing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to catch up with one of our local recipients recently, Lily Bassingthwaighte of Carindale, who will use the grant to compete in the Australian under 12s cricket championships in Adelaide. Lily said attending the championships was a great opportunity for her to play against the best girls in the country. And she hoped it would help improve her skills as she works towards her goal of representing Australia one day. Lily said competing against the best teaches young athletes to perform better under pressure and brings out the best in them.
       </p>

        Other recipients in Bonner include Lily Bogomiagkoff, of

        of Lota. I wish you all every success in your sporting pursuits.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to mention all parents and carers of our young sporting stars who sacrifice their time and hard-earned money to help their kids pursue their sporting passion. You give up a lot to help our young athletes to get where they are now and your efforts should be commended.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very pleased to be part of a Morrison government committed to supporting our young athletes to compete at the highest levels in a sport they love. Well done and all the very best to you.
