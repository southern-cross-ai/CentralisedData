        Today, however, we reflect today on the 25th Anniversary of Australia's involvement in the First Gulf War.

        When Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the international community responded quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        That same day, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Security Council adopted Resolution 660 condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanding that Iraq unconditionally withdraw all forces in Kuwait.
       </p>
       <p>
        As it became clear that the Iraqi forces had no intention of withdrawing from Kuwait, the international community unified and acted. Australia was quick to do its duty and join the global effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 1,800 Australian Defence personnel were deployed to the Gulf from August 1990 to September 1991. The force comprised units from the Army, Navy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF

       </p>
       <p>
        This conflict provided a number of 'firsts' for the

        It was the first time that Australia's Defence Forces went to war under arrangements where it was commanded by a Chief of Defence Force.

        The tanker HMAS
        <i>

        also made naval history by carrying into the war seven women—two of them officers—for the first time.
       </p>
       <p>
        By November 1990, the international community had lost patience with Iraq and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Resolution" rel="nofollow">
         UN Resolution
        </a>
        678 authorised the use of force if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by 15 February.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 4 December 1990, the Prime Minister informed the Australian parliament that the Naval Task Group would be made available to support the UN resolution. Committed to a combat role if necessary, the RAN Task Group was authorised to pass through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straits_of_Hormuz" rel="nofollow">
         Straits of Hormuz
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        That action saw Australian ships join the largest fleet of warships assembled anywhere since 1945.
       </p>
       <p>
        The multinational coalition force included some 90 warships, more than 100 logistic, amphibious and smaller craft, and 800 aircraft from 15 nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now firmly on a war footing, coalition ships faced the threat of Iraqi Silkworm anti-ship missiles and lethal drift mines.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 18 February two

        <i>
         Tripoli
        </i>
        detonated contact mines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Correspondent Terry O'Conner described eloquently the anxiety and tension which surrounded the threat of mines, heightened by the damage to the two US ships: 'Listening to the water washing the hull a few feet from my head as I lay in my bunk the other night I was acutely aware of the fact I was below the waterline toward the bow of a ship patrolling an area where mines were common.
       </p>
       <p>
        I found myself mentally reviewing the escape route, down a corridor, past a column, turn right then left, up a narrow hatch, a few metres to another ladder, turn right and onto the deck. I worked it out—at least a couple of minutes to reach the open air if I didn't get lost, if the hatches didn't jam, if the compartment wasn't flooded, if there wasn't a fire.'
       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        By the time the job was done in late April 1991, Royal Australian Navy divers had been involved, together with their American and British counterparts, in clearing four ports, searching two million square metres of sea bed, 32 wrecks, and dealing with 60 mines. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Navy" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        There were also individual members of the Royal Australian Navy who served at sea in coalition ships. Pilot Lieutenant Commander Peter Nelson, flying a

        </a>
        Air Force Cross for rescuing wounded British troops while both their and his helicopters were under fire. Army personnel took part in attachments to various British and American ground formations and Australia also provided military intelligence specialists who served in Saudi Arabia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the war, an estimated two million Kurds fled towards Iraq's northern borders. In response, in May 1991, Australia sent a 75-person Army team, including medical, dental, preventative medicine and field engineer teams. The teams worked in arduous conditions and operated on and treated hundreds of patients including many children. Australia later provided weapons inspectors in Iraq to monitor the discovery and disposal of prohibited nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.

       </p>
       <p>
        Most significant of all is that all of our service men and women arrived home safely—no Australian lives were lost in the First Gulf War. Our coalition partners did lose members of their armed forces and we remember them today. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        notes that there were 166 coalition losses. Members of the Kuwaiti armed forces died resisting the invasion and there was very large loss of life suffered by Iraq's armed forces and civilian population which is estimated to be in excess of 100,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a long period when the Australia's defence forces had not been engaged in warlike operations, our sailors, soldiers and airmen performed to the high standard that has earned them the ongoing respect and admiration of our allies. In doing so they did both themselves and all Australians proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anzac Centenary
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also keen to update the House on the significant domestic and international commemorations planned for 2016, and beyond. While we are all aware of the significance of the 100th anniversary last year of the Anzacs landing at Gallipoli in 1915, this year represents the 100th anniversary of Australia's entry into battle and the horror of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
         Western Front
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We mark one hundred years since the Australian 5th Division, took part in a disastrous and abortive diversionary attack north of the Somme at Fromelles, suffering more than 5,000 casualties in little more than 24 hours. It is difficult to imagine that it is one hundred years since the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions joined the Somme battle at Pozieres and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouquet_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Mouquet Farm
        </a>
        where in six weeks they suffered 23,000 casualties, over 7,000 of whom were killed in action or died of wounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2016 there are other significant anniversaries that helped shape Australia as a nation. It is 75 years since the start of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tobruk" rel="nofollow">
         Siege of Tobruk
        </a>
        which saw 3,800 Australian casualties. Ordered to hold Tobruk for eight weeks, the Australians held on for over five months, cementing the 'Rats' forever into Australian military folklore. The anniversary falls on 10 April and I urge all Australians to attend a commemorative ceremony in their local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also the 75th anniversary of the Greece and Crete campaign. It may not be well known that in 1941 the defence of Greece was largely in the hands of the Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        forces. This year is the 50th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Confrontation" rel="nofollow">
         Indonesian Confrontation
        </a>
        ; where 23 Australians died in a conflict largely hidden from public view. And 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of one of our most costly days in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        , where just over 100 Australian soldiers held off a force of nearly 2,000 enemies, with the loss of 18 men.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Anzac Centenary is our time to honour the service and sacrifice of our original Anzacs, and the generations of Australian service men and women who have defended our values and freedoms, in wars, conflicts and peace operations throughout a centenary of service. One of the most important legacies that can come from the Anzac Centenary is improved community understanding and awareness of our wartime history, particularly for younger Australians. The Anzac Centenary gives families, schools and communities an opportunity to start important conversations that continue long after the national program has concluded, and in doing so ensuring an enduring and unifying legacy for current and future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        One significant way we are doing this is through the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience. The travelling exhibition that has begun in Melbourne, showcases over 200 artefacts usually housed at the Australian War Memorial and will provide a unique opportunity for Australians to view their Anzac tradition.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit" rel="nofollow">
         The Spirit
        </a>
        of Anzac Centenary Experience is the flagship community event of the Anzac Centenary national program. It provides an opportunity for people in cities and regional Australia to mark the most significant commemorative period in our nation's history and I encourage all Australians to visit the exhibition. The exhibition will visit Adelaide next month, followed by Tamworth, Toowoomba and Brisbane. By the end of April 2017, the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience will have been staged in 23 locations around Australia.

        2016 overseas commemorations

       <p>
        Planning for the 2016 Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in Turkey and Villers-Bretonneux in France is well on track. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        is working closely with Turkish, French and New Zealand authorities to plan the events to ensure the health and well-being of those attending. The iconic dawn service at Gallipoli will be conducted as usual this year, and we expect to see large numbers of Australians and

         New Zealanders
        </a>
        traveling to attend the commemoration.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very keen to remind Australians that no ticket is required to attend the dawn services in Gallipoli and France in 2016. I encourage Australians to support Anzac Day in France, as I have outlined a hugely significant year for Australia's involvement in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        on the Western Front.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is 100 years since Australia entered the war in Europe at the Battles of Fromelles and Pozieres, where thousands of Australians made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. I encourage all Australians to attend a commemoration either in Australia or overseas this year to remember and reflect on their sacrifice. Applications are open for attendance passes to attend commemorative services at Fromelles on 19 July 2016, and at Pozieres on 23 July 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure safe attendance at the small memorial sites, the

        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        As in every war, Defence Force personnel leave behind husbands and wives, partners, children and friends for long periods of time, in challenging and dangerous environments. That is sacrifice enough. The efforts of our service personnel in the First Gulf War are emblematic of the service of those before them: our veterans of the First and

         in 1990 and 1991. In response to the ministerial statement today by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Dan Tehan MP, can I also congratulate him on his appointment to this important portfolio, together of course with the portfolio of Defence Materiel.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition, the government and all other members of parliament recognise the significance of commemorating the service and sacrifice of the men and women who serve in our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         . This anniversary comes at a time when we are commemorating a century, and more, of service and sacrifice by Australian service men and women in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has participated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nineteen years after Australian military forces withdrew from Vietnam, the Australian government committed forces to serve across the globe in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Gulf_War" rel="nofollow">
          First Gulf War
         </a>
         . The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August 1990 led to the formation of a multinational force, from some 30 countries, in order to enforce
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Security Council resolutions of the time. Over 1,800 Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed in the First Gulf War from August 1990 to September 1991. The force comprised elements from the Army, Navy and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         . In addition, some 75 Australian Defence Force personnel were subsequently deployed to Kurdistan,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Iraq" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Iraq
         </a>
         , on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Habitat" rel="nofollow">
          Operation Habitat
         </a>
         from 16 May to 30 June 1991 in the bloody aftermath of the war. The First Gulf War was an important event in Australia's military history which should be acknowledged for its significance, both diplomatically and strategically.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 2 August 1990 Iraq invaded its rival oil-exporting neighbour Kuwait. The invasion was widely condemned, and four days later the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         unanimously approved a trade embargo against Iraq. A blockade of Iraq's access to the sea followed within weeks, as the United States led and assembled a large multinational task force in the Persian Gulf, and brought follow-up forces into
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">
          Saudi Arabia
         </a>
         . At its peak the coalition forces in the First Gulf War numbered some 950,000 troops from some 30 countries; although, the United States remained the dominant partner in the coalition.
        </p>
        <p>
         In November 1990 the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Security Council set 15 January 1991 as the deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. Iraq failed to comply with that deadline, and as a consequence coalition forces began an air bombardment of Iraqi targets across both Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Within four days, coalition forces destroyed the Iraqi invading forces and drove the remnants out of Kuwait; although, the Iraqis retained significant military strength intact in Iraq, as subsequent events were to demonstrate. The air bombardment continued without respite until the war ended 43 days later.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 24 February 1991, after more than a month of air attacks, the coalition's ground forces moved against Iraqi positions in Kuwait and in Iraq itself. The magnitude and decisiveness of these strikes destroyed what was left of Iraq's capacity to resist. Remarkably, there were some 116,000 air sorties flown during this conflict. After two days of air strikes, Baghdad radio announced that Iraq's armed forces had been ordered to withdraw from Kuwait to the positions they had occupied before August 1990. Two days after this order was given, the coalition ceased hostilities and declared victory. Coalition losses amounted to 166 killed, many by friendly fire. At least 100,000 Iraqis had been killed in this conflict and another 71,000 were captured—a decisive defeat of Iraq's military.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia was one of the first nations to join the coalition force. Australian forces were deployed under the auspices of the United Nations. Three Australian warships conducted blockade operations in the Persian Gulf. Australia also provided a supply vessel, four medical teams and a mine clearance diving team that joined a protective screen, under

         In addition to naval units, Australian personnel took part on attachment to various British and American ground formations. A small group of

         . Four medical teams were also despatched at the request of the United States. Although the ships and their crews were in danger from mines and possible air attack, Australia's war was relatively uneventful and there were no casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the conclusion of hostilities, 75 Australian personnel were sent to northern Iraq to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid to Kurds living in the UN-declared exclusion zone, while ships of the Royal Australian Navy remained on station, at the request of the United States, to enforce UN sanctions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several Australian naval officers commanded the multinational interception force. Australia later provided weapons inspectors in Iraq to monitor the discovery and disposal of prohibited nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         On 19 July 1916, the Australians attacked at Fromelles, with disastrous results. The Australians suffered a shocking 5,500 casualties—our greatest losses in a single day. It was a harsh lesson about the scale and intensity of warfare on the Western Front. Four days later, Australians went into action on the Somme, attacking and capturing Pozieres. Under heavy bombardment, casualties grew in those first days and in subsequent weeks, eventually totalling some 23,000. Pozieres ridge 'is more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other place on earth'. Fighting continued on the Somme through the autumn mud and a bitterly cold winter. Australian casualties continued to mount and the men's health deteriorated in those conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every town in Australia has its own story and its own personal connection to the terrible events of the

          First World War
         </a>
         . Community participation is the way to ensure that the Anzac legacy is passed to the next generation. The Anzac Centenary Program continues to offer every Australian electorate the opportunity to commemorate the extraordinary sacrifice our Anzacs and the community as a whole made at the local level. We welcome the minister's update on the commemorations planned for the Anzac Centenary.

          Battle of Long Tan

        <p>
         Starting in the afternoon, the Battle of Long Tan was fought in a rubber plantation and lasted until the early morning of 19 August. Remarkably, the Australian forces were able to repel continuing enemy assaults and, in so doing, they inflicted very heavy losses on the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army. The use of armour and supporting artillery enabled that handful of men to defeat that much greater force and, in so doing, they protected the Australian base at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nui_Dat" rel="nofollow">
          Nui Dat
         </a>
         from what was intended by the enemy to be an overwhelming attack aimed at overrunning that base. It was, arguably, the most significant battle of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         for Australian forces. In that battle, 18 Australian soldiers died and a further 24 were wounded. I have had the privilege to tour that battlefield and be shown it by a veteran. It is a remarkable military accomplishment for this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deputy Speaker Mitchell, as you appreciate and as everyone in this place comprehends, the Vietnam War took a very heavy toll on our nation. As ever, the Australian soldiers serving in Vietnam upheld the very high standards of the Anzac tradition, and they remained faithful to one another and to their duty to their nation, a nation that had sent them into harm's way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we stop to mark the 25th anniversary of Australia's involvement in the First Gulf War. Our sailors, soldiers and airmen upheld the very high standards of the Anzac tradition, and did themselves and our nation proud. As we commemorate a century of service of Australian men and women, we reflect upon the Anzac values of mateship, courage, sacrifice, loyalty and resilience, and on how those values are upheld by members of the Australian Defence Force today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the minister for his update and I thank all those who have ensured, and who will continue to ensure, that our community appropriately reflects on its history and our future as a nation and the values that will take this country forward. I thank all those who have served and sacrificed for their country. I thank the House.
