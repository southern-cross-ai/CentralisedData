        I really want to wish the people of Petrie a merry Christmas. As you would know, Queenslanders from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_State" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine State
        </a>
        are a happy bunch. I think it's all the vitamin D we get up there! But we're blessed in the Petrie electorate with a wonderful outdoors climate, and we love to take advantage of that. Suburbs like Clontarf, Margate,

        coastline, and the rest of the suburbs enjoy cool sea breezes and treat the waterfront as an extended backyard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beach activities like swimming, kite surfing, lifesaving, boating, jet skiing, dragon boat racing, sandcastle building, whale watching or just picnicking bring the tourists in droves and, of course, generate much-needed business for

        s. It's a diverse, innovative and hardworking economy that takes advantage of the region's natural assets to bring positive outcomes to the greater community. The Morrison government announcements around the JobMaker hiring credit, boosts to apprenticeship subsidies, the instant asset write-off scheme and the all-important JobKeeper have helped shore up local jobs and businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The area is one of the fastest growing in the region, and with this comes increased pressure on infrastructure. The Morrison government has a very good working relationship with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the

         Moreton Bay Regional Council
        </a>
        and, combined with our federal funding, those councils have a strong record when it comes to delivering on time and on budget. Projects like Norris Road and Hoyland Street at Bracken Ridge are underway and will improve safety and traffic flow. I'm also looking forward to working with the Moreton Bay Council on different road projects in Griffin, Kippa-Ring and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Mango Hill
        </a>
        . The Queensland government has finally begun work on the Deception Bay overpass, and the federal government has contributed 80 per cent of that funding. That's going to be great for the residents of Deception Bay and the businesses up in that area.

        The Morrison government recognises the Petrie electorate is a tight-knit community and values volunteers. This year, there's been $70,000 in grants awarded to community volunteers—

        I want to thank the community volunteers in my electorate: school P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs, sporting and recreation clubs, environment groups, church groups, Lions, scouts, guides,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        s, Quota and Zonta. Thank you to all of these different organisations for what you do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to say sorry to people in my electorate who have lost loved ones this year. Losing a loved one is very difficult. My uncle died in October this year, and it's very hard. Leading into Christmas, I just want you to know that I know that it's a tough year for you, particularly with the global pandemic, but life is about relationships, so make sure you spend time with loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that 2021 will be great for our nation. Coming out of the pandemic will be difficult, but I think that we're a great country. We'll continue to do well, and I'll continue to do my best as your MP.
