        I would like to make an announcement in relation to the highly regarded Cheryl Lane, and I think it is appropriate that honourable members resume their seats. I wish to advise the House that today Cheryl Lane, our Attendant Supervisor, is retiring. Cheryl has worked for the House since August 2001 and as supervisor since February 2005. She has managed the attendants service supporting this chamber, the Federation Chamber and committee rooms in providing messenger services across the department with military precision and good humour. While clapping is disorderly, I am sure the clapping we have just had was appropriate in this instance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cheryl, I am sure that all honourable members join me in wishing you sincerely a long and happy retirement and we would like to thank you profusely for your services above and beyond the call of duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honourable members: Hear, hear!

        <p>
         I join with you, Mr Speaker, in saying to Cheryl: thank you for everything that you have done for government members in your occupation as supervisor of the attendants, and I know that means your duties are not just here in this chamber but throughout
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . It is very appreciated by government members. I was gesturing before at the member for Chisholm because I have had such a rap for Cheryl from the member for Chisholm that I easily could give an hour-and-a-half address on the things that she has done in the role that she performs, but I do not know whether or not that hour-and-a-half address is appropriate at this stage, Mr Speaker. But I do want to say a very big thankyou from us to you, Cheryl, and we wish you all the best in your retirement.

          I rise to join the Prime Minister in wishing Cheryl Lane a long and happy retirement and in thanking her for her long and dignified service to this parliament. It could well be said that those who love this parliament most are not necessarily those who are elected to it but those who work for it on a day-to-day basis and who ensure that the parliament functions with precision and with dignity. We can say with absolute confidence that in her many years working for this parliament Cheryl has certainly added to the dignity of the parliament and she has conducted herself with honour—at least as much honour as the rest of us can manage. We should appropriately acknowledge those who enable us to do our work. Cheryl, you have been a fine servant of this parliament in this country.

           On behalf of the broader federal parliamentary Labor Party—in particular those of us who sit up the back here—who on a very regular basis find reason to express our appreciation more generally to those people who keep this place running, on this occasion I would particularly like to express our appreciation to Cheryl. She will be sadly missed. She is highly regarded and respected. She does a wonderful job.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to remind members that last year Cheryl and her partner, Kay, were involved in a very serious motor accident and as a result of that Kay has not returned to work. I have no doubt that Cheryl and Kay will now, in retirement, have an opportunity to spend some more quality time together.

            I also offer my support for what has already been said in relation to Cheryl's outstanding service.

             Can I
            </a>
            reflect just a little. We see people around this chamber in their green jackets providing a whole range of services for us, which we greatly appreciate. But often we do not realise what the backgrounds of these people are. Cheryl served in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Australian Navy
            </a>
            for 15 years from 1972 till 1987. She reached the rank of chief petty officer. She became a defence civilian after her military service from 1987 to 1993 and was awarded the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff's personal commendation in 1991 for her work in setting up a call centre for family and friends for service personnel involved in Australia's contribution to the 1991
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" rel="nofollow">
             Gulf War
            </a>
            . So there is a story behind the story there which I think we need to reflect. She had an outstanding service prior to her coming to this place, and that additional 11 years here has been, I think, a wonderful contribution and a great service to this parliament and to the people who sit in it.

             Mr Speaker, on indulgence: as Leader of the House, I would like to associate myself with the comments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the whips and you, Mr Speaker, in thanking Cheryl for all the assistance that she has given. I think the spirit in which this discussion is taking place is a sign by which each and every member of the House of Representatives acknowledges the assistance that we get without question. We often impose sitting timetables that shift around, which the attendants and the staff of the parliament do not have any control over. I have been in this place for 16 years tomorrow. I always remember the date because it is my birthday. During my entire 16 years here, we have had extraordinary support from the staff of the parliament. Cheryl is always happy to do whatever is requested of her, and I wish her and her partner very well in their retirement.

               Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I would like to wish Cheryl all of the best for her retirement because she is a gold-plated member of the constituency of the Hume electorate. One of the things that I first learnt when I came into this place in 1998 was the wonderful calibre of the people here who serve us, the politicians. I know I can speak for both sides of the House about the wonderful contribution that Cheryl has made to her country in many, many ways. She must have had an enormous amount of tolerance to keep up that beautiful friendly smile of hers day in and day out. Well done, Cheryl. Good luck and thank you for making me look good by being one of the lovely people that lives in the electorate.

                Mr Speaker, on indulgence: if I could add my thanks to Cheryl for the work that she has done. On behalf of the cross-benchers, could I say that she has been an outstanding individual and a great representative. I was just saying to her at the door before this discussion began that we are very lucky in this parliament to have people of the calibre that we do have here. We have all recognised that today. But I think we have to really ensure that we maintain that calibre and that appreciation of the people who work within this building. I have been in two parliaments and the member for Hume has been in two as well. I have seen the loss of esteem of the people who actually work within one building. We have it here and it will be up to the members of this chamber and those who administer it to make sure that those people are shown the appreciation they absolutely deserve. Cheryl is an outstanding example of the calibre of people that we have within this building.
