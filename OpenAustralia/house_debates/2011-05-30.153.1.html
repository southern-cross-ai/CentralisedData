        On 6 April 2011, Ipswich sadly lost Phillip Kevin Dwyer—known as Kev—a party stalwart, a loyal unionist and a strong civic leader. Kev was born on a small farm at Peak Crossing, south of Ipswich, on 5 May 1927. From these humble beginnings he went on to become an advocate for the rights of workers in the Ipswich community. During his 83 years, Kev led a varied and interesting life in which he played many roles within his family, his parish, his working life, his political life, his sport, his hobbies and his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to entering local politics he was involved in the union movement—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
         AMWU
        </a>
        . As an apprentice boilermaker he learnt that in order to improve things around the workplace he needed to get involved to make a difference. He went on to hold many positions in the AMWU: delegate convenor, state councillor and state organiser. He was always at

        </a>
        marches in Ipswich. He was a man of principle who impressed upon the workers the need to respect good working conditions and on more than one occasion he sent workers back who were on strike because he thought what they were doing was unreasonable. He valued the hard-won conditions of his era, including sick leave and long service leave, as privileges not to be abused or taken for granted. He said the greatest thing about working with the Metal Workers Union was helping people. It was important to him that he did the right thing by both employers and employees and he was respected for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parallel to this, he joined the

        </a>
        in the early 1950s and went on to hold several positions including branch president, campaign organiser, Labor alderman on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Mayor
        </a>
        of Ipswich, where he served with his good friend the Mayor of Ipswich, Des Freeman. When asked about his membership of the Australian Labor Party and his political activities Kev explained that it was consistent with his values because it was all about helping other people. In that era he saw such activity as the best way to achieve this. He committed his energies to working for the rights of others.

       <p>
        Australians are known as people who stand up for what is right, who give everyone a fair go. Kev was proud of his Irish heritage and their fighting spirit. During his life he embodied Australian traditions to the maximum with an Irish passion. Married to his longstanding wife, Clare—who supported him in all he did for Ipswich, the party and the union movement—they, along with their six children, lived at Woodend until his death. He was a devoted father, husband and grandfather. He was proud to have been educated in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Edmunds" rel="nofollow">
         St Edmunds
        </a>
        . He had a strong Catholic faith. He loved sport—cricket and rugby league—and was involved in many organisations and he coached for many years. He was a stalwart of many organisations including his beloved Ipswich United Services Bowls Club. Kev was a mentor, an example and a leader. Kev: we admired you, we respected you, we loved you. Many thanks on behalf of Ipswich.
