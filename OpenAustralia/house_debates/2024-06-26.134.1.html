       <p>
        Today I recognise the contribution of the churches, temples, mosques, and synagogues in my electorate. Let me begin with a simple observation that in my community these places of worship are epicentres of goodness and inclusiveness. No individual or group is perfect, but in these institutions of faith we get closest to our ideals of dignity for ourselves and compassion for others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Religion fosters a strong sense of community. It brings people together, creating a network of support and belonging. In my electorate the churches, mosques, temples and synagogues are not just places of worship; they are vibrant community centres where friendships are formed, where young people are mentored, where the elderly are respected and learned from, where new migrants are welcomed and where the vulnerable receive support. These are places where people come together for families' most joyous celebrations and life's most difficult moments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Religion also benefits our community by instilling and reinforcing morality and ethics. The teachings of various faiths encourage compassion, empathy and altruism. Religious morality is both the historical source of our modern legal framework as well as a complementary contemporary guide for moral choices that sit beyond the scope of laws. Religious principles play a crucial role in moulding the moral framework of any community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Religion also promotes individual physical and psychological wellbeing. It offers answers to some of life's most profound questions, gives meaning to personal and communal experiences and aids individuals in their journeys of personal growth. Spiritual guidance and regular committed religious observance and activity has been shown to lead to greater psychological wellbeing and resilience, enabling individuals to better cope with the challenges of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Religion is also a major source of community service and philanthropy. Research consistently shows us that the more actively religious someone is, the greater their individual charitable activity and generosity. In Parramatta religious organisations are at the forefront of charitable activities. Religious organisations provide care for the young, support to the elderly, food for the hungry and housing to those in need. These acts of charity and volunteerism not only address immediate needs but also build stronger communities. During COVID, communities of faith supported thousands with food, comfort and company.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, religion enriches cultural identity and diversity. We treasure our multiculturalism in this country, and the truth is that the link between culture and faith is strong. Each faith brings with it unique traditions, festivals and rituals that enhance the national cultural tapestry. These cultural expressions foster a greater understanding and appreciation of our diverse world, promoting peaceful coexistence.
       </p>
       <p>
        In these ways religion delivers positive benefits to our community, and the purpose of stating these benefits is not to ignore the positive contribution of secular institutions and individuals, nor to claim that religious institutions are flawless. Rather, my purpose is simply to recognise that institutions of worship are one of the most important sources of social capital in our community. What flows from that recognition is a concern that religious freedom and religious conscience be protected and an imperative that we create a positive space for public morality based on religious beliefs to be advocated for in the public domain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Governments have an important role to protect religious freedom and support religious communities and associations. First, governments should provide support to religious schools. Millions of Australian parents choose religious schools in part because they value the moral framework the school creates. Governments can support these school by providing financial support, and by protecting their autonomy to build authentic communities of faith they can operate out of their religious doctrine and ethos. Second, governments can support religious freedom in religious practice and expression, both corporate and individual. Religious leaders gathered in my electorate last month to express their concern that the freedom of religion is being incrementally encroached upon by government legislation. Religious freedom should be absolute insofar as it relates to internal aspects of freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and any limitations of the right of people to manifest their beliefs and practice their faiths must be imposed only when necessary to protect public safety or to avoid a material and disproportionate infringement on the fundamental rights of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that religion should never be used as a wedge or a divider. It should be a unifier. Religion reminds us that our world is bigger than ourselves.
