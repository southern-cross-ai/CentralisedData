        Ovarian cancer is a really important disease. It is great that we have a chance to learn about it and to fundraise. One of the key speakers on the day was Dr Christopher Steer, a local cancer specialist. He spoke about the importance of clinical trials in deciding what the best treatment is. His group conducts world-class research in Albury-Wodonga. This research has been given a huge boost by the donation of over $180,000 raised by this local cancer group for research over the next three years. Funds were also pledged by Elders Real Estate. Anna Speedie has booked to jump in their skydiving tandem. There were over 50 prizes donated for the raffle. So many thanks go to the businesses of Albury-Wodonga who did all this work. Also thanks go to the Wodonga Chamber of Commerce for their generous support.

        The Kelsey Watts Memorial Research Grant was launched on the day. Kelsey's mother, President Heather Watts, was there. It was fantastic to see. I thank everybody for their hard work.
