       <p>
        The people of regional and rural Australia have been abandoned by this government and by the National Party. As I often say, National Party choices hurt, and their choices hurt the people in the country time and time again. Whether it's the National Party's cuts to health care, or their cuts to education, or their cuts to penalty rates, or their cuts to pensions, the fact is: National Party MPs have, time and time again, come into this House and voted against the interests of regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Nationals' attacks on renewable energy and their inaction on climate change contribute to the increases in power prices. In

        , the National Party's sell-off of poles and wires is pushing up electricity prices at an alarming rate. It's these harsh National Party choices that are increasing the cost of living for those in the regions, and the reality is: times are always tougher when the National Party is in government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In contrast, Labor has always fought for the country, and we've always delivered for regional Australia, by investing in health care and schools; by building roads and infrastructure projects; by addressing inequality, a very important move; and by having a fairer tax systemâ€”unlike the Nationals, who, shamefully, support tax cuts for multimillionaires and big business. But not Labor: Labor stands up for the country. It's only Labor that delivers for the people of regional and rural Australia, because we have their back, and we will always support them.
