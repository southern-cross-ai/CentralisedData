        I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. I move government amendments (1) to (3) as circulated together:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 3, item 1, page 6 (lines 6 and 7), omit the item, substitute:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1 Subsection 51AE(2)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Repeal the subsection, substitute:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) If regulations prescribe an industry code (other than a code that relates to the industry of franchising), the industry code may prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 600 penalty units for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2A) If regulations prescribe an industry code that relates to the industry of franchising, the industry code may do the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) prescribe that the pecuniary penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code by a body corporate is the greatest of the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) $10,000,000;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) if the Court can determine the value of the benefit that the body corporate, and any body corporate related to the body corporate, has obtained directly or indirectly and that is reasonably attributable to the contravention—3 times the value of that benefit;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) if the Court cannot determine the value of that benefit—10% of the annual turnover of the body corporate during the period of 12 months ending at the end of the month in which the contravention occurred;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) prescribe that the pecuniary penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code by a person who is not a body corporate is $500,000;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) if the code does not prescribe a pecuniary penalty mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code—prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 600 penalty units for the contravention.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2B) An expression used paragraph (2A)(a) has the same meaning as in paragraph 76(1A)(b).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 3, item 2, page 6 (after line 14), at the end of the item, add:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) To avoid doubt, nothing in this Schedule affects the validity of regulations made under the

         Labor actually welcomes the government's change of mind on the amendments moved in relation to schedule 3. These go to recommendations that were made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         , when the parliamentary joint committee reviewed the operation of the penalty provisions within the franchising code and related instruments. It's worth retelling the submission of the ACCC to that inquiry. It made the point that its ability to seek civil pecuniary penalties and issue infringement notices was fundamental to the ACCC's enforcement toolkit. The lack of consequences for breaching the franchising codes was undermining the ACCC's ability to ensure code compliance. Where penalties were insufficient, the franchisors were likely to factor that into their egregious behaviour and just build that into the cost of doing business, or doing business unfairly, in respect of their franchisees. Where penalties were unavailable, there's no incentive for a franchisor to comply with the codes. The ACCC noted that the penalties currently available under franchising code were small in comparison to those that were available under the Australian Consumer Law.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendment that the minister brings before the House goes some way to addressing that anomaly, and we support it. Indeed we made it well-known at the second reading stage of this bill that, if the government didn't do this, we would be moving amendments here and in the other place to that effect. Labor will be supporting this amendment.
