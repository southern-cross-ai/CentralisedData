        In Cowan there are many schools doing great work with our children. In the suburb of Hocking, there is a new primary school named after the suburb. Hocking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        is led by the principal, Steven Dickson, and deputies, Steve Hardingham and Mark Pegoraro.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is only the second year of operation; however, the school has a strong focus on technology. This focus is clearly demonstrated by the fact that interactive whiteboards have been installed in every learning area and that the school successfully utilises a wireless network. Credit for this initiative should be allocated to Steven Dickson, his leadership team and the staff at Hocking Primary School.

        I know that the parents and students have a very high opinion of the school and, just last week, I attended an assembly where the high collective morale of the school community was on show. The assembly was the Motherâ€™s Day assembly and it was conducted by the two classes of preprimary students. As is the normal procedure in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        primary schools, many of the students who are aged around five and six years old have to speak in front of the whole school community as well as sing songs. This has been very good for the personal development of the young children and contributes strongly to their self-confidence. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the class teachers Julie Jackson and Jo Mitchell and their education assistants, Chantelle Watts and Sheila Cairns.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other speeches I have made I have consistently spoken of the importance of leadership and the examples shown to children by their parents. As part of my Junior Cowan Community Watch initiative, where I encourage greater community awareness and involvement, I presented membership certificates and badges to four students, Melissa Tran, Megan McLoughlin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Nicole Voskamp. Soon I will also present membership certificates and badges to Tyler Clement and Jade McLoughlin. I thank these six students for their interest in working with me to help build an even better community. It is my view that the interest shown in the community by these young students reflects favourably not only on their characters but on the way their parents have raised them and on the school leadership. I would also like to thank their teacher, Mr Grant Rielly, for his support of the Junior Cowan Community Watch.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that the school leadership, the teachers, the parents and the students are working together for a better community, and I am confident that a great suburb and a great school will only get better and better in the future. I would also acknowledge the parent volunteers of Hocking Primary School, led by the P&amp;C President, Laura Allison; Danielle Pickett, the Vice-President; Kelly Walker, the Secretary; and Janine Carter, the Treasurer; together with members Phil Mears, Desmond Lees, Karen Cappiello, Richard Termini, Chantel Mussard and Adriana Manera. I wish Hocking Primary School all the best for their future and I remain confident that their successes will continue.
