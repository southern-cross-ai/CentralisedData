         The Hunter

        is filled with so many amazing local businesses. Recently I was lucky enough to attend the 28th Hunter Region Business Excellence Awards at Cessnock Leagues Club to see a few of these exceptional businesses be recognised for the great work they do. Hunter Valley Flooring Xtra, who are based in Cessnock, took out the trades and industry category; McCaffrey's Estate in Pokolbin won the hospitality and tourism category; Bryan Hampton from Vintage Connections won the customer service award in the individual category for the wonderful work he does showing visitors the beautiful vineyards and wineries in the Hunter;

        It was a great night for business in the Hunter, and I can't wait to visit all these businesses to experience them for myself. Congratulations to all the winners. This long list of businesses goes to show that the Hunter electorate truly does have the best businesses in the whole of the Hunter and Newcastle region.
