       <p>
        One day in the lead-up to the 2011

        election, officials from Hunter New England Health paid me a visit to discuss the future planning needs for the region's acute hospitals. While it is clearly a matter for the state government, they came to see me as a key stakeholder. But they were also after some strategic advice.
       </p>
       <p>
        They came with a proposal to build a new, significant and modern hospital on the western side of Maitland, possibly between the townships of Lochinvar and Greta. The catch was that if they were to build this new, modern high-tech hospital they would propose downgrades, if not closure, of both Cessnock and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurri_Kurri" rel="nofollow">
         Kurri Kurri
        </a>
        hospitals—probably a downgrade of Cessnock and the closure of Kurri. I told them that it would take an enormous public consultation effort, but that maybe the community would accept the downgrades for a brand-new hospital less than 30 minutes away—particularly given the ageing nature of the existing hospitals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I heard nothing more for some time, but in the lead-up to the 2015 election, the Liberals promised they would build a new hospital. Further, they promised it would be built within the boundaries of the Maitland state electorate. That did not concern me; both Maitland and Cessnock
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
         LGA
        </a>
        s extend west of Maitland. Having won the election, though, I understand that Hunter New England Health could not find a block of dirt within the Maitland LGA. So, to my surprise, the government proposed to build the hospital in Metford, which is on the eastern side of Maitland.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have said it before, and I will say it again: over my dead body will the state government downgrade or close any existing hospitals in the Cessnock LGA to build a new hospital on the eastern side of Maitland. In any case, it is the wrong site for many reasons, including traffic problems and parking problems. The traffic in that area would be a nightmare.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story grows worse: in the state budget just this week, the New South Wales government allocated just $5 million to the project—$5 million for a new hospital! So, seven years after identifying the need for a new hospital, area health has not turned a sod of dirt, there is no money in the budget and, just as bad if not worse, investment in existing hospitals is being deferred, obviously because there is a new hospital proposal. It is a disgrace; it is a slap in the face for the people I represent in the area and the New South Wales government has to fix the problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have a quick shout out to Singleton Scouts. I joined them on Saturday for their 100th anniversary. A big shout out to

        , their oldest member, and, of course, to Angela, Kevin, Dana, Bianca and all those who are working so hard for the children who are part of the Singleton Scout Group.
