        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. How will the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts deliver for our defence personnel and members of the

         Department of Defence

        , and how does this compare to other approaches?

         I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his long contribution as a leading paediatrician in south-west Sydney. Over decades, he has literally been responsible for the delivery of thousands of babies, and, as a result of what happened in the Senate last night, the vast bulk of them will now receive a tax cut. As a result of what happened in the Senate last night, every member of the

          Australian Defence Force

          Department of Defence
         </a>
         and every person working in Australia's defence industry will now receive a tax cutâ€”from a civilian nurse working at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Holsworthy Barracks
         </a>
         near the member's electorate, who will receive a tax cut of almost $2,200, to an

         Base East Sale, who will receive a tax cut of $1,463. For that person, that is twice the tax cut that they would have received under the tax plan of those opposite. Indeed, across the entirety of the ADF, 85 per cent of personnel will be better off as a result of Labor's tax plans. In terms of the Department of Defence, 95 per cent of public servants will receive a bigger tax cut under our plan compared to what was offered by those opposite. When you consider that, last year, members of the Defence Force received their largest pay increase in more than a decade, the combination now for women and men serving in our Defence Force means they are more than $5,000 better off.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite have completely given up on helping Australians with the cost of living. They literally come in here and will talk about anything else, or they will come in and just make stuff up. But what they will not do is come to this place with a plan to improve the lives of Australians, because they no longer have a tax policy. Indeed, the shadow finance minister said this morning that they would need to go back to the drawing board.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

         suggest that she give the shadow minister for defence a call, because I'm sure that he can lend her an overhead projector. What we are left with over there is a Liberal tax shambles. This government is committed to making a practical difference, fighting on behalf of working Australians and fighting on behalf of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.
