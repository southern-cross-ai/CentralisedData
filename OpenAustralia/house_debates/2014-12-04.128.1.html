        Today I wish to honour someone that did not necessarily make headlines in the newspaper or stories on the nightly news, but someone who worked diligently and persistently to assist those in need in his local community. Someone who would always lend a hand to those in need and roll-up his sleeves to improve his community and indeed contribute to humanity. That person is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Dutton
        </a>
        . A loved husband, father and grandfather who sadly passed away suddenly a month and a half ago. I wish to pay tribute to the work that Alan has done in his communityâ€”and it is an immense contribution.

        While his children attended Black Forrest Primary School, he was the president of the governing council and was on the Parents and Friends Association. He worked for Baptist Care, Mission

        of Australia, lending his hand to those most vulnerable. He was a cricket coach for many years at the

        , giving back to the sport that he loved. His passion for refugees was immense, and he was part of the SIEVX group that worked hard to achieve a memorial, to be erected on the grounds of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        , to honour the men, women and children who drowned on their way to Australia. He also volunteered as a mentor, teaching English to a refugee family. He was on the board of the Schools Ministry Group and was instrumental in the early days of school chaplaincy in South Australia and Tasmania.

        He not only worked hard in his local community, but he contributed to the global effort to end suffering around the world. He was on the board of TEAR Australia and a member of the Mitcham Rotary Club. He also had an immense passion for young people, which was part of the chaplaincy work that he did. He also volunteered later as a volunteer mentor at a local primary school.

        His daughter Bek said the following about him:

       <p>
        The quote that comes to mind when I think of the way dad lived his life was summed up by Ghandi "Be the change you want to see in the world." He was someone who walked the talk and made a positive difference wherever he went.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having known Alan and his family for many years I can certainly concur with this comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alan's passing is a deeply sad occasion and I offer my condolences to his wife Bula, his children Rebeka, Andrew and Peter; also to his grandchildren Annabelle, Matilda, Noah and Agonda; and indeed to his family and friends. While Alan is no longer with us, his memory should be an inspiration to us all. That is to do whatever we can wherever we are to help those around us.
