        Today I have the sad task of confirming that the Yerriyong motor sports proposal, which could have been such a catalyst for our region by helping to reduce unemployment and increase business opportunity, has been withdrawn and that all possible avenues have been exhausted. It is a disappointing, stupid,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        -sighted result that a not-so-rare orchid became the major stumbling block; and it is of particular concern that the agitation of a very few individuals ultimately caused this outcome. Our region, our youth and our local economy are the losers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has been a seven-year journey for Motorcycling New South Wales. Every time they thought they had jumped a hurdle, another one was put in their way—from fake Indigenous artefacts taking six months to determine, to studies being presented after the closing date for submissions, to orchid study grant money seemingly coming from nowhere, to the possibility of finding foam contamination, which has been negated—it has all become too much for the team at Motorcycling New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        And who could blame them. The whole process is flawed. If we are to progress anytime soon in our region, then the environmental determinants need to be consolidated and defined so that developers, businesses and employers have a set of rules to follow and will not be left to the whim of interpretation of legislation by those living in city environments, who really have little concept of how important projects like motorcycling complexes are for regions where there is inexplicably high unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Motorcycling New South Wales has invested well over $1 million in this. They had $11 million put aside for the build, and the federal government allocated a grant of $9.5 million—a total investment of $20 million. It is my understanding that the joint regional planning panel has asked that the project be withdrawn. I will of course seek every opportunity to have the federal government grant of $9.5 million reallocated to another project, or projects, in Gilmore.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cooke" rel="nofollow">
         Dave Cooke
        </a>
        , from Motorcycling New South Wales, the original long-term warriors of the project; Daniel Gatt and Christine Tickner; the local government reps and agencies who worked on the project; and the many individuals for their unrelenting support. In particular, I would like to thank business owners Norm Mogg for his almost daily request for updates and calls of support; Peter and Sonya Flannagan; Troy Creighton; Casey and Dean Lockeridge; Terese Macey-Mericham, Warren Mericham; Richard and Robyn Mahoney, from Better Tyres; and Peter Dryer. These people all knew how extensive the benefits would have been for our region and especially for our young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Yerriyong motorsports complex would have introduced a huge new income stream for our area. It would have created jobs and economic investment, including new hotels, tourism and other business opportunities. I am deeply saddened by the outcome. It makes absolutely no sense. I have heard that there are a few people in our community who have popped the champagne corks in celebration that this project has now been lost from our region. I wonder if they aware that they have stopped a great project—one that would have provided jobs, youth employment opportunities and economic growth. The flip side is that, when they email me or come to me about the lack of opportunity for our young people, and businesses closing, and say, 'What are you doing?' I will have no choice but to say, 'You started this lack of opportunity for our region. You did not see the vision of new apprenticeship opportunities, new engineering businesses coming to our region or the extensive accommodation and tourism boosts.' Shame on all of those who did not try to maximise the potential of this project for our region! There is no excuse for their lack of support. While a few individuals may walk that land in the right season and see this very unrare orchid, that is absolutely not going to equal the economic opportunity that has been lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dave Cooke has said that he would also like to thank the tireless efforts of our supporters in the area, those who worked closely with us on the project, as well as the locals who believe this project would be a win for the district and supported it—people like Dylan Jorgenson. Dylan wrote: 'I'm a local in Nowra. All I can say is please don't give up on this project. This is on everybody's lips in town. We want this. We need this. I own an electrical contracting company and employ 24 people, including seven apprentices. This area will thrive on the fruits of this facility, and even companies like mine who are not directly related to motorsport will reap rewards. Good luck. We're behind you 100%. Don't be beaten by a flower.'
       </p>
       <p>
        There can be nothing more demoralising than to face the decision to shut the door on a project you believe in, knowing that a region of high unemployment would have had the chance to remake its regional image, bring high quality and qualify jobs to expand the work and economic potential to include hospitality and tourism sectors and all the jobs that would bring. This is a very, very sad day indeed. It is regrettable that individuals and small action groups can get in the way of the majority of the people and it saddens me that this happens over and over again. It is time for the majority not to be so silent and to make a difference.
