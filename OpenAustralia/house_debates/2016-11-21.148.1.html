       <p>
        This morning I want to talk about communities—specifically, about acts of crime and how they can tear communities apart or bring them even closer together. Two weekends ago, I represented the Australian government at a local vigil for Manmeet Sharma, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Australian
        </a>
        who was murdered on Friday, 28 October. Mr Sharma was 29 years old. He moved to Australia about nine years ago on a student visa and became an Australian citizen. He was a part-time singer in Brisbane and would sing at weddings and other functions in his local community. He died after he was set alight at a Moorooka bus stop—he was a bus driver—in a horrific attack that shocked the community in Brisbane, right around Australia and in Mr Sharma's native India.
       </p>
       <p>
        I did not know Manmeet Sharma, but I know that a community is only as strong as its members, and he was part of a very strong local community. Australia is known as the land of opportunity, a safe country. We live in a great country, and this attracts great people—people who work hard because they appreciate the chance to make something of themselves. Not only did Manmeet grasp this opportunity; he shared it with others. I have heard of his generosity and compassion—that he would go out of his way to help an Indian newcomer find their feet here in Australia. This is commendable because in doing so, in helping fellow Indians come to Australia and build a new life here with their families, Manmeet became an ambassador.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vigil was attended by me as the federal member, by the state member for Sandgate and by Brisbane city councillor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Cooper" rel="nofollow">
         Amanda Cooper
        </a>
        . The council has donated $10,000 to Manmeet's family. Manmeet's death shocked the council and all the bus drivers throughout Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to mention Elly Warren, the young lady from Melbourne who was killed while travelling in Africa. It is alleged that she was raped and murdered in Mozambique, in south-east Africa, while on a driving trip. People in my electorate are sad when they hear what happened to Elly, Manmeet and other Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most important things for the Australian government is to protect its people at home. I note that, in relation to Manmeet, the Queensland state government has ordered an investigation regarding treatment provided to the accused murderer from public mental health services. We have a responsibility to make sure that people are rehabilitated whilst in prison, but we also have a responsibility to make sure that justice is served for people like Manmeet—and his family—when they are murdered, and we need to be making sure that the community is protected. State governments need to be ensuring that they legislate for this as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community is thinking of the friends and family of Manmeet and Elly at this time. They are in our thoughts and prayers.
