Minister, how do you respond to concerns that the new

        <p>
         I thank the member for Calare for his question. I acknowledge his concerns about mental health services in the central west as well as the concerns of people like Senator Bill Heffernan, who is regularly lobbying me on this subject. I can tell the honourable member that I have discussed these matters on a number of occasions with the New South Wales Central West Division of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Practice" rel="nofollow">
          General Practice
         </a>
         and particularly with Dr Ross Wilson, who I speak with regularly. My understanding is that the psychology service run by the division has, in fact, been re-funded. That is my understanding, but I will certainly double-check that and confirm the facts to the member.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me point out that as well as the new Medicare items announced today—again, thanks to the good offices of the parliamentary secretary, the member for Sturt—there is $52 million more to work with appropriate organisations such as divisions of general practice to provide mental health services in areas where there are few private doctors or private psychologists. I do believe that the new measures will help to develop a better private psychology market in areas such as the central west, but, as I said, there is $52 million more to help if that is not the case.
