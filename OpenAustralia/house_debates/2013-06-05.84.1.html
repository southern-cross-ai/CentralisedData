        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Financial Services and Superannuation. Will the minister outline the consistent approach the government is taking to deal with the human and economic costs of bullying in Australian workplaces? Minister, are there other policies on creating fairer workplaces and what would be their impact?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Deakin for his question. For the information of the House, the member for Deakin has been working with the Panlock family who are constituents in his electorate. Their daughter tragically took her own life after being bullied at work. So this is a very important issue to him.
        </p>
        <p>
         He believes—as I do and as this government does, and as I believe everyone in the House does—that everyone who goes to work should come home safe. There are no other sets of circumstances which would ever be supported.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Productivity Commission has estimated that bullying in the workplace costs somewhere between $6 billion and $36 billion. The Gillard government generally wants to address the economic and emotional cost of bullying in the workplace. I have worked with the Panlock family and others. There are no dollars possible to rate the cost of the loss of their daughter's life and the tragedy and the repercussions that continue on forever from that.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have provided the Fair Work Commission an extra $21.4 million over the next four years to help people who are bullied at work to get help quickly and affordably. I acknowledge that on 9 May those opposite said that they wanted to address workplace bullying. I quote from their policy:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Labor has promised to amend the Fair Work laws to include bullying.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coalition" rel="nofollow">
          The Coalition
         </a>
         will support Labor's proposed changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is good; a tick for that. The coalition said they would support the government's legislation which delivered a key recommendation of the parliament's bullying inquiry and which was an individual right of recourse for victims of workplace bullying. However, to my disappointment, I read in today's
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Financial Review
          </a>
         </i>
         on page 3 that the coalition apparently is going to move amendments and excise bullying provisions. I am sad to report to the House that the
         <i>
          Financial Review
         </i>
         has reported that the decision to move amendments to strike out tougher workplace bullying laws, which would see bullying complaints referred to the Fair Work Commission, is a surprise as the coalition's industrial relations policy document indicated support for the move.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I do hope here—and I mean this with all sincerity—is that there are some people opposite who just want to tackle the issue of workplace bullying. I believe that. I also understand that there is probably the pragmatic small-target brigade on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
          IR
         </a>
         within the opposition central ranks who probably want to silence some of the far-right-wing nutters who exist in the Liberal Party on IR. Either the
         <i>
          Financial Review
         </i>
         is lying or someone in the opposition is. Sorry, I withdraw that. That is unparliamentary.

            Speaker, on a point of order: the opposition takes mental health very seriously and I thought the minister did. Therefore, I would ask him to withdraw his slur against members of the opposition, making fun of people with mental illness.
