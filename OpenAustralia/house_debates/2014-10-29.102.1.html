        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government will contribute $1.5 billion towards the completion of the western section (Stage Two) of Melbourne's East West Link;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the commitment to Stage Two of the East West Link is in addition to the Commonwealth's $1.5 billion contribution towards the $6 to $8 billion

        (2) notes that the:
       </p>

        (b) East West Link will never happen under a Labor Government—State Labor opposes the project despite estimates that the cost of Melbourne's road congestion will grow to $5 billion per annum by 2021 and $7.2 billion by 2031, more than double current levels; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Victorian Leader of the Opposition has described the East West Link as a 'grand hoax' and has threatened to rip up any contracts that are signed with respect to the project and in doing so, has shown contempt for the people of Victoria.
