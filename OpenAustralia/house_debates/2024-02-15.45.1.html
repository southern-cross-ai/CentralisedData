        Tomorrow is a 41st anniversary of the

        bushfires, some of the deadliest bushfires in Australian history. It is a tragedy seared into the landscape and into the memories of Victorians and

        s. Ash Wednesday came about because of some of the driest conditions on record at the time. Seventy-five people died that day. Some were found having tried to escape these fast-moving bushfires, others defending their homes. Of the 75 people who died, 41 were Victorian

        I want to pay tribute to the five members of the

        Especially this week, with fires and storms raging across our beautiful state of Victoria, I want to pay tribute to all of our emergency services workers who put their lives on the line for us. I've talked before in this place about their bravery and their heroism. These average Australians rise to become heroes who protect us and protect our communities. To those who have left their families to serve today and to those who responded on Ash Wednesday, the members of Albanese government say thank you.
