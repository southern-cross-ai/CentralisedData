        I move:

         Customs Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009 [No. 2]

        is a complementary measure to the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4039" rel="nofollow">
         Excise Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009
        </a>
        , which I have already introduced and spoken to in more detail, and it shares an explanatory memorandum with that bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Customs Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009 [No. 2], which was rejected by the Senate on 18 March 2009 along with the other legislation, is also being re-introduced today in the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 thatimplement changes that are complementary to amendments contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments apply to imported alcoholic beverages not exceeding 10 per cent by volume of alcohol that are classified under several subheadings in schedule 3 to the customs tariff, as well as items in schedules 5 and 6.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments increase the excise equivalent component of the customs duty applying to those subheadings and items from $39.36 to $66.67 per litre of alcohol content on and from 27 April 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ad valorem component of customs duty for these goods, where applicable, has not been changed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Changes will also be made to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 so that imported beer is subject to the same definition of beer for taxation purposes as set out in the Excise Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009. Additionally, the Act will be changed to introduce a new taxation definition of grape-wine product. Changes to the definition of grape-wine product will also follow in the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Regulations 2000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. For the reasons I outlined when I spoke to the Excise Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009, I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate (on motion by
        <b>
         Mr Lindsay
        </b>
        ) adjourned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted for the resumption of the debate to be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.
