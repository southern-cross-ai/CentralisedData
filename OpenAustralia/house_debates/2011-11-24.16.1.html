        I present the report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Publications sitting in conference with the Senate Standing Committee on Publications. Copies have been placed on the table and I seek leave to move that the report be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the report be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        This morning concluded the last meeting of the joint Publications Committee meetings for the year. I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues who serve on that committee from both this House and the other place. Much of the committee's work goes unreported, other than the fact that the committee works very efficiently and effectively. As a consequence, not much is known or heard of about the Publications Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        As much as politicians would like to take responsibility for that, the staff of the committee do a fantastic job ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the committee in a way that delivers service to this place and the Senate. The staff, Mr Dennis Pecar, Ms Anna Gadzinski and Mr Matt Keele, have shown themselves to be thoroughly dedicated to their task and have demonstrated all their responsibilities in such a way that we should all be proud of their professionalism. Regularly when we talk about reports in this place we tend to actually talk about the substance and probably less about those who actually do contribute in such a real way to make these reports so effective. In the case of the Publications Committee I, together with my parliamentary colleagues serving on that committee, have not only faith but total admiration for the dedication and professionalism shown by the committee's secretariat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
