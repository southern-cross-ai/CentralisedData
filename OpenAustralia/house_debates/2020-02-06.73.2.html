        Adding to an answer I gave today to a question from the member for Eden-Monaro, and in the same vein as the previous question, I'm sure the member for Eden-Monaro would like to know that the

        government opened their program, which is funded by the federal government, in relation to small business recovery on 2 February 2020. Two hundred and nine expressions of interest had been received before the program opened and 68 applications have been received, with an average amount requested of $30,981 per grant.

In Queensland, there has been nil small business impact—this is my advice—with no grants program in place for Queensland at this point. The New South Wales loans opened on 3 February 2020, just a few days ago. That is also run by the New South Wales government. Queensland concessional loans opened on 3 February also, and guidelines are now being considered by South Australia and Victoria. I hope that information is helpful.
