       <p>
        Way back in April 2014, I was very pleased when our government announced more than $45 million for Bringing Renal Dialysis and Support Services Closer to Home project. There are increasing numbers of people with chronic kidney disease in regional WA and particularly across my electorate of

        </a>
        . It was important to expand these services to enable those suffering from kidney failure to receive treatment in their community, reducing the stress and expense of having long trips to Perth for lifesaving treatment and continually spending days away from home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I toured the newly opened Esperance Health Campus to see the last two renal dialysis chairs that we have installed. Esperance is a beautiful coastal community 700 kilometres from Perth, and travelling this distance to seek treatment is difficult and impacts on quality of life. The chairs have improved access to dialysis and renal support services, providing best-practice services to reduce, stabilise or delay end-stage kidney disease. The chairs were eagerly anticipated by the late Bruce Mihan, who passionately advocated for their installation. Bruce had experienced kidney disease himself and spent 18 months away from home seeking treatment and, ultimately, kidney replacement. On his return to Esperance, Bruce began advocating for the dialysis chairs so that others could stay in their own homes and communities while receiving treatment. It was my absolute delight to see the new renal unit open and chairs made available to that community. Bruce fought very hard for this renal service, and they are partly a legacy of his. I congratulate the Esperance Health Campus on their wonderful facility and honour Bruce's passion for his community.
