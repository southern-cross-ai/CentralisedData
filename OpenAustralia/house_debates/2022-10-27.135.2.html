       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I advised the Leader of the Opposition earlier today that I'd be making a short statement on indulgence to congratulate and send a shout-out to the Australian Wheelchair Rugby League team, which flew to London earlier this week to prepare for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League_World_Cup" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby League World Cup
        </a>
        . For the first time ever the tournament fixture includes the men's, women's and wheelchair teams, so we have the Kangaroos, the Jillaroos and the Wheelaroos. I think I that sends a very powerful message about equality and about inclusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members may be interested to know that, unlike Paralympic events, there are some players who live with disability while others in the team do not. It sees itself as a game for everyone. Craig Cannane started playing rugby league when he was 10 but stopped at age 19 when a motorbike accident left him a paraplegic. He assumed he would never play again. Next week will be his third World Cup and his first tournament wearing the green and gold alongside his son Corey. It will be the first time any father and son have competed at a World Cup. I want to wish Craig and Corey, captain Brad Grove, head coach
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Clark" rel="nofollow">

        and all the members of the Wheelaroos squad, as well as the Kangaroos and the Jillaroos, all the very best of luck.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand the Wheelaroos are taking on the Poms in their first game next Friday. I can't think of a better way to start a tournament than beating England in England. Representing your country on the world stage is a great honour. We know you will do Australia proud and that you will have the support of not just everyone in this chamber but all Australians.

        <p>
         I join with the Prime Minister in wishing the Wheelaroos all the very best. For all of us who are now searching for something to do on a Friday night or on a Sunday when the rugby league season is over, it would be nice to have a bit of content and a couple of games to be able to watch, to get us through, maybe just to string us through to the start of the next season.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have an incredible asset in our athletes in this country. It's a very significant part of our culture, of who we are. Regardless of what sport we're talking about, we have a lot to be proud of in this country. I want to recognise all of the players for the sacrifice they've made, but importantly all their families, who have contributed in a significant way to helping them through their lives with their disabilitiesâ€”in some cases disabilities acquired later in life. For all of them there is an incredible amount of respect and support across the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that in Brisbane, but across the country, there are different organisations that are dedicated to helping kids, juniors, who have a disability into sports of every type, and that is a great thing. There are kids volunteering to train, to provide mentorship, to coach, to make sure that they run the lines and be involved in providing that support and the moral support to help those kids enjoy sport as much as any other Australian child or young adult.
        </p>
        <p>
         I join with the Prime Minister in wishing our teams all the very best in the United Kingdom, and I'm absolutely certain they can do us proud and bring home a great deal of joy. We wish them every safe travel.
