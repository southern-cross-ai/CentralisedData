       <p>
        I rise to identify a trend which appears to be developing in the area of impairment assessment within the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I speak on behalf of a constituent who served with the armoured corps in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and subsequently with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Commonwealth_Occupation_Force" rel="nofollow">
         British Commonwealth Occupation Force
        </a>
        in Japan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The constituent is concerned about an apparent discrepancy in the allocation of impairment ratings. These are ratings which contribute to the allocation of the disability pension which is paid to veterans who did not serve in an operational area, or what is considered an operational area, and who do not receive a service pension but have suffered a service related illness or injury. As I understand it, after impairment ratings have been obtained for all accepted conditions, they must be combined to a single value, known as the combined impairment rating. A formula is then applied using what is known as the combined values chart. In this case, there seem to be inconsistencies in the assessment and reassessment of this veteran and, I am advised, also with others.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, in relation to two conditions, osteoarthritis of the left knee and lumbar spondylosis, this veteran was given an impairment rating of 30 points in December 2006. In March 2007 this was reassessed at 24 points. Given that the veteran is well over 80 years of age, it seems odd that impairments such as these would improve. His knees and back deteriorated over those six months to the point where he cannot walk without a walking stick. His back is so stiff that he can barely bend.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to another condition, under the heading of ‘skin disorders’, the veteran was given an impairment rating in June 1998 of five, in December 2006 a zero rating and in March 2007 a rating of five. What this means, of course, is that the overall impairment ratings still combine to keep him at 90 per cent of the general rate and short of the 100 per cent requirement for a gold card. Logically one assumes that, as one ages, impairments would increase, not decrease.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am further advised that this example is not isolated. Other veterans who are entitled to receive a disability pension have found that there appear to be inconsistencies in the assessment and then reassessment of their impairment ratings. This is a matter which should be further investigated. While I have not identified the constituent for privacy reasons, it is a matter I intend to raise with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. These people need to be sympathetically considered. They do not need to be considered in such a way that will disqualify them from what is their just entitlement.
