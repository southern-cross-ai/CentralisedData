        Fifteen August was an important day for Australians, as we commemorated the 75th anniversary of

        marked the end of that awful war Australians endured for almost six years. For the first time in our modern history as a nation Australia faced the threat of invasion. The bombing of Darwin and the midget submarine attack in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">

        brought the war into the cities and homes of Australians. This was no war in distant foreign lands; this was on our doorstep.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1939 to 1945, Australia played a significant role fighting in Europe and then the Japanese alongside our allied forces. They fought in places like Papua

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Milne Bay
        </a>
        , which was of such strategic significance. Fighting against a numerically superior and battle hardened force, Australia's young troops proved themselves to be highly effective, formidable and tenacious. Tragically over 17,000 Australians would lose their lives fighting the Japanese or in the horrific prisoner of war camps. I was proud to attend the North Sydney Cenotaph on VP Day to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of Australia at a moving service organised by the North Sydney

       </p>
       <p>
        Of the one million Australians who served in the war, there are just 12,000 who are still with us. But, whilst their numbers have dwindled, the importance of recognising their service has not, so it was an honour to meet some of the

        veterans who in live in my own electorate and present them with the special commemorative medallion struck by the Commonwealth to acknowledge the 75th anniversary of the end of the war. There were veterans like Allan Willoughby of Cammeray, who only turned 100 this month and who served in New Guinea. Allan is an amazing fellow and still lives in the home that he was born in—and six months ago he was still driving a car and doing his own shopping! Peter Comino, aged 94, of

        , also aged 97, of Greenwich, served in Merauke, also in Indonesia, and helped to defend the air base there from repeated Japanese attacks. Mr Scott later ran a newsagency here in Canberra, in Deakin, which is still there, and has fond memories of Prime Minister John Gorton picking up his newspapers when he couldn't wait for them to officially be delivered to the Lodge. Listening to their stories was an amazing experience and an opportunity for me to say thank you on behalf of our community. Our gratitude will endure for all times.
