        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his previous answer when he claimed that Mr Larry Summers had ‘come to this debate with absolutely impeccable credentials’ in relation to his view of Kyoto. Is the Prime Minister aware of Mr Summers’ argument put to a scientific conference last year that:

        Innate difference might explain why there are so few female scientists in high ranking academic positions.

          I will not enter the debate about the views that Mr Summers took as Harvard President in relation to the role of women in the academy. That was not what I was referring to, and the member for

            . He was a supporter of the Democratic side of politics. He certainly had a very good record as a fiscal conservative because during the period that the Clinton government was in office the American budget deficit was lower than it is now. He was generally regarded as highly competent in the job that he did. I don’t think time permits us to debate everything related to his views when he was at Harvard, but he certainly has very good credentials as far as the economy is concerned and as far as being very much on what I might call the progressive side of politics is concerned.
