        I want to speak today about how the Albanese Labor government is working with the Queensland government and local governments in Ipswich and the Somerset region to deliver results in critical areas of road infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is working with local councils to deliver critical road infrastructure, which will boost productivity, safety and reduce congestion. The 90 kilometres of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Valley_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Valley Highway
        </a>
        is receiving $46 million in safety upgrades, and that's being done right now as we speak.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday, I joined the mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Somerset Regional Council
        </a>
        , Graeme Lehmann, and councillors to announce a $5 million federal funding contribution towards the Fernvale South Productivity Link project through the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. This is resurfacing Muckerts Lane, and really converting McCulkins Lane into a Fernvale bypass. This is a terrific project which will support increased traffic volumes and heavier vehicles along existing roads. It will help reduce congestion and wear and tear on the road network by allowing heavy vehicles and other traffic to avoid major roads in the area, particularly the Brisbane Valley Highway. It will reduce travel time for commuters and connect Vernor with Fernvaleâ€”a real game changer for the people of that part of the Somerset region.
       </p>

        There are other high-priority projects in my electorate that need urgent attention and better connectivity across one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. The business case for the Mount Crosby Road interchange on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrego_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Warrego Highway
        </a>
        has been approved and is proceeding to the design stage, with construction expected to commence in late 2024, subject to funding. I urge the Queensland government to work with the Albanese government to lock in the necessary funding to get it shovel already and start work on this much needed upgrade as soon as possible, as 58,000 vehicles a day go through that interchange.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also look forward to the Queensland government's response on the Cunningham Highway Amberley/Willowbank interchange. It seems to me, on that particular project, the best way forward is to divert the highway south, via a bypass or a grade separation, and make sure only local traffic goes through the interchange to Willowbank, Rosewood and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        base at Amberley. There have been a number of fatal accidents at the interchange and along the highway in recent months, and I support the local community in their calls for a major upgrade of this notorious black spot and bottleneck. I urge the Queensland government to release the outcomes of its community consultation on design options for the interchange, together with further options, as soon as possible. This is absolutely critical for the people in this area, particularly the men and women who work on
