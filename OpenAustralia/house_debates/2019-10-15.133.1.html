       <p>
        In my electorate we have one of the most beautiful pieces of coastline in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . In fact, I would say it's the most beautiful piece of coastline. Touring our beaches and coastline is part of our community, and for local residents and families it's an endless source of free and accessible weekend activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most iconic and important parts of the coastline is in my home suburb of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallett_Cove" rel="nofollow">
         Hallett Cove
        </a>
        . It is a beautiful section of coastline and offers some of the best views you can get in metropolitan Adelaide—and, indeed, the best sunsets. But, more than that, it's one of the most geologically significant sites in Australia, as recognised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallett_Cove_Conservation_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hallett Cove Conservation Park
        </a>
        . One of the defining features of the Hallett Cove coastline is its accessibility through a lengthy boardwalk, which allows safe enjoyment of the coastline for local residents and visitors alike. The over-five-kilometre walk is incredibly popular and is enjoyed every weekend. It also attracts people from across the state. Whether it's to look at the geological sites, to take in the view or to see it as a fitness challenge, the boardwalk is always packed full of people every single weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, unfortunately the future of this boardwalk is under threat and now hangs in the balance. We need action from the local council and the state government. It's recently come to light that there are structural issues in some parts of the boardwalk. Rather than spend money to fix it, the local council is considering closing the boardwalk permanently.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reaction of local residents has been significant. There is deep, deep concern about and opposition to the permanent closure of the boardwalk. It's my view that we need to fight to keep this exciting, wonderful opportunity for local residents alive, and it's a view shared by many others. As Jonathan says, it's surely one of our region's most enjoyable activities. It's accessible; it's free. There are too few of these opportunities. We need to keep it. Alison says:

        We are so lucky to have this on our doorstep this cannot be closed.

        Everyone loves this boardwalk. I grew up fairly close by and used it every other week. Now I live a 40 minute drive away but it’s still one of my favourite walks in Adelaide and I take all visitors to Adelaide here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rima says:

        I love this walk and always tell people about this wonderful walk we are so proud we have it in Hallett Cove.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an incredibly important community asset, and it is now time for local residents to stand up and demand their voices be heard. It's time that the Marion council and state government worked together to save this boardwalk. It's more than money; its value is incredibly important. It's time for everyone to stand up, work together and save this iconic place.
