         I thank the member for Leichhardt for the opportunity to acknowledge his deep interest in the welfare of the men and women of the

         and for the opportunity to share with the House a little more information about the logistics of our withdrawal from Iraq. I also thank the Leader of the Opposition, who, during his earlier statement, confirmed what former Prime Minister Howard said this morning—that is, if the coalition had won the last election, our combat troops would be remaining in Iraq. This is now a stark difference between us and the opposition.

          I am about to clarify this point. The coalition seem confused. They agree on one hand that the job is done in southern Iraq but then argue that more needs to be done.

            <p>
             Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just making the point that the Leader of the Opposition said they would be retaining trainers in Iraq and that that would require force protection. Force protection comes from combat troops. I join the Prime Minister in acknowledging the fact that in recent years the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Defence Force
             </a>
             has been working hard in southern Iraq to ensure that we provide the Iraqi people with the security and stability they need to take control of their own destiny. Members of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Army
             </a>
             training team and the Overwatch Battle Group have now bedded down security in both
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Muthanna" rel="nofollow">
              Al Muthanna
             </a>
             province and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhi_Qar" rel="nofollow">
              Dhi Qar
             </a>
             province. At the same time, they have been training and building capacity within the Iraqi security forces, giving them the skills they need to enforce the rule of law in their own country.
            </p>
            <p>
             A ceremony to mark the completion of the mission was held yesterday at our base in Tallil. Importantly, the ceremony was attended by the governors of both Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces. Also there was the commander of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Iraqi Army
             </a>
             ’s 10th Division, the commanders of Multi-National Force Iraq and Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq and the commander of Multi-National Division (South-East). Dhi Qar becomes the second province handed over to Iraqi security forces, the first being Al Muthannna. Our soldiers have worked to ensure that the Iraqi people can look to their future with optimism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our forces are now well into the process of packing up the extensive infrastructure we have established in Iraq and they are beginning to return home. Indeed, some of them have already returned home. They will continue to withdraw in groups over the course of this month, culminating in an official welcome home ceremony in Brisbane on 28 June. I ask all Australians to keep them in mind. The extraction process is not one without risk.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Australian government remains committed to a secure and stable Iraq. Our frigate in the gulf will continue to protect the sea lanes and Iraq’s oil infrastructure. Our P3s will continue their surveillance work and our security detachment will continue to protect our diplomats and others in Baghdad. These elements, along with some headquarters logistics liaison staff, reflect our continued commitment to Iraq and to the Iraqi people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today I join with the Prime Minister and, I am sure, with all members of the House in paying tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I thank them for their commitment, dedication, courage and sacrifices. I also thank their families for their sacrifices and the anxiety they have lived with and suffered while their loved ones were away facing danger on a daily basis. We look forward to joining them on 28 June to welcome our troops home safely. All Australians can and should be proud of them.
