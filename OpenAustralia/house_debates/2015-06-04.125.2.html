        I want to start my contribution by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which this parliament gathers and paying my respects to their elders. I also wish on this occasion to pay my respects to the Wathaurong and the

        people, the traditional custodians of the land in which the boundaries of my electorate of Ballarat fall.

        Last weekend I had the great pleasure of being able to join in the celebrations of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        's Indigenous Round—though I hasten to add, to the relief of many on the field, not as a player—at a local footy match in Alfredton between the Ballarat Football and Netball Club and the Melton Football and Netball Club. I was honoured to be able to present the Aboriginal and

        flag to the Ballarat Football and Netball Club as part of the AFL Goldfields celebrations and the activities of the AFL Indigenous Round. The Indigenous Round is a terrific initiative that both honours and celebrates the great tradition of Aboriginal footballers, and it is fantastic to see it getting bigger each year, with more than 30 matches across the Ballarat region being involved in its activities, and it is the first time that I can remember—I am sure they will correct me if I am wrong—the

        being so actively engaged throughout.

       <p>
        As part of the celebrations, 30 Aboriginal flags were flown across Goldfields venues over the weekend—a tremendous gesture of acknowledgement and to pay respects to the traditional owners. I was privileged to be able to provide these flags to mark such an occasion. Plaques to each club representative were presented at a special luncheon representing the traditional owners. It is important that we celebrate the wonderful contribution that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander footballers have made to our national code. From the first Indigenous AFL player

While the round is significant in that it celebrates Indigenous pride, it also gives us an opportunity as a nation to declare that racism has no place in our society, no place in our workplaces, no place on our sporting fields and no place in our parliament. It certainly has no place in football.

        I want to thank the Ballarat Football and Netball Club for hosting me on Saturday. I especially want to mention Rod Ward, the Regional General Manager of AFL Goldfields; Aaron Nunn, the Operations Manager at Red Onion Creative, Ballarat Football and Netball Club; Melton Football and Netball Club; and all of my fantastic teams that participated in marking the Indigenous Round across the Ballarat region. Lastly, of course it would be absolutely remiss of me not to mention it: go mighty
