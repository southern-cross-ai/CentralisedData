        This evening I speak again about aircraft noise and the aviation white paper,
        <i>
         Flight path to the future
        </i>
        , released in December last year by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government

        , the Hon.

        </a>
        . Mr Speaker, as you know, I have raised on many occasions the concerns of my constituents about the impact of aircraft noise in Sydney’s inner west. The constituents of Lowe suffered for many years under the Howard government’s indifference to the effects of the aviation industry and activity at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Airport
        </a>
        . As I have mentioned previously in this House, and as you know, the Howard government sold Sydney Airport without any community consultation or real concern to properly and fairly address aircraft noise. Further, the Howard government concealed during the last federal election campaign its negotiations with Sydney Airport to close the east-west runway for upgrades. The people I represent were affected by the safety upgrade of the runway and I note that several constituents contacted me to convey their displeasure about the level of noise and the frequency of flights over their homes during the period of the closure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once elected, the Rudd government moved to immediately impose 22 stringent conditions on the project to minimise the impact on our communities. I am pleased to note that the east-west runway is now fully operational following the completion of the Runway End Safety Area project. All three runways are now compliant with international safety standards and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        must now ensure fair noise sharing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only yesterday I spoke with a constituent who lives in Drummoyne in my electorate who is very concerned about very noisy aircraft flying over her home up to 20 minutes before the expiration of the morning curfew. She expressed to me her concerns that the curfew was at risk. However, I was able to reassure her that the government has reaffirmed its commitment to maintain the existing curfew and the 80 movements per hour cap on flights. In fact, in May 2009, Jetstar was fined $148,500 for breaching the curfew at Sydney Airport for a flight that departed at 11.30 pm after its application for curfew dispensation was refused. Jetstar was the first Australian airline to be prosecuted and fined for breaching the curfew—and so it should have been. It is imperative that residents affected by aircraft noise are provided respite through the curfew. Noncompliance with the curfew by airlines, unless under exceptional circumstances, is unacceptable and the government remains committed to maintaining the existing curfew for the benefit of all communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further to the commitment to maintain the curfew and cap on flights, our government announced several measures to improve community consultation and planning in the aviation white paper.
        <i>
         Flight path to the future
        </i>
        is Australia’s first national aviation policy white paper and outlines the long-term framework for all aspects of aviation in Australia, including economic development, safety and security, future airport planning and sustainability. I applaud the minister for his vision and for undertaking the extensive consultation to develop the white paper. The white paper makes clear commitments to the millions of people using the airports and, very importantly, to the communities affected by aviation activity. Measures include establishing an aircraft noise ombudsman to improve the dissemination of information to affected communities and conduct an independent review of noise complaints handling. I note that my local community campaigned for an aircraft ombudsman and collected hundreds of signatures. I am extremely pleased that the minister is listening and responding to the calls of our constituents, and I certainly know he understands the issue because his electorate, like mine, is affected severely.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, the minister will phase out older and noisier aircraft flying over residential areas. In addition, the minister has outlined our government’s commitment to find a site for a second Sydney Airport to meet additional aviation capacity. The minister has established a planning task force with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government to identify strategies and locations for the second airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am heartened by available Airservices Australia reports that show a very gradual decline in aircraft noise over my electorate for the year to date. This is not to say that the current levels are acceptable—they are not acceptable. Indeed, I will be monitoring closely the reports of Airservices Australia, the reasons for any breaches of the curfew as well as the long-term operating plan targets for each month, to ensure we minimise the impact of aircraft noise on affected residents in my electorate of Lowe. Mr Speaker, as you know, my constituents have suffered enough.
