        On Friday I had the honour of attending the Musgrave Park Family Fun Day, part of

        Week celebrations. I was one of around 25,000 people who attended. It was a massive event with almost 200 stalls. I had the pleasure and privilege of listening to Uncle Des' welcome to country. I was really grateful to

        , Albert Bowie and the other organisers for inviting me along, and it was a particular privilege to meet Auntie Joan shortly after the opening festivities.

        The Nunukul Yuggera dancers were a fantastic traditional dance troupe. They informed me that they are soon to travel overseas to take their brand of dance international, which is a really great opportunity for some of the very young dancers in that troupe. I also saw more contemporary forms of art. A Wudjal Wudjal group had travelled all the way down to Brisbane to perform: the Cold Water Band are a wonderful reggae inspired group who have recently released an

        . I was also fortunate to meet other local and interstate Aboriginal and Islander performers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also really nice to catch up with the 2 Spirits program, a program from the Queensland
