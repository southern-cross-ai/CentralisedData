0Mr BALDWIN(Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources)(11.12 am)—I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:
      </p>
      <p pwmotiontext="moved">
       That this bill be now read a second time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am very pleased today to be introducing the
       <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/S571">
        Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007
       </a>
       , which implements the government’s commitment to substantially improve food regulation processes in Australia and New Zealand. The proposed amendments of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991, the act, have emanated from a number of different projects involving extensive consultations with all Australian state and territory governments, the New Zealand government, the food industry and consumer and public health groups, and I am delighted with the broad support for the proposed amendments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past 10 years the food regulatory environment in Australia has undergone a number of significant changes. In order to reflect this changing environment the legislation which governs food regulation has been amended on a number of occasions. The last amendments in 2001 were part of a reform package that restructured the food regulation system. It conferred policy responsibility for the food policy framework on the ministerial council comprising ministers representing all relevant portfolios, and it established a new independent statutory authority, Food Standards Australia and New Zealand, to develop and approve science-based food standards. The package also retained the requirement that the ministerial council be satisfied with any approved standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the commencement of the new system in 2002, ongoing feedback from consumers, government and industry has highlighted the number of areas where the authority’s operations could be improved. In particular, a recent review of the food standard development and approval processes highlighted areas in which processes should be streamlined and harmonised, red tape could be reduced and innovation in the food industry could be further encouraged. The underlying issue is that virtually all applications and proposals are being processed in the same way, regardless of whether these are for major or minor amendment to a standard or for a new standard altogether. Even applications for minor technical amendments are subject to the full gamut of two rounds of public consultation, three sets of reports and the opportunity for ministerial council review.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was found that the average time taken to complete a full assessment of an application was 16.8 months. This has led to a considerable backlog of applications. Anyone who lodges an application can expect to wait 15 to 18 months before assessment of the application could commence. To address this problem, the bill before us amends the act to enable the authority to assess different applications and proposals according to their nature and scope. Three different streams will replace the current one size fits all model, resulting in a targeted assessment process that will improve efficiency and reduce average assessment times. Improvements have also been included to better engage stakeholders in the standards development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another issue that was identified by the review was the need to improve the capacity to align the processes between the policy development undertaken by the ministerial council and the standard development process of the authority. The bill addresses this issue by further strengthening the complementary roles of the authority and the ministerial council. The bill enables the authority to suspend consideration of an application to await policy advice from the ministerial council when policy on the same issue as the application is under development. Currently, there is no simple way for the authority to defer dealing with an application to amend a standard, even if it knows that the ministerial council is concurrently developing policy guidelines that will affect this standard. This approach has been endorsed by the ministerial council. It strikes the necessary balance between aligning the functions of the ministerial council and the authority and processing applications without undue delay.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second change in relation to the ministerial council is to streamline the process for finalising standards. Subject to necessary changes to the food treaty between Australia and New Zealand, the bill amends the review procedure that is available to the ministerial council after the authority has approved the standard. The removal of the option for a second review will significantly streamline the process to finalise standards while still ensuring appropriate oversight of standards by the ministerial council.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a part of the review, a great deal of feedback was received on better management of issues related to food innovation. An area identified by industry as having the biggest potential for food innovation was that of health claims. As a result of extensive consultation with all interested parties, the bill addresses the main concerns of the industry by including a new process for the scientific pre-market assessment and approval of high-level health claims. The nutrition, health and related claims standard is currently under development by the authority. Once the standard is approved, individuals and companies will be required to make applications to the authority for pre-market approval of high-level health claims which will then be assessed against the standard and, if approved, added to the list of approved claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new process described in the bill ensures that if and when the new nutrition, health and related claims standard takes effect, all high-level health claims will be fully assessed by the authority, with the advice of an expert committee and in consultation with states, territories and New Zealand. Once the authority approves the inclusion of the claim in the standard, the amended standard will be considered by the ministerial council in the usual way. This process ensures proper assessment of the claim against the standard and also encourages innovation in this area by enabling claims to remain confidential.
      </p>
      <p>
       To remove unnecessary red tape and duplication and to improve clarity, the bill also makes several minor and consequential amendments. An example is an amendment to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994. The amendment enables the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to refer applications relating to maximum residue limits to the authority and for these to be dealt with in a streamlined manner. This will align the processes of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and the food authority for the cooperative setting of maximum residue limits and will remove unnecessary red tape and duplication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills reviewed the bill and made recommendations. In response to these recommendations, the government introduced three minor amendments to the bill. These amendments were adopted by the Senate. The state, territory and New Zealand governments have been closely involved in the development of this legislation. All are jointly committed to a food regulation system that runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible while still maintaining the existing open and publicly accountable arrangements that ensure the protection of public health and safety. This bill reflects this commitment. I commend this bill to the House.

        . Labor supports this bill and hopes that the significant changes to the process that are being introduced as a result of this bill will, as the parliamentary secretary has outlined, improve the processes for industry. We hope equally that they will provide some further protection for consumers, who also have found the previous process not only time consuming but also difficult to be involved in.
       </p>
       <p>
        No doubt it has been apparent to anybody listening to the parliamentary secretary’s speech that this is an area where there are a vast number of different ministerial councils, different advisory bodies and different regulatory bodies. The attempts in the bill to streamline these processes and make sure that they can work for industry are vitally important. There is even a new layer of complexity—it has been in existence for some time—added to our normal federal relations between the states and the Commonwealth to include New Zealand. The parliamentary secretary has noted that some of these provisions do not come into effect until the treaties that need to be amended between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        would be effected.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill has already been introduced and debated in the Senate. There was a Senate committee process in place, and I will talk through some of the recommendations that were made there. The bill that we are now debating in this place has the amendments that the government was prepared to accept. We had hoped that the government might accept amendments relating to public health issues that were recommended by the Senate committee. We regard this as a vital part of the whole regime that is in place. Given that the government was not prepared to accept those amendments in the other place, we will not be moving a separate amendment here, but we will be recording our disappointment that the recommendations of the Senate committee in relation to public health were not adopted by the government. We do accept however that this is an evolving process and that there will no doubt be many other occasions when we are all before this House making changes to this bill and that there will be opportunities to pursue those issues further down the track.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the record, this bill proposes to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Food Standards Australia New Zealand
        </a>
        Act 1991 in a number of ways. Firstly, it reforms the assessment and consultation process. The current one-size-fits-all model for assessing different applications and proposals by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSANZ" rel="nofollow">
         FSANZ
        </a>
        will be replaced by three different streams so that the applications and proposals can be assessed according to their nature and scope. Secondly, the bill contains amendments to strengthen the alignment of policy settings, processes of the ministerial council and the standard development and approval process of FSANZ. The bill enables FSANZ to suspend consideration of an application for up to 18 months where the council has notified FSANZ that it is developing a policy guideline on the same issue. Thirdly, subject to necessary changes to the food treaty between Australia and New Zealand, the bill streamlines the process for finalising standards, removing the option for a second review by the ministerial council after FSANZ has approved a standard. Fourthly, the bill introduces a new process for the scientific pre-market assessment and approval of high-level health claims. And finally, the bill makes several minor and consequential amendments to the act to reduce red tape and duplication and to improve clarity.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the explanatory memorandum and the comments of the parliamentary secretary, the purpose of the bill is to amend the act to expedite the development of food regulatory measures and to improve the framework within which FSANZ operates and food standards are made. We know that this is a particular area of concern to the industry. Australia does have a very strong and well developed food industry that finds the processes often difficult and slow, and it is welcome that the government is acting to try to improve that process.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is also an area where the public have become increasingly engaged in the health claims made about food, particularly relating to nutritional value. This debate is going to be ongoing and we know that FSANZ is already undertaking much work trying to come up with proper guidelines which will enable particular health and nutritional claims to be clearly set out for the public. So this will, I suspect, end up being important background for the range of other changes which it is almost inevitable will keep progressing through this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliamentary secretary noted that the government’s response in this bill has been as a result of lengthy consultations, a range of reviews, and feedback from consumers, government and industry highlighting a number of areas needing improvement in the framework for developing and assessing food standards by the authority. Some of this work goes back as far as 1991, when the National Food Authority was established and when the states and territories entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth. New Zealand became a partner in the Australian food regulatory system in 1996 and that was when ANZFSA was established.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        —agreed to a new food regulatory system in response to the recommendations of the food regulation review known as the Blair report. Obviously, since the establishment of that new independent statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand has been established to develop approved science based food standards. Policy responsibility for the regulatory framework has been conferred on the ministerial council, comprising ministers representing all relevant portfolios, and New Zealand again joined the system by way of treaty.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004, the Food Regulation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        , comprising senior officials from New Zealand, Australia and all state and territory governments, undertook a review of the regulatory system aimed at identifying opportunities for reducing delays in Australia’s food standards assessment and approval process and enhancing the protection of confidential commercial information. The government, as has been noted in previous speeches, advises that the issues addressed in the bill have been as a result of this vast array of different committees and reviews and these issues being the subject of consultation between the Commonwealth, the states and territory governments and New Zealand, as well as the food industry, consumer and public health groups and general members of the public. It is those assurances that lead us to be confident in our support for the bill, but, as I say, there are a range of issues that we had hoped the government might have been able to take further. The long gestation period for any of this legislation may well be a reason why changes later in the process are not necessarily welcomed by government, which I can understand. But I do think it will be important for us to keep an eye on developments as these provisions of the bill come into effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turning to the main provisions of the bill, schedule 1 introduces new application and proposal procedures to the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Act 1991. Schedule 1 also contains amendments to both the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act and the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Act 1991. Items 72 and 73 of the schedule amend the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act to enable better coordination of assessments for maximum residue limits and to provide for joint consultation by the authority and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority when that is relevant.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments in part 4 are amongst the most significant in the bill. Item 74 repeals the current procedures for amending food regulatory measures and developing new food regulatory measures, replacing them with new sections and divisions that reflect the new assessment pathways. The bill divides applications and proposals into different divisions for clarity and the new divisions deal with applications for the development of the variation of food regulatory measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        New division 1 of part 3 deals with those applications brought by business and individual persons, whereas the new division 2 deals with the applications that are brought and initiated by FSANZ as distinct from those that are brought by individuals and business. These processes represent two of the three new streams of assessing applications and proposals by FSANZ. I will come to the third new process for high-level health claims in a moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new division 3 of part 3 inserts four new sections concerning the capacity of the ministerial council to review applications, and changes the language slightly to accord with the new assessment processes. As the parliamentary secretary noted, this essentially retains the current operation of the act but the second ministerial council review stage in the process has been removed. Ideally, we hope that that will improve the speed of applications being processed without taking away the protections that obviously this regulatory framework is designed to ensure are in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new division 4 describes a process for urgent applications and makes sure that, after an urgent application has been considered, the authority still undertakes the full process in accordance with the general procedure. There are various provisions for time frames and other things. It is not necessary for me to go through those, as they have been recorded already in the explanatory memorandum. If, however, as the explanatory memorandum claims, the time frames—a maximum of nine months for the general procedure, a maximum of three months for minor variations and a maximum of nine months for certain variations to the nutrition health and related claim standards—are achievable, they will indeed be a considerable improvement on the time frames that industry has currently been working under.
       </p>
       <p>
        New section 109 also addresses the stop-the-clock provisions used by FSANZ and changes the instances where those provisions can come into effect. That will no doubt also be welcome. This provision was the subject of government amendment in the Senate, which I will come to shortly. Part 4 of schedule 1 also makes changes in relation to the rejection or abandonment of a proposal, public hearings being undertaken by FSANZ and the ability of FSANZ to utilise work undertaken by other government agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have outlined two of the three new streams for the application processes. Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the new assessment procedure for the third category, the high-level health claims; the third stream replacing the current one-size-fits-all approach. Under the new process each high-level health claim will be assessed by FSANZ with advice from an expert high-level health claims committee. The assessment will include a scientific pre-market assessment against substantiation requirements set out in the nutrition, health and related claims standard. States, territories and New Zealand will be consulted on these.
       </p>
       <p>
        New section 50 outlines the matters which FSANZ must be satisfied about before approving an application for a draft variation to the list of high-level health claims. These considerations include important issues like the protection of health and safety, the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices, the prevention of misleading conduct and the set of criteria set out in the nutrition health and related claim standards in relation to high-level claims. As I said at the outset, these are some of the issues that consumers are becoming, and rightly so, engaged in, wanting to ensure that claims on the packets of products they buy are accurate and able to be substantiated. We know now that there is a vast consumer movement for people who are worried about, for example, the childhood obesity crisis and are trying to make good choices for their children. The only way that can work is if claims that are made are actually able to be properly regulated and we can be sure that people are confidently relying on information that is accurate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there is a difference between those that are high-level health claims and other more general ones, and obviously there will be plenty of room for dispute, no doubt, in the coming years over that. But this is an important process. Enabling consumers to make informed choices is a very important criteria—certainly one that the Labor Party considers in assessing this bill, and it is part of our reason for supporting the government’s move. FSANZ must also take account of recommendations from the High-Level Health Claims Committee, any submissions received from the Food Regulation Standing Committee and any public submissions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Item 12 sets out mirror provisions for proposals in relation to those high-level claims. This stream was developed in response to an identified need to encourage industry innovation in the area. The explanatory memorandum argues that the new process will protect commercially valuable material during that assessment process, allowing applicants to capture the commercial benefit of their innovation—a view which of course is appropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I note here for the House that the food standard under which such high-level health claims will be permitted has not yet been finalised. Whilst we support the bill and the framework, including the introduction of the new process for the scientific pre-market assessment and approval of these high-level health claims, we do note our disappointment that the food standard for the assessment of high-level health claims is yet to be finalised. So we are getting some of the architecture in place, but the detail is yet to be finalised and negotiated. Labor calls for, as no doubt the government is also determined to achieve, the prompt finalisation of this standard so that the changes proposed in schedule 2 can commence, providing greater certainty for the industry. There is obviously also a clear public interest in the community in being able to have this resolved as quickly as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with Australia’s obligations under the Australia New Zealand Joint Food Standards Agreement, schedule 3 will not take effect unless and until amendments to reflect this new process have also been made to the agreement with New Zealand. Again, Labor calls on the government to promptly negotiate the requisite amendments to the agreement so that the amendments in schedule 3 may come into effect as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are the main provisions of the bill. I want to talk briefly in this place about the Senate committee process which has already been undertaken in the other place, but, as I have made clear, Labor does support this bill and the changes. We believe they do represent an effort to improve and streamline the process for assessing applications and proposals by FSANZ and we hope that the changes will improve the timeliness, as promised and, I am sure, anticipated by the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill was referred to a Senate committee at the end of March and the Standing Committee on Community Affairs conducted an inquiry. It received just 15 submissions relating to the bill and considered the bill at a public hearing in Canberra on 23 April. Submissions to the Senate inquiry highlighted a range of views concerning particular aspects of the bill. The AMA, for example, expressed disappointment that the bill seemed to place greater emphasis on improving processes for industry, reducing red tape and streamlining than it did on the public health implications of food regulation activities undertaken by FSANZ—a point that I have been making throughout my comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The AMA proposed the adoption of a clear definition of public health in the act and raised concerns in relation to changes to public consultation in some of the new assessment processes. As some people in the House may be aware—I will flag this later—we supported amendments in the Senate that were consistent with that recommendation by the AMA.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        committee in fact made recommendations about public health claims and the definition of public health that were not accepted by the government. Whilst we feel that this is a very important part of the act, we will not be moving that amendment again in this place given the government’s clear indication that they will not support such an amendment.
       </p>
       <p>
        CHOICE raised a series of concerns about changes in the bill which it felt impacted poorly on consumer interests and the transparency of FSANZ’s processes. CHOICE particularly highlighted concerns about the new processes for assessing high-level health claims, arguing that they compromised consultation and transparency, therefore undermining FSANZ’s integrity and primary objectives. CHOICE was concerned about changes to public consultation in some of the new assessment processes and concerned that limitations on the capacity of ministers to request a review would limit their ability to protect the interests of consumers. Like the AMA, CHOICE noted the lack of definition of public health in the act. CHOICE supported the new stop-the-clock provision, noting that it would be illogical for FSANZ to consider an application where the ministerial council had not yet finalised policy guidelines.
       </p>
       <p>
        In common with the AMA and CHOICE, the Public Health Association of Australia raised concerns in relation to changes to public consultation in some of the new assessment processes and again highlighted this issue in the lack of definition of public health. The Dietitians Association of Australia was critical of changes to public consultation in relation to new processes for assessing high-level health claims and called for more information concerning the establishment and membership of expert committees—an issue that is not provided for in the bill. I think that this is a concern the dietitians have had in relation to a number of other committees and that it is their view that their voice is not being adequately heard in some of these consultation processes. That is not a matter that can be fixed in the bill but it is a matter that we would like the government to consider in establishing the membership of these committees. The association also called for greater focus on the public health implications of food regulation activities.

        raised concerns that weaker measures in relation to food regulation could potentially lead to negative health outcomes for the public.

        and Grocery Council argued that the amendments provided a much more efficient approval process where it was appropriate and particularly supported the new high-level health claims process which, it argued, would address the significant free rider effect, making sure that those who were investing and being innovative were going to get the protection of this process. However, the council did raise concerns about the power of the ministerial council to amend standards and the lack of clarity in relation to the process for amending editorial notes. It suggested further amendments to ensure certainty for business. As I will flag, a number of these things were picked up by the Senate committee and then by the government in the other place and now form part of the bill that we are debating.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Beverages Council also raised concern around that lack of clarity and argued that the stop-the-clock provisions were unnecessary and inhibited innovation.

        , Monsanto and Dairy Australia similarly raised concerns about the stop-the-clock provision and some suggested further amendments that would ensure certainty for business.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs considered these submissions and raised a number of issues in their report, most of which I have touched upon. The committee made three majority recommendations, all of which Labor supports. The first—and unfortunately it is the one that the government did not see fit to support in the Senate—was that the Commonwealth consider clarifying the definition of public health in relation to the objectives of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 and the assessment of food standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you would have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, from my quick overview of the evidence provided to the Senate committee, a number of significant stakeholders shared Labor’s view that a definition would be helpful as part of the act. I record my disappointment that the government did not see fit to pick up that recommendation, which was, of course, made equally by its colleagues as ours. I would urge the government—we understand how the numbers in the House work and that that will not be successful here—to keep that as part of its consideration. As I say, a number of other things still have to happen for this bill to be fully effective. It may be that there will be an opportunity at a further point to define the precise parameters of public health. That would be something that we would strongly support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second recommendation that the committee made was that the definition of standard contained in proposed subsection 3(1) of the act be amended to clarify the process for amending editorial notes. Thirdly, the committee recommended that the stop-the-clock provisions contained in section 109 be amended to provide applicants with an option to proceed with the assessment process with the understanding that the approval might be rescinded or amended, if necessary, following any contrary policy decision by the ministerial council.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are pleased that the government did move on the last two of those three amendments, proposing amendments in the Senate which now form part of the bill we are debating to address the committee’s recommendations dealing with editorial notes and the stop-the-clock provisions. We support these amendments because we think it is always important that everyone is clear as to the intended meaning of legislators in regulatory regimes. We support the effort to clarify the use of editorial notes in this legislation and accept that the government’s amendment to the stop-the-clock provisions will provide greater flexibility, as required by industry. As I say, we are disappointed that the government did not adopt the third recommendation. We will continue to pursue that when we can in future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor is conscious that efforts to improve the processes for industry, reduce red tape, streamline assessments and provide greater protections for intellectual property must always be balanced with protecting the public health implications of food regulation activities undertaken by FSANZ. That is, after all, the purpose of regulating in this area. There will always be some tension, I think, in getting the balance right in those two things. I strongly believe that the movement in the community for much more consumer information and the campaigns for healthier eating and clear information about what we are eating mean that there will be a lot of pressure for there to be clear guidelines and a good assessment of high-level health claims as well as looking for an appropriate definition of what public health might mean.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I repeat that Labor support the bill and the amendments that I have noted. We believe that this package represents an effort by the government to improve and streamline processes for assessing applications and proposals. We urge the government to continue to take action in the areas where further treaty negotiation is required to ensure that this legislation will be fully effective. We hope that in future the government will consider some of our concerns in relation to consumers and public health claims. I commend the bill to the House.

         It makes eminently sound sense that there are common food standards across the Tasman. Your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Kerr, and I are members of the House of Representatives
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Standing Committee
         </a>
         on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and we recently brought down a report into harmonisation of laws within Australia and between
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         . It seems to me that, in 2007, it makes sense to treat the Australian states and New Zealand as entities which have a lot in common. The logic for having harmonised food standards is absolutely indisputable, just as, in my view, the argument for having harmonised laws in many other areas is eminently desirable. In fact, the committee recommended that there ought to be an ongoing, ever-closer sense of integration between the two countries, and it recommended a joint currency. We even looked at the possibility of a political union between Australia and New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I look at what is happening in the area of food standards, it is clear that, despite the fact that integration has not gone as far as I personally and, for that matter, as the committee would like to see, in 2007 governments across the Tasman and governments around Australia are aware that, regardless of where you go to buy your food and regardless of where you live, food standards ought to be uniform where possible.

          </a>
          New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007
         </a>
         facilitates the introduction of an improved process through which food authorities in Australia and New Zealand are able to develop common food regulatory measures and improve the system in which these food standards operate. It is a no-brainer to appreciate that the No. 1 aim of these regulations is to ensure that the health of residents, both within Australia and across the Tasman, is protected and, in particular, protected from conditions which may eventuate as a result of unacceptable and wrong handling of food items.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill modifies the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Food Standards Australia New Zealand
         </a>
         Act 1991, which established the food regulatory system of Australia and New Zealand. It has the following goals: to ensure high consumer confidence in the quality and safety of the food items that are produced in Australia and New Zealand, as well as those foods that are processed in either of the countries. The safety of food is something that we all take for granted. We do not really expect that, when we go into a supermarket to buy food, as we all do, we are going to buy something that is defective. I suppose we do not very often buy food that is defective because of the food standards arrangements within Australia and across the Tasman. We therefore assume that, when we buy something, it is safe to eat and certainly will not make us ill.
        </p>
        <p>
         To ensure this level of safety, there is a complete regime working behind the scenes.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Food" rel="nofollow">
          The Food
         </a>
         Standards Australia Act 1991 is one of the official instruments or, I suppose, legislative necessities which help bring this food safety to reality. Happily, it is not a regular occurrence, but occasionally there are still food items that are not safe to eat. The fact that that occurs indicates that this legislation is necessary. It is important to make sure that the food standards regulations and laws remain modern and up-to-date and that they keep up with the ongoing developments in food processing and production.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill and the act also aim to ensure that the objectives of a safe and effective regulatory system, as mentioned earlier, are able to be achieved, and that they are able to be achieved with confidence. While it is important that such a framework exists to ensure the quality and safety of food items, it is also vital that the regulatory framework supports the commercial sides of the production, distribution and, for that matter, sale of food items. On the other hand, it would be counterproductive to have a safety regime that is so difficult and rigid and impossible to adhere to that commercial viability suffers. So, as in so many other areas, this bill and the principal act seek to obtain an appropriate balance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The act also aims to ensure that there is enough information on food items so that consumers are able to make informed and intelligent decisions about their food purchases. Issues such as fat and sodium content, for example, are used by many consumers to make a choice amongst various food items available. The act also aims to establish common and consistent rules governing food production, processing and distribution to promote further efficiencies in the industry within Australia and between Australia and New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the system has proven to have many strengths, experiences of those operating within the system from 2002 have identified room for improvement, and that is why this bill contains a number of initiatives to improve the standards and the operation of the system. This bill reforms the assessment and consultation process; it harmonises as far as possible the processes for the assessment of applications and proposals; it allows for alignment of the policy setting process of the council and the standard development and approval process of Food Standards Australia New Zealand; it aligns the processes for setting maximum residue limits of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSANZ" rel="nofollow">
          FSANZ
         </a>
         ; it recognises the potential need to develop urgent standards due to unforeseen negative impacts on trade; it removes the ability of the council to request a second review while maintaining appropriate oversight of standards by the council—and this amendment is subject to changes to the food treaty between Australia and New Zealand; and it creates a process for expert scientific assessment of future high-level health claims. The later commencement of this provision allows time for finalisation of the Nutrition, Health and Related Claims Standard currently under development. As with so many other items of legislation, there are a number of other technical amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been wide consultation with stakeholders in relation to this legislation, which has received majority support—fairly strong support, in fact—from most of those stakeholders. I am pleased that the opposition has agreed to support this bill. This bill makes sound common sense and I am particularly pleased to be able to commend it to the chamber.

          . I would like to thank the member for Gellibrand and the member for Fisher for their contributions to this debate. Enough has been said in the introductory remarks of the bill and the comments by the speakers; however, let me say in summary that the bill introduces a risk-based standards assessment and consultation process that will make the system more efficient and effective. The bill aligns and harmonises standard development processes to eliminate unnecessary duplication and red tape, recognises the changing environment and creates processes to improve the management of issues in relation to food innovation.

          on Community Affairs and the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills reviewed the bill and made recommendations. In response to these recommendations, the government introduced three minor amendments to the bill. These amendments were adopted by the Senate. The state, territory and New Zealand governments have been closely involved in the development of this legislation. All parties are committed to a food regulation system that runs as smoothly and as efficiently as possible while maintaining the existing transparent and accountable arrangements. The bill demonstrates this government’s continued commitment to the protection of public health and safety. It improves upon the already robust regulatory arrangements that protect the safety of food for all Australians. Therefore, I commend the bill to the House.
