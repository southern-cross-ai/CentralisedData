       <p>
        Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to thank some of the many wonderful members of Young Labor for their passion, dedication and hard work over the last year. It's been a tough year for this side of politics but, through it all, we've always been able to count on the good people of Young Labor to turn up, make their voices heard and fight back.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the weeks and months prior to the election, I was overwhelmed with support from Young Labor members who came out every weekend and knocked on doors, who spent their evenings having conversations with locals, and who wanted to turn up and make a difference. I know that in my electorate of Cooper and across the country their work does make all the difference. Their conversations are powerful. Young people's passion and their commitment to the cause of progressive policy are powerful. I always will be grateful for their support in helping me campaign and connect with people in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Young Labor members are not just campaigners. They are vital sources of knowledge and have valuable connections to the communities around them. We as a party need to listen closely to what they have to say. They are the future of our party—of our country—and without them our movement would be lost. So today I say a huge thankyou to all members of Young Labor right around the country. We are indebted to you for all you do. I hope you know just how much your work matters. Don't forget that we need you and you are our future.
