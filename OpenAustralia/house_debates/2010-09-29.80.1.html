        I refer to the government’s claim prior to and during the election that asylum seekers will not be housed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">

        Base Scherger, nor would an immigration detention centre be built at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Scherger" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Scherger
        </a>
        . Now that the government has announced that RAAF Base Scherger will be used as a detention centre, how can anybody believe any promise made by this government?

         I thank the member for his question and obviously acknowledge that he would be concerned about this as a local member but I think we should be a little bit clear about the facts. What has been announced by the government is that the base he refers to will be used for short-term accommodation, while longer term options are investigated. The decision to make use of Scherger in that way was announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 17 September. I am sure he would also acknowledge that works were not in progress and steps were not being taken during the election campaign—that is simply not correct. I understand that the member would be concerned about circumstances in his local electorate. I am sure that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship will brief him, as a local member with such an interest, if he cares to get such a briefing.
