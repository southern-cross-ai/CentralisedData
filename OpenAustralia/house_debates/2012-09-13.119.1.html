        Today is R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ? Day. I want to encourage all parliamentarians to speak up and ask the important questions. Often we do not stop to think of the people around us and check that they are actually okay. I urge everyone to visit www.ruok.com and find out ways to join the movement by hosting events in the workplace, home or classroom, by spreading the message on social media or sharing your story.
       </p>
       <p>
        The R U OK? Day website states that connection, and open and honest conversations, are good for our wellbeing, whether or not we are struggling with a problem. It helps us to feel valued and supported by the people around us. There is also an emerging body of research which links supportive social relationships and a sense of social connection with protective factors in suicide prevention.
       </p>
       <p>
        I completely agree with this. In Hasluck, we have a large fly-in fly-out population. This has a major impact on the mental health needs of those who travel to mines and on the families left at home. I had one lady visit me in the office with an issue. After she discussed the issue, all it took for me to help was to ask, 'Are you okay?'
       </p>
       <p>
        We were then able to have a discussion around the issue she was facing at home and how she was feeling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tips on the R U OK? Day website include: just ask the question, listen without judgment, encourage action and then follow up with the person. Suicide is a major killer of men in Australia and people can make a difference by asking this simple question. Men are not often that great at talking about their feelings, but sometimes we just need that small intervention to make a huge difference. Lifeline can be contacted on 131114 and the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300659467 for immediate help. There is no shame in saying, 'I'm not okay,' and we urgently need to breakdown the stigma surrounding mental health and suicide.

        Last Friday, I was fortunate enough to listen to former ABC commentator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Glenn Mitchell
        </a>
        share his journey with depression and mental health issues. Glenn's story is an inspirational one and embodies the spirit of R U OK? Day. If his wife, Karen, had not persisted and asked the question, Glenn's life would have been very different today. Everyone came away from the event quite affected and inspired to make a difference in our own communities. I want to congratulate and thank co-founders Janina Nearn and the late Gavin Larkin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for commencing this initiative, and Janina for the hard work that she is doing as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        All Australians should get on board with R U OK? Day, and I urge all parliamentarians to support this life-changing initiative. I think that sometimes in this parliament of ours there are members who experience incredible challenges, as well as staff, and sometimes it would not hurt for us to take the time out to ask a colleague if they are okay, regardless of which political side they are on or which spectrum they are involved with. I think it is important that as human beings we take the time out to care for each other, to listen and to be receptive.
