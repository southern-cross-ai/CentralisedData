        I want to acknowledge the dedicated and selfless local Lindsay Australians who were acknowledged on the honours list on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        for their outstanding contributions to teaching, history, sport and medicine. Local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        Dr Harald Alexander Pope—affectionately known in Penrith as Dr Harry Pope—received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for improving the health and wellbeing outcomes of so many people in our community. Dr Pope has advocated for veterans as a medico-legal adviser lecturer at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Sydney
        </a>
        . He was chairman of the Macarthur Division of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Practice" rel="nofollow">
         General Practice
        </a>
        and a civilian doctor for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        . Across Western Sydney he has supervised medical centres and selflessly consulted five generations within one family. We've seen firsthand how important our health practitioners are, and this was never more evident than during the pandemic. Our community is richer for having Dr Pope, and I thank him for his wonderful service.

        Last year our community cheered on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Fox" rel="nofollow">
         Jessica Fox
        </a>
        . I've known Jessica since she was a young girl and I was so proud, as we all were, when she won gold and bronze at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Tokyo Olympics
        </a>
        . Having won over 16 medals at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICF" rel="nofollow">
         ICF
        </a>
        Canoe Slalom World Championships and as an eight-time world champion, she is the greatest individual paddler of all time. Jessica was awarded the Order of Australia medal for her contribution to sport, and watching her proud dad Richard on the night she won gold I can say that I know both Richard and her mum Myriam are so proud of Jessica. At just 27 years old, she has an incredibly bright and wonderful future and she is a true inspiration not only for my community but right across Australia. I took the Treasurer to meet Jessica recently, and I know he is incredibly proud of her too.

        </a>
        for his pioneering work in the education sector. He's been chairman of the new Anglican Schools Corporation. When Penrith Anglican College first began in 1997, there were 132 students and that grew to over 1,000 when he retired. Thank you, Barry, for your enormous contribution to education not only in our local community but across the state and internationally.
