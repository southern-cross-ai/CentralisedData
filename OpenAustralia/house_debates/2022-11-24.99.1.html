        My question is to the Minister for Government Services. In light of today's reports about previous contracting and tendering processes in Services Australia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , what is the Albanese Labor government doing to ensure federal government contracts are allocated in a proper manner that will ensure transparency for the Australian people?

         I rise on a point of order that goes to the proper content of the question. The minister can be asked about matters for which the minister is responsible in public administration but not about the practice of the previous government, which is expressly what this question went to.

           To the point of order: I don't know how this one could be out of order or how any of the questions asked by the opposition could ever be in order. This question refers to media reports of the day, which
           <i>
            Practice
           </i>
           specifically says can be referred to in questions, and then asked specifically about what actions the Albanese Labor government is taking. They are the terms of the question.

             have today reported that the member for Fadden used his status as a federal MP in 2017 and 2018 to help the lobbying and consulting firm Synergy 360 sign up corporate clients with the promise of helping them navigate the federal Public Service and political cycle and meet key decision-makers, including senior coalition ministers. Specifically, it was reported that emails revealed that Synergy 360 would frequently update corporate clients as to the progress in lobbying and provide access to senior government figures for the allocating and rewarding of several multimillion-dollar contracts. Mr David Milo is Synergy 360's

             </a>
             . A major shareholder of Synergy 360 is Mr John Margerison. Mr Margerison is a former business partner of the member for Fadden. Mr Margerison has also run the member for Fadden's political fundraising vehicle. The member for Fadden has previously been a director of a separate business of Mr Margerison. Strangely, though, a search of the federal lobbyist register reveals, however, that Synergy 360 is not a registered lobbyist.

                 The leaked emails reveal that Synergy 360 was lobbying corporations in relation to lucrative government contracts, including in the portfolios I am now responsible for; therefore, this morning I have asked the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                  CEO
                 </a>
                 of Services Australia and the CEO of the National Disability Insurance Agency to immediately and thoroughly investigate any of the contracts awarded to these companies and individuals named in these reports to assure me and the Australian people that the process was entirely above board and appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In conclusion, I want to say to Australians listening to this: the Albanese government believes the job of an MP is to work for their constituents, not their former business partners. Further, we believe when there is clear lobbying, as revealed by the emails, companies are required to be on the lobbyist register; this is not an option. But most importantly, using public office as a politician to enrich your private friends and mates, including political donors, is not a shade of grey. Whether you are a backbencher or a frontbencher is not an offence. If and when public office is being used to enrich private mates; it is corruption.
