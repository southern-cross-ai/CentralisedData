        My question is to the Minister for Skills and Training. What action is the Albanese Labor government taking through its responsible and practical budget to reduce cost-of-living pressures and to help give Australians the skills and training they need to harness the jobs and opportunities of the future? What has been the response to the government's plans?

         I thank the member for Paterson for her question. Recently, I was with her in her electorate, visiting

         Systems in Williamtown and meeting apprentices who are training to work on the F-35 program, which is so critical for our national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tuesday night's responsible and practical budget continues our work to rebuild and modernise our skills sector to give more Australians the opportunity to access well-paid secure employment—now and, of course, into the future—and to give businesses the skilled workers that they're absolutely crying out for. The skill measures include a $3.7 billion investment, upon striking an agreement with the state and territory governments, to ensure that we continue to increase places in the

         sector, with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         at its centre; $54 million to improve the completion rates of apprentices, something we really have to attend to; and investing over $400 million in foundation skills. One in five adults have real problems with literacy and numeracy, and we really need to attend to that very significant matter. On top of that, as the Prime Minister said, we have an additional 300,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places that will be delivered from 2024. That's on top of the 180,000 for this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fee-free TAFE has already been delivering effective and targeted cost-of-living relief for students, and I've been asked what the response has been to this government's plan. According to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, fee-free TAFE is wasteful spending. That is the view of the opposition—wasteful spending. I'm hoping that the opposition may change its mind on that. Given the fact that the deputy leader managed to speak in favour of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSA" rel="nofollow">

         bill but vote against it, maybe they'll flip on this as well. But I would not hold my breath!
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has a chance tonight. He could stand up tonight and say whether he supports students dealing with the cost-of-living pressures that they're enduring, whether he supports fee-free TAFE for hundreds and thousands of students or whether in fact he continues his position to oppose support for students that are really struggling to make ends meet. That's the opportunity he has, because if he chooses not to support this measure by the government then what that would mean is that, under a Liberal government, students in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

         who are training in manufacturing technology would be $5,750 worse off and those undertaking an early childhood education care diploma in Victoria would be $8,700 worse off. Students in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         training in building and construction would have to pay $10,600 more if this Leader of the Opposition were ever on this side of this House. The opposition has shown a failure to support government measures, including those that support students.
