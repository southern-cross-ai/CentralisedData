         I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. He knows that the budget is a plan for a stronger economy and an economy that has, under this government, delivered over a million jobs now around Australia. That was something that was a solemn pledge that the member for McMahon didn't believe could happen but it is one that we believed could happen, and we went to work and set about achieving it together with businesses, and Australians all around the country got out there and got those jobs. But we know that a stronger economy is essential to deliver on the essential services that Australians rely on. That's the guarantee for Medicare; that's guarantee for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
         </a>
         ; that's the guarantee for the pension. They are not guaranteed by the empty promises of the Leader of the Opposition. They are guaranteed by the strong economic management of a Turnbull government that has a plan for a strong economy that can deliver those essential services that Australians rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was pleased to join the member for Dunkley at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Frankston Hospital
         </a>
         with the Minister for Health, where we could meet with Ally and Georgia—her mum—who will benefit from the listing of SPINRAZA, which provides real hope for young Australians who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy. But it is not just Ally and Georgie who we are supporting; it is also the support we've given to Georgie Fyfe-Jamieson. Georgie is on a trial for Kisqali, a breast cancer drug being provided under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at a cost of just over $700 million. That is what you can do with a stronger economy; you can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
         But a strong economy is also about delivering necessary infrastructure. As the member for Dunkley knows, the electrification of the Baxter to Frankston line is going to be a big game changer for people who live in his electorate. It will mean that commuters can get to jobs. It will mean that patients can get to that hospital at Frankston on public transport, on the electrification of that line. I want to commend the member for Dunkley for his tireless advocacy in ensuring that this critical, congestion-busting infrastructure in Melbourne is being delivered by the Turnbull government. Also, we were there with the Seaford Senior Citizens Club when we were down at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_College" rel="nofollow">
          John Paul College
         </a>
         . We were talking about the commitments we're making for ageing Australians on the in-home aged-care places, 20,000, and the like. I'll tell you what they reminded us of when we there: just how much they resent the Labor Party for coming after their retirement savings. The Leader of the Opposition is looking to swipe the tax refunds of hardworking Australians. He's got his hands in their pockets and he'll never take them out of them.

            Mr Speaker, how can the Prime Minister answer a question about a complete hypothetical dressed up as a question about the budget? There is no question in the member Hotham's question because there is no such thing as the deal she talks about. And no-one has confirmed there's such a thing, so therefore the question is based in an entirely spurious, hypothetical manner.

             I will call the Manager of Opposition Business. If those sitting behind both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business could contain their interjections, I would be able to hear both of them. They're entitled to be heard in the roles they have and I can make a judgement. Just before I call the Manager of Opposition Business, I would point out one aspect of the Leader of the House's point of order, and that is his claim about the factual accuracy of questions. I'm not in a position to judge those, otherwise we'd be suspending while I considered each question, five minutes at a time.

             <p>
              Thanks, Mr Speaker. To the point of order: at no stage have the government disputed that this agreement exists. At no stage have they disputed that the document exists. The question goes to whether or not money has been appropriated within the budget to account for that agreement. You can't get anything, I think, more within the standing orders than that. The only agreement or document we're not allowed to ask about is a coalition agreement. If the government want to argue this one's a coalition agreement, then they're welcome to make that case.

                 Well, you should ignore the Leader of the House on these interjections. The point I was making was the connection to the budget. The member for Hotham can repeat her question.

                  Okay, I'll repeat the question. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. In its budget two weeks ago, did the government account for its secret deal with Senator Pauline Hanson?

                  <p>
                   No. That's out of order because it's referring to just a secret deal. It's not—

                   . The member for Hotham can resume her seat. The member for Hotham is expecting me, as Speaker, to draw a connection with earlier questions. I know what she's trying to do, but I'm not going to do that. The member for Dawson.
