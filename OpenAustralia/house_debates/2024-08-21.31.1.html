        In recent weeks over Territory skies

        was in full flight, with 21 nations, 140 aircraft and 4,000 crew. Unfortunately, an Italian pilot encountered some complications with his jet aircraft, but he ejected safely over the

        , were conducting patrolling not that far away, in Territory terms. They became aware of the pilot ejecting. He'd parachuted into heavy bush. The NORFORCE patrol responded quickly with a search-and-rescue mission. They navigated their way to the pilot using a combination of
