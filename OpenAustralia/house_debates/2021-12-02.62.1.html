       <p>
        Today I want to commend to the House the work of an inspiring school principal in my electorate, Louise Green, who is leaving Artarmon Public School at the end of this year. Louise has been the much admired principal at Artarmon Public School for 15 years. Throughout her 42 years with the Department of Education she has selflessly devoted her working life to providing high-quality and professional learning to the next generation of Australians. Among her many achievements, she has led Artarmon Public School through a major capital works programâ€”not an entirely enjoyable experience, but something that set up the school for success well into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over those 15 years the school's population has almost doubled, from 630 kids when she started to 1,276 today, and every one of those students has benefited from her driving ethos of what is best for the kids. In so many of those students there is now a little bit of Louise Green, and the inquisitive minds, care, compassion and talent are all her most important legacies. Louise is deeply respected by her colleagues, who describe her as a fantastic mentor. I know she also enjoys the respect and affection of parents. As the son of a primary school principal, I know that's not always an easy task.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Louise I say thank you and congratulations on a stellar career. It has been a pleasure to work with you during my time as a member for parliament, and you have my very best wishes for all that comes next.
       </p>
