       <p>
        As 2022 draws to a close I'm looking back on a huge year—huge for the people of my electorate of Corangamite and huge for the nation. I'm also looking forward with positivity and enthusiasm for what 2023 promises for the people of my electorate and the broader Geelong region. I am honoured and humbled that in May this year the people of Corangamite voted in the Albanese government, returning me as their local federal member. I will never take this for granted and I'm proud to say the Albanese government hasn't let people down. We haven't wasted a second of our first six months in power. We've delivered a responsible budget and returned stability and civility to parliament. We've brought milestone bills before parliament, including bills on secure jobs and better pay, the national antidiscrimination commission, climate change and respect at work.

        Less than one week ago Victorians also went to the polls, resoundingly returning the Andrews Labor government. Dan Andrews and his team have worked hard every day, removing level crossings and building hospitals, schools and roads across the state. In my area of Victoria, state Labor has a dynamic new team of Alison Marchant in Bellarine, with the retirement of

        State and federal Labor governments are therefore able to continue working hand in glove to deliver local projects across the region. This includes the Barwon Heads Road stage two upgrade, delivering an indoor aquatic centre in Drysdale and providing funds to many community and sporting clubs across Corangamite.

        coming to our region, a unified federal partnership has never been more important. The summer festive season is just around the corner. For my electorate it will bring an influx of visitors along the Surf Coast and the

        and Portarlington. We know how tough hospitality businesses have been doing it. We wish them well this summer. I'm confident it's about to change. We have a great country and a great government, and, as the year draws to a close, I take this opportunity to wish everyone in Corangamite—particularly those year 12 students who've finished their
