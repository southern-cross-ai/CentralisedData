        The Department of Health is proposing to fit-out new office accommodation and lab space at Fairbairn business park, Canberra Airport. The laboratory space will be used by the

        as part of Health and will provide contemporary specialist equipment to support the TGA's work. The office accommodation will be utilised by Health more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of works will include the office fit-out and integration of services into the base building works. The estimated cost of the works is $60.7 million, comprising $18.6 million for the office building and $42.1 million for the laboratory. The project was referred to the

The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence by April 2021, with occupation of the building scheduled for May 2022.

        Services Australia is proposing to fit out new office accommodation at 52-62 King William Street, Adelaide. Services Australia has assessed there is an ongoing requirement to maintain a presence in the Adelaide region to support the delivery of its business objectives and the government's commitment to service delivery. The new office accommodation will support the consolidation of Services Australia's five Adelaide sites, covering six leases in 2023, in accordance with the Commonwealth leasing strategy. The estimated cost of the works is $53 million, excluding
