        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year, under the Creative Australia Act 2023, Creative Australia was established as a modernised and expanded entity—a one-stop shop for arts investment, research and sector support at arm's length from the government. Two new parts of Creative Australia—Creative Workplaces and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Music Australia
        </a>
        —were also established to support Australian artists, arts workers and organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through its activities to date, Creative Workplaces is fostering positive collaboration between government, industry and the community, and is establishing itself as a central resource for promoting fair, safe and respectful workplaces within the sector. Music Australia has also provided direct support to the music industry through initiatives such as providing funding for 32 contemporary music projects as well as 33 international music projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this bill is to make the final amendments to Creative Australia which were announced in the government's cultural policy
        <i>
         Revive
        </i>
        . Having established Creative Workplaces and Music Australia, this bill establishes
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        Arts and Writing Australia within Creative Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Creative Workplaces and Music Australia started in August last year. First Nations Arts will start as soon as possible after 1 July this year following the passage of this legislation. Writing Australia will start on 1 July next year. The phased approach to implementation has allowed for a period of thorough, genuine consultation with both sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        First Nations Arts
       </p>
       <p>
        Extensive consultations were led by Creative Australia and were held with First Nations communities in 2023 and the beginning of 2024 and self-determined decision-making was seen as a priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        First Nations Arts will be established as a new part of Creative Australia, with specified responsibilities including supporting and promoting Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        arts practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will also establish the First Nations Board which, exercising a number of functions, will oversee the work of First Nations Arts. The board will consist of two co-chairs and eight other appointed members with relevant skills and experience. All board members will be Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples and the board will have autonomy over the allocation of funds for investment in First Nations arts.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Australia Council Board will have oversight of, and may give direction to, the First Nations Arts Board, it cannot give directions to the board in relation to the making of a decision, in a particular case, relating to the provision of financial assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government is committed to recognising and respecting the crucial place of First Nations stories at the centre of Australia's arts and culture. Consistent with this, it is intended that the legislation will enhance opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists, arts workers and organisations with funding decisions determined by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It will include funding for arts projects, developed and delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists, performers and companies within the prism of best practice cultural protocols and principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of this commitment, First Nations Arts will look towards a future with more sustainable career pathways for the arts to thrive, it will develop a First nations Creative Workforce Development Strategy, not only to enter the arts and cultural sector but to thrive in a sustainable career with enhanced professional and personal development opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of this diminishes the general responsibility of Creative Australia to be supporting the telling of all Australian stories, including First Nations stories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Writing Australia
       </p>
       <p>
        The government also recognises the importance of telling Australian stories through literature, while noting that our national reading rates are currently falling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Much like the music sector, new technologies are disrupting the landscape for writers, and modern approaches to supporting careers in literature need to be found. Writing Australia, to be established as a new part of Creative Australia through passage of this bill, will support and promote the Australian literature sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Writing Australia Council, chaired by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        of Creative Australia, will have eight appointed members with appropriate qualifications, knowledge, skills or experience to oversee the important work of Writing Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the government's intention that Writing Australia will become a hub for the sector, to build expertise and partnerships, to support writers and publishers. The Writing Australia Council will support this work and provide informed advice to the Australia Council Board about the responsibilities of Writing Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill continues the work begun by the Creative Australia Act 2023, which established Creative Workplaces and Music Australia, by establishing a further two new bodies: First Nations Arts and Writing Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is in line with the government's priorities, which are set out in Revive.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the bill also amends the Creative Australia Act 2023 by allowing the Chief Executive Officer to delegate the roles of chair of the Music Australia Council and the Writing Australia Council to a senior officer of Creative Australia or an Australia Council Board member.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill marks the completion of legislative changes to Creative Australia to enable the delivery of commitments under Revive. It is consistent with the government's strong commitment to our First Nations art and arts workers and to ensuring our literature sector is world class and sustainable.

        Debate adjourned.
