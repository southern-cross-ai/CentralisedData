        Last election, Gilmore changed and now includes

        . Recently, I had the opportunity to take part in a number of local events. Firstly, the opening of the Runnyford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">

        shed, which was unexpectedly very crowded, with many local and regional representatives attending the shed. It seemed as if it was in the middle of nowhere, but do not ever say that to a Runnyford resident!
       </p>
       <p>
        The Batemans Bay aquatic centre committee held a dry swim day, with races and activities on the rugby field, as they actually do not have an aquatic centre. The day was designed to raised community awareness of the benefits that will be available with an aquatic centre, apart from fitness and swimming squads. These include hydrotherapy, aqua aerobics, learn to swim for young children and water activities for residents with a disability. Carolyn Harding was the

        and ringmaster and was dressed fully in theme, with her swimming gear, spangled top hat and life ring. Many others came along with their flippers, snorkels and masks. Brad Rossiter, our famous local fundraiser—especially for kidney disease awareness—and I were rescued by members of the Broulee Surfers Surf Life Saving Club as we walked the 50-metre pool. Everyone helped to make this a great day, including the police, firemen,

        and ambulance teams who gave children rides on their drivers' seats.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the 50th commemoration of Long Tan day was incredible, with a choir from Vietnam, an amazing crowd of veterans and community supporters, and a great rendition of hymns and the national anthem by the Batemans Bay U3A Singers. Thank you to Juro Bjaniak, who gifted me his singing tie, which I proudly wear today.
