        I rise to commend the Victorian state member for Melton and the Victorian government, who recently committed $45 million to build a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        in Melton, in my electorate of Hawke and, indeed, in my good friend the member for Hunter's home town—where he grew up. Melton is one of Victoria's, if not Australia's, fastest growing suburbs, with a population forecast to grow to over 450,000 by 2051. With over half the population under the age of 35, the federal and state Labor governments are wasting no time in delivering the infrastructure and services the growing community needs. Road upgrades, school upgrades, new hospitals—there's plenty happening in our community. That's why it's so important that the Victorian Labor government will deliver a new TAFE campus in Melton with a focus on meeting the demand for construction skills training, amongst others. The new campus will support approximately 600 new students, with construction set to commence in 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those opposite like to claim that they are a party who believe that, in the words of the former prime minister and member for Cook, 'If you have a go, you get a go.' But the people of Melton have been having a red-hot go for the last decade, while the Liberals dudded them on physical and social infrastructure. The people of Melton and people right around our country know that it is only Labor governments that meaningfully invest in education, skills and training.

        Just this afternoon, the member for Longman, gentleman and scholar that he is—who, I may say, is the quintessential example of the Liberal Party being the place that very moderately successful business families send their dopey sons—made a rambling contribution to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill debate.

            Indeed. He suggested that those Australians who look to get ahead by doing an apprenticeship should be rewarded, and, despite his dopiness, I agree. However, what he failed to mention was that, by the end of the Liberal Party's time in government, there were 70,000 fewer apprenticeships and traineeships compared to when they first came to government in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            We on this side of the House are wasting no time in fixing this absolute mess left by the former government and in helping everyday Australians upskill with the skills and training that our economy needs. The Albanese Labor government is delivering 465,000 fee-free
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
             TAFE
            </a>
            places to help address skill shortages, starting with a $550 million contribution to a jointly funded 12-month skills agreement to support 180,000 places from January next year. On top of this, the government is investing $50 million through the TAFE Technology Fund to improve
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
             IT
            </a>
            facilities, workshops, laboratories and telehealth simulators across the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Albanese Labor government is also delivering the Australian Skills Guarantee, ensuring that one in 10 workers on major federally funded government projects are an apprentice, a trainee or a paid cadet. Such is the belief of this government in the role of public TAFE in our economy, we will ensure TAFE receives at least 70 per cent of Commonwealth vocational and educational funding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Public TAFE campuses are vital for communities like mine, and I'd like to bring the House's attention to a business in my home town of Ballan by way of demonstration. Tony and Edith Paarhammer started Paarhammer Windows and Doors in 1990 in a small rented garage. They took on their first apprentice just one year later. Now, after over 30 successful years, Paarhammer Windows and Doors is based out of a large 4,500 square metre factory in Ballan. They are one of the premier manufacturers of premium windows and doors in Australia. Incredibly, over those 30 years the Paarhammer business has trained more than 60 apprentices, passing on essential skills and experience. Tony and Edith understand the value of apprenticeships for business and for young workers, providing small and medium local business with the labour they need to grow and thrive while also providing the employment and trading our local economy relies on.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is clear that only Labor governments, whether it be state or federal, will ensure that our TAFE system is provided with the funding that it needs to help Australian workers, business and the economy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Minister Brendan O'Connor for his tireless work in cleaning up the mess left by those opposite, and local state member for Melton Steve McGhie for his role in delivering a TAFE for our community in Melton.
