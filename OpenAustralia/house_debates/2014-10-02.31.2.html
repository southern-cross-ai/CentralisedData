       <p>
        In Australia we know how to make multiculturalism work. We are a stronger, more prosperous nation because of our social diversity and we are a safer and more secure society because of our national unity. But Australian multiculturalism works because we work at it. When our communities face challenges that threaten to divide us and throw our community into conflict, we confront them and move forward together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the recent consideration of national security issues by this parliament has occurred in the context of a national fever dream of fear and paranoia about our Islamic community. In recent times we have seen sections of the media, both mainstream and social media, caught up in a hysteria about our Islamic community. We have also seen comments from members of this place, almost universally from members representing areas with very small Islamic communities, attacking the choice of some women in the Islamic community to wear the burqa, niqab or hijab.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a member representing an electorate with a very large Islamic community, I want to send a very clear message on this issue. No-one in Australia has anything to fear from the Islamic community. There are almost 500,000 Muslims in Australia. In contrast, there is a bare handful of perverted fanatics in this country who would seek to hijack this religion to commit criminal acts in its name. The member for Dawson can take it from me—one of the 118 members in this House with larger Islamic populations in their electorate that his—that he does not need to be scared of a burqa.
       </p>
       <p>
        The public statements of politicians and media reports relating to our Islamic community have real-world consequences. As we confront the threat of terrorism, we need to remember that our security relies on our unity. If we allow our community to be divided against ourselves, we will all be lost.
