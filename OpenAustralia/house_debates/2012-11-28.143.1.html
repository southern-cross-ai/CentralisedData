        On Friday evening I had the pleasure of joining more than 130 local business employees at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Evelyn
        </a>
        Chamber of Commerce business awards night. The number present was an indication of the vibrancy of the Mount Evelyn community and also the great work of their chamber of commerce, led by Kathie Freeman, Chris Monaghan and a very dedicated committee. There were a number of awards, and I want to pay tribute to all of those who were recognised last Friday evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The retailing excellence award was won by Rueben Nieuwesteeg of Billy Goat Hill Brasserie. The service excellence award was won by Adriana Matisorovic of H'diva Boutique Hair and Beauty. The industry achievement award was won by Kieran Cox, a barrister and solicitor, who has been in the Mount Evelyn area for more than 30 years. The community group of the year award was won by Mount Evelyn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The best home based business award was run by Mary and Anders Wiking of Yarra Ranges Country Apartments. The outstanding achievement award was won by Jodie Kimpton of Jobo Design. The best presented business award was won by Annette Bird of Shear Obsession hairdressing. The environmental award was won by the Mount Evelyn Environmental Protection and Progress Association. The youth development award was won by the Mount Evelyn Scout group and their irrepressible leader Gary Park. Finally, the Mount Evelyn Community Bank business of the year award was won by the team at the Professionals Real Estate in Mount Evelyn. I want to pay tribute to all those who were recognised and all those who make the chamber the great asset that it is to the local community.

        On Sunday I was pleased to attend the Lilydale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        open day—there were CFA open days right across Victoria. This was particularly special because it also saw the launch of their 125-year history project—a dedicated piece of work put together by those at the CFA and authored by Captain Robert Bethell, a long-time member of the CFA who has done all of the painstaking writing and work to put into print the history of the Lilydale CFA. I congratulate Robert Bethell and also Captain Warren Davis and retired Captain Frank Whelan.
