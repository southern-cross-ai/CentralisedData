        Last year I spoke here about important projects in my electorate the coalition government has committed to support. Today I would like to update the chamber about two projects that will boost sports and tourism in Brisbane's bayside area. I am pleased to report that work is progressing well at the

        clubhouse and the

        Discovery Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        My flagship commitment last year was to the Wynnum Manly Seagulls for a much-needed upgrade of their dressing rooms. The coalition pledged $400,000 in funding, which has since come through. The Wynnum Manly Seagulls football club

        , Hanan Laban, has told me the project is now ahead of schedule. This is excellent news for local football and sporting groups in the bayside area. Hanan was kind enough to give me a tour of the project site last year. He told me that football and sports groups of all ages use their dressing room facilities. The project will open up access to many more groups, including women's sports groups, thanks to the addition of female changing stalls and facilities. I am proud to have delivered for the Wynnum Manly Seagulls football club, a not-for-profit organisation that relies on community support to operate. The project will make the clubhouse a sporting hub for the community and bring more people to the bayside area. I cannot wait to be there for the grand opening next month.

        Another project that will attract more visitors to the bayside is the extension of the Moreton Bay Discovery Centre at Manly Harbour Village. The coalition has committed $450,000 to the centre to construct an extension that will house the Moreton Bay Discovery Museum. The deed of agreement for the project has now been signed, and work is expected to be finished by the end of the year. Chair of the Moreton Bay Discovery Centre Mr David Farley tells me the Moreton Bay Discovery Museum will house displays showcasing the natural, social and cultural history of Moreton Bay. It is a great addition to the Wynnum Manly Tourism &amp;

        and jetty cafe at William Gunn Jetty and will help attract more tourists to the area. I cannot wait to see these vital projects completed. I will continue to provide updates on these projects and others in my electorate as they progress.
