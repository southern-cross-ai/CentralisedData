         I thank the member for Durack for his question. We had a terrific couple of days up in the Pilbara earlier this year looking at the importance of the mining industry. It is terrific to have the new member for Durack, like the previous member for Durack, so committed to making the most out of Australia's mining industry and not committed to finding ways to injure it, like the former Treasurer the member for Lilley. While we were there, we committed, along with the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the funding went ahead for two very important projects in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Great Northern Highway
         </a>
         project and the North West Coastal project, two projects that were left unfunded by the Labor Party when we got to government. We know they were unfunded, because they were being paid for by the mining tax revenue.

         The member for Perth knows very well that this was a problem that they had left to the new government. We got to government, and the infrastructure Prime Minister said, 'This is unacceptable; these two projects must go ahead.' So we found a way to fund these projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that there was no money there because we referred to the oracle himself—the designer of the mining tax and the genius behind the tax that raised no revenue—the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer. He said on radio in Perth in 2011:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If we don't have the revenue from the tax then we can't make the investments.
        </p>
        <p>
         So there was no revenue and no money, and there were no projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, it was not just the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer, but also the member for Grayndler who, unfortunately, is not here to hear this. When he was the infrastructure minister in this place in 2011, he answered a question in this place from the member for Throsby about the importance of the mining tax and said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But they are only possible if you have revenue from somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mining tax.'
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue here is that there was no revenue from the mining tax when we got to government. There were no projects that would have gone ahead, so we have funded them and are actually pushing the

             But what would make them easier to deliver is getting rid of the mining tax, by getting away from the Greens and backing the coalition to get rid of the mining tax. That is what the Australian people voted for on 7 September. We will keep delivering infrastructure and we will have the infrastructure Prime Minister stand there proudly and deliver it for Australia.
