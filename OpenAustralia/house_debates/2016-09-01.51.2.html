        On behalf of the House, I would like to offer our best wishes to our Paralympic team bound for the 2016

        in Rio next week. The Paralympics has a special place in the hearts of all Australians and, indeed, right around the world. There will be 178 Australians in the athletes' village, and they will compete in 16 sports. Whenever they step out in the green and gold, every time the starter's whistle is blown and at the finish line, 24 million Australians will be cheering them on. We know how hard each of our athletes has worked to get there.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the pleasure of addressing our Paralympians in June to wish them well on the road to Rio, and their spirit and their commitment inspires us all. Each of our Paralympians represent all that is great about our proud sporting nation, and we are reminded of the capacity of sport to inspire, to motivate and to bring out the best in all of us. Like all Australians, I am sure that we are looking forward to watching our athletes compete over the next two weeks. And I have no doubt, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, we wish today the very best of luck to our Paralympic team. We are all behind you.

         'Spirit in motion' is our Paralympians' motto that they take to Rio. It is of great credit to the

         </a>
         and it should be a source of great national pride that Australia is sending a record team to this year's games. In winning the right to represent their country, each and every one of these elite athletes has already achieved tremendously. It is no exaggeration to say that, for every challenge an Olympian overcomes, a Paralympian faces and conquers it 10-times over. Only those closest to them—their parents, partners, coaches, mentors and teammates—truly know the courage and determination required to reach the pinnacle of the

          Paralympic Games
         </a>
         . All Australians can unquestioningly admire our athletes' extraordinary feats of athleticism, fortitude and grace.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am confident we will achieve great success in the pool, on the track, on the court and on the water, with medals in great numbers and of all colours. But there is much more for all of us here in Australia to gain and to learn. I was privileged to attend the Beijing Paralympics in 2008, and it opened my eyes to what the future could be, what the future should be. At the Paralympics, people of all abilities and of all nations mix together as equals. At the Paralympics you very soon stop looking at the impairment and instead see the whole person. What you see are elite athletes who happen to have an impairment. It is a lesson for all time. In the coming weeks, our Paralympians will not just inspire us; they will teach us. In doing so, they will make us all a bit more proud to be Australian.
