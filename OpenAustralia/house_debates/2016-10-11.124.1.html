        Today I would like to share with the House the tremendous efforts of the Beenleigh Tennis Club and their support for a rising young tennis star, Kerry Galhos. Beenleigh Tennis Club is one of our great local sporting clubs, with a passionate team of coaches, players and supporters. Kerry Galhos's story is not the everyday sporting success story. It is one of hard work, sacrifice and generosity from across the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kerry's talent for tennis was first discovered in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        by Gerard, the brother of local tennis coach James Rapkins. After a few short years her journey brought her to Australia, leaving behind her supportive family in Timor so that she could pursue her passion for tennis. Under the guidance of the club's coach, James Rapkins, Kerry's talent for tennis has flourished. Not only has she embraced the Australian lifestyle, language and her tennis training, Kerry is also an academic star and is currently studying a dual political science and communications degree. Through her dedication to her studies and her tennis training, I am very excited to share that our young Beenleigh star is on her way to becoming an international star, with Kerry awarded a full scholarship to study and play in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        A. Study &amp; Play
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        specialises in connecting talented young kids with US universities to further their talent and to receive a first-class universally-recognised education.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Kerry, it has been a tremendous journey from her life in East Timor with little material wealth. But she has studied hard and trained hard and has been awarded this full scholarship in the USA, where she will be fully supported, covering her shoes, socks, other clothes, rackets, accommodation, food and tuition and her travelling within the USA with her new team for the next four years. She will want for nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I caught up with Kerry at the Beenleigh Tennis Club, it was great to see how excited yet humbled this young tennis star was at the opportunities that were being presented to her. Her journey to Australia and her time with the Beenleigh Tennis Club has given her the opportunity to pursue her dreams and make her family back in East Timor very proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate James and the team at the Beenleigh Tennis Club for turning one young lady's dream into a reality. I have no doubt we will see Kerry Galhos back in Australia in no timeâ€”perhaps competing against the world's best in our open grand slam tennis tournament.
