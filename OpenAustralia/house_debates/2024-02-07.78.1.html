        My question is to the Prime Minister. How are Australians responding to Labor's plans to give every taxpayer a tax cut?

         Australians have responded very positively to the government's determination to make a difference for low- and middle-income workers who need further support with cost-of-living pressures. And that is what the government has done. We have a tax package that provides taxpayer relief for every single Australian taxpayer, all 13.6 million of them—not just some, every one of them, including those who earn up to $45,000 a year. But we know as well that, overwhelmingly, middle Australia are the big beneficiaries of our tax package.

         program, Leanne Andrews, a working mum from Toowoomba, in the electorate of Groom, said this: 'We will save money. When the original decision about stage 3 was made it was a different climate. So I do think it's fair to share it across the middle-income and low-income earners.' Tony from Bunya, in the electorate of Dickson, said this: 'We totally support your tax changes. Thank you for being strong enough to make this decision.' Lynette of Glenorchy in Tasmania said: 'Thank you for the tax cuts. It will make a huge difference to the average Australian. Please tell the opposition to take a good look at how the average person lives.' Robyn, of

         , in Bonner, said: 'I want to thank you for redesigning the tax cuts. It was absolutely the right thing to do. It shows fairness to Australia and helps people struggling financially. Thank you so much for standing up for what is right and fair.' Joan, from Cunningham, 'While I will not receive any tax cuts myself, as I am retired, I am grateful that we now have people in government who are genuinely concerned for those in our society who do it tough.'

         These tax cuts are aimed squarely at middle Australia, providing support for those hardworking Australians who need this support. But we're also making sure that people aren't left behind, like under the previous system—making sure that every single Australian gets a tax cut. Eighty-four per cent of Australians will get more than they were going to get. Ninety per cent of women will get more than what they were going to get and 98 per cent of young people between the ages of 18 and 24 will get more than what they were going to get. This is good policy, done for the right reasons.
