        I would like to take this opportunity to promote two revolutionary programs in my electorate that are literally saving people's lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Metabolic Rehabilitation Diabetes program at Camden Hospital is helping severely obese people to lose weight and manage their diabetes by changing their lifestyle. The rehabilitation program started in mid-2009 at Camden Hospital. In 2011 the Metabolic Rehabilitation Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, Fatty Liver and Arthritis programs also started, thanks to financial support from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Sydney
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The program involves obesity and diabetes medical specialists; dieticians; diabetes educators to monitor blood sugar levels and provide advice on how to best use medication; psychologists, physiotherapists and exercise physiologists. About 200 severely obese patients with multiple medical problems have taken part in the programs since 2009. There are currently 297 patients on the waiting list and with the current level of staffing the average waiting time to begin the program is 18 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clinic is run by Dr Nick Kormas, and was established to manage complex, severely obese patients with medical problems directly caused or contributed to by their excess weight. The program is based on the fact that the most effective strategy for managing obesity-induced co-morbidities is to achieve a healthier weight and improve fitness levels. Without the metabolic rehabilitation programs, these patients need huge quantities of medications funded by federal government and prolonged hospitalisation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU" rel="nofollow">

        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        beds. This can cost the government up to $4,000 per day, representing a huge cost to the health system.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently met

        resident Brian Aitken, who is living proof of the fantastic programs run by Dr Kormas and his team of specialists. Mr Aitken is 63 years old and was 207 kilograms when he started the program last year. Brian told me that he was so unwell that his friends and family did not think he would make it to Christmas 2012. But thanks to the rehabilitation clinic he has now lost more than 30 kilograms, no longer has diabetes or sleep apnoea and feels he has a bright and happy future ahead of him. Brian was taking 21 tablets a day; now he takes one. He was on 136 units of insulin per day; now he does not need any. He used to have a problem with an ulcer on his foot; that has been treated and has not come back again.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to his new quality of life Brian is now saving tax payers thousands of dollars each year because he no longer needs the medication, hospital stays and home nursing visits that he previously required.
       </p>
       <p>
        The metabolic clinic in Camden is also supporting our local medical students from the University of Western Sydney. As part of the program, medical, nursing, physiotherapy, psychology and podiatry students all work at the clinic. This represents invaluable training for all of them with the prevalence of obesity in our community at 25 per cent and continuing to rise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also in my electorate is the Southwest Wellness Centre in Narellan, which aims to reduce the burden on the healthcare system by providing a long-lasting change for obesity patients through education and discipline. This program includes regular visits from a team of qualified health professionals, including an exercise physiologist, a psychologist, a physiotherapist, a dietician, a diabetes educator and a general practitioner. I recently met Ben Styles and Rebecca Spain, who run the centre and are very passionate about their Live Longer Obesity and Chronic Illness program to help improve the health of people in Macarthur. They are committed to helping those who are living with obesity related illness to learn new skills and habits that will help them to live longer, healthier lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Programs like these are so important in today's society. A study by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University
        </a>
        earlier this year showed that more than 17 million Australians are overweight or obese and obesity has overtaken smoking as the leading cause of premature death and illness in Australia. It has become the single biggest threat to public health in Australia and the cause of many secondary complications like diabetes, sleep apnoea, heart disease and chronic kidney disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why I wanted to share the great results these programs are having in my community. If we can teach people living with obesity how to improve their health and quality of life this will in turn mean they are no longer a burden on our health system, and that is good news for both the patient and the government. The amount of money saved each year from reduced medications, hospital admissions and health services would help us fund more of these clinics and subsequently improve the overall health of millions of Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clinic at Camden Hospital is a unique service in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , with patients being assessed, treated and supported by a great team of specialists. I have heard from many constituents in Macarthur who have benefited from these programs or have seen family members turn their lives around. I hope to see many more of these public clinics rolled out across New South Wales and increased support for private wellness centres, which are also doing their bit to ease the burden on our health system and save lives.
