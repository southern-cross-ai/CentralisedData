       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for Communications. I refer to the predawn home invasion by protesters at the home of Woodside's chief executive officer and her family. It was filmed by an ABC crew who were also present. Minister, who at the ABC had knowledge of the protesters' plans to carry out this home invasion? Has the minister asked the ABC if the person who took the decision to send along a camera crew in these circumstances will be sacked?

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. I'll start by reiterating the comments of my colleague the Minister for Resources, who has very eloquently and accurately stated that the unacceptable behaviour towards a private citizen in this matter is completely unacceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also note that, whilst the ABC has operational independence as well as editorial independence, its management will offer detailed commentary on this matter. I understand the ABC has confirmed that a television crew was present to film the protest for an upcoming report. According to the statements by the ABC, they had no knowledge of the nature of the behaviour that would occur. I would also reiterate that I have sought further information from the ABC on this matter, in addition to their public statements. However, again I note that the ABC has both operational and editorial independence and I await the further advice that I have requested.
