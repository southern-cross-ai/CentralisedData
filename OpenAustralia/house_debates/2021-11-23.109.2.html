       <p>
        I've risen many times in this chamber to condemn this government's inaction on addressing the appalling state of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Labor, industry stakeholders and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        participants themselves have all criticised this government for the appalling lack of action on this issue. A properly functioning, adequately funded NDIS would be capable of ensuring the safety and dignity of many thousands of the participants. A properly functioning, adequately funded NDIS would enable thousands of disabled Australians to live meaningful lives with the same opportunity to pursue their dreams and aspirations as all other Australians have. I have repeatedly called on the Morrison government to provide support to NDIS participants. Time and time again, they have not only failed to reform these systems but even failed to try.

        Harvey
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKeever" rel="nofollow">
         McKeever
        </a>
        is a 16-year-old boy in our electorate of

        . In February, Harvey's life changed forever when a dirt bike accident on his family's Willowmavin property resulted in him becoming a quadriplegic. He spent seven months in hospital, only being discharged in September. Harvey requires significant rehabilitation and around-the-clock care. Harvey's mum, Renae, has told me and my office that their family are currently awaiting an outcome on their fourth NDIS plan review since June. Renae states that a request for a functional electrical stimulation bike has been refused as not being considered reasonable and necessary for Harvey, despite the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Children's Hospital
        </a>
        and Victorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service experts recommending it for his health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Renae states that, since Harvey's return home, the family is living under temporary and inconvenient conditions while they wait for an outcome on his plan. They've purchased their own portable ramp, a bed and a Showerbuddy so that Harvey could return home from hospital. But they're finding it extremely difficult to continue without certainly and assistance from the NDIS. Home modifications are required, as are physiotherapy, bladder care products and carer services. The NDIS have told Renae that their family's requests will require assessments and quotes from relevant professionals. Renae has already provided these assessments and quotes. The NDIS told her that, if she was unhappy with the outcome of their plan, she would have the right to request an internal plan review. Already she has done this four times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Renae is a mother who wants nothing more than adequate capacity to care for her son at home. Harvey is a 16-year-old young adult who, despite his injuries, is looking forward in life and wants the greatest capacity possible to engage with family, friends and the community. With regard to Harvey's NDIS plan, multiple occupational therapy assessments have already been done, and the family has provided quotes twice regarding home modifications. They have jumped through every single hoop this heartless government has placed before them. In contrast, the McKeever family's communications with Intereach, their NDIS planner, have been almost entirely via emails, some unsigned, often delayed and often unreasonably brief. In an email announcing rejection of the request for funding for the electrical stimulation bike, all the McKeever family received was a line in an unsigned email, with no explanation or further information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vulnerable Australians should not be forced to jump through hoops. They should not have to navigate inane bureaucracy. They should not have to navigate obstacle after obstacle in a system that is offering them nothing in return. Taking away the dignity of Australians living with disabilities is a hallmark of the Morrison government. The inefficient and uncaring system that has been allowed to develop under this government is not just an affront to Australian values; it is an affront to basic human decency. The burden placed on NDIS participants, people who are already under enormous levels of stress and have to keep banging their heads against a brick wall in order to receive basic care, is an absolute disgrace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government have had years to fix these problems that they created, and they haven't. In fact, the problem has got worse and worse on their watch. We need a government that cares about Australians. We need a government that places the issue of vulnerable Australians at the forefront of national policy so that our country moves forward and no-one gets left behind. The Morrison government has seen the NDIS as an inconvenience. Again and again, they've kicked the can down the road, failing to institute the necessary reforms for the safety and efficiency of the NDIS. Labor, industry stakeholders and NDIS participants have all criticised this government for its appalling lack of action. Almost every day in this chamber, my Labor colleagues share stories from their constituents—stories like that of Harvey and his family, NDIS participants completely let down by a broken system. Australians deserve more than this. An Albanese Labor government is the only government that Australians will be able to trust to be honest and deliver a functioning NDIS that gives vulnerable Australians what they—
