       <p>
        I rise to speak about the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the difference it is making to the lives of people with a disability in my electorate of Lindsay. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        is something Labor members are incredibly proud of, particularly as I fought hard for and campaigned for it many, many years ago. It was the previous Labor government that fought for and introduced the scheme that will substantially transform the lives of people with a disability—and I want to highlight the words 'transform the lives', not specifically to care for them, but to transform their lives—and make sure they are able to achieve the level of independence that most of us take for granted. Importantly, the scheme is about creating long-term certainty around disability supports and bringing to an end a system that was described by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        in 2011 as 'underfunded, unfair, fragmented and inefficient'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NDIS was modelled to ensure that people with a disability are able to participate in the community and take control of their own lives. Unfortunately, it does sadden me to say that the National Disability Insurance Agency—the independent statutory body tasked with implementing the NDIS—is not being supported appropriately by this government. I have spoken with multiple people in my electorate who say that the intention of Labor's NDIS is not being realised under this government. This should in no way be seen as a reflection on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        or local service providers. They are a remarkable group of people working incredibly hard and doing the best they can. But many of the process issues that I have heard of need to be addressed if the NDIS is to reach its full potential and deliver the outcomes that we all want.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been told of a young high school student in my electorate who has recently been given a new wheelchair that is not fit for purpose because it is too long, too wide and too heavy for the mother to manoeuvre around the house. As you can appreciate, a wheelchair is a significant aid in giving somebody the independence we speak of. Unfortunately, it is obviously causing significant stress and anxiety within this family. This is one of the resourcing issues I have heard. Another common issue that I hear is that the NDIA often is not able to meet with the users of the scheme face to face because of staffing issues. Clearly this is not an ideal situation and the NDIA agrees but, again, this organisation is constrained by the level resourcing it is allocated by this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another constituent, a young girl in my electorate who has been diagnosed with autism, was found eligible in May this year but has still not been able to finalise a plan six months later. This case is a concern and it demonstrates yet again the continuing issue of properly resourcing the agency to efficiently and effectively process all applications and care plans. I have been told of a gentleman in my electorate who has seen an effective reduction in support after entering into a care plan. Prior to his new plan, he was receiving five days a week in a day program. His new program gives him just one day a week. I have heard time and time again about concerns with the application process—for instance, one young woman who has been sent back and forth to a paediatrician since March this year and who still cannot finalise a care plan. These are issues of resourcing, clearly. It highlights the need to properly resource this agency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other big issue that has come up in my electorate time and time again is that the plans are expiring now. The plans have no succession in place. There are plans that are expiring and people are being left without the supports that their children, particularly those who are in early intervention, require. Appointments are being routinely cancelled because families do not have access to the money that they believe should be in their packages. I believe the government must act to ensure the NDIS is properly resourced to achieve the outcomes it was created for. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, I am extremely proud to continue advocating for the NDIS to make sure it is rolled out in the spirit in which it was intended and with full resourcing.
