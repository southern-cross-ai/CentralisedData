       <p>
        Every year we stand for a minute's silence to remember those Australians who died fighting to protect the values and freedoms which we so dearly cherish. The soldiers we remember were brave individuals, who each made the biggest sacrifice one can ever make: the sacrifice of their own lives for the sake of this country. Each day, thousands of Australian men and women put themselves in harm's way and put their lives at risk to keep us safe and secure. On that note, today I would like to bring the attention of the chamber to the forthcoming 55th anniversary of the sinking of the

         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        on 10 February 1964, which, tragically, claimed 82 lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        This incident has now passed into history as Australia's worst naval peacetime disaster. The story of the
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivors' treatment over the years is a long and sad saga of neglect and injustice. I was speaking recently with Colin Tidball, the Royal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAN" rel="nofollow">

        and retired crew member of HMAS
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        D 04, a local resident. He had something to say to me, and his story just struck me. He said, 'I believe we can restore faith in the system for them and improve their health and the wellbeing of
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivors. That would mean a hell of a lot to them and they deserve that.' HMAS
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        was a Daring class destroyer with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        that was lost in a collision in 1964. During the night of 10 February 1964,
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        and the aircraft carrier HMAS
        <i>
         Melbourne
        </i>
        collided off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervis_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Jervis Bay
        </a>
        when the destroyer passed in front of the carrier during post-refit sea trials. The
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        was cut in two by the collision and sank, with the loss of 82 of the 314 people on board. This was the largest loss of Australian military personnel in peacetime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Immediately after the collision, survivors were told that they did not fall under Veterans' Affairs. It was a shock, to put it plainly. Survivors were told to take it up with Comcare. This was a disaster, because at the time Comcare had no training to deal with a situation of this magnitude. As a consequence, survivors walked away without any counselling, proper referrals for treatment, direction or compassion. Moreover, a comment from a Comcare manager to a
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivor—'What makes you any more special than if two Commonwealth buses full of Commonwealth clerks collided outside Canberra?'—left survivors out in the blizzard.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivors want access to the Commonwealth gold card for members who currently do not have one. I believe this is very fair because others have received it and they were serving for Australia on an Australian Navy vessel. It is understood that this is a privilege, and it would be treated as such by them, as this card would allow
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivors access to treatment that is being denied to them. This would increase their likelihood of living longer lives, and it would also ensure that they realise that the Australian public regard them as proud sailors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other consideration is that
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivors be given access to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Service Medal
        </a>
        1945-1975, the medal I'm holding up today. The reason for this is that
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        was allocated to South-East Asia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Malay Peninsula
        </a>
        once they had completed some exercises in Melbourne. Therefore, the determination of her being an allocated vessel had not changed, and, if the ship had not been sunk through no fault of the crew, they would soon have been doing the job they had been trained for against the communist insurgents in the region. Eighty-two men made the ultimate sacrifice for their service, and many others carry the injuries and scars in their minds forever because they escaped, but the hatches were hammered closed and a lot couldn't escape.
       </p>
       <p>
        HMAS
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        survivors should have access to the Australian Service Medal 1945-1974, not because of the collision but because of their service. It must be understood that
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        was operating in extremely horrendous conditions. That is obvious from its sinking. I hope Colin's struggle is reviewed with compassion. I'll be asking the minister to review this. Let's put aside party politics and penny-pinching and give our defence personnel the outcome they truly deserve, especially all those involved in this awful Australian peacetime disaster.
