       <p>
        Last Friday, 4 November, my community faced large bushfires that threatened lives and homes in Londonderry, Llandilo,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Berkshire Park
        </a>
        and Cranebrook, near Penrith.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to the amazing and professional work of our local emergency services, the fire, which started around 2 pm and quickly spread to neighbouring areas, was under control by early evening that night without any loss of life or injuries. Sadly, there were seven properties that were damaged, several cars were destroyed and livestock as well. Anyone who saw the images of the fire would have seen the ferocity with which it spread through bushland close to homes, and the fact that no-one was injured is a credit to our local emergency services.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to put on record today my sincere thanks on behalf of our community to the

         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        , New South Wales Ambulance, and the Penrith Local Area Command, who were quick to arrest two suspects in relation to deliberately lighting the fire.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were more than 30 crews on the scene, with around 300 firefighters and several air cranes fighting to take control of the situation.

        . This fire is a timely reminder to update your fire plan to make sure properties are well prepared against the threat of fire. I encourage everybody to visit the rfs.nsw.gov.au website and plan and prepare for the bushfire season.
