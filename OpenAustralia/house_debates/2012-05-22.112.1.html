        The Murray-Darling is the most important river system in this country. It is fundamental to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        's very existence. It is, quite simply, our state's lifeblood, and it is my firm opinion that the current 2,750 gigalitres that is outlined in the Murray-Darling Basin draft plan falls short of South Australia getting its fair share. There can be no doubt that history has favoured the upstream states when it comes to water allocation, and South Australia has too frequently been treated as a poor cousin in determining how to care for and how to share the river's resources. At times, what can only be described as arrogance and selfishness have been displayed in regard to our river. We need to be very clear that that bickering must stop now for the sake of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         River Murray
        </a>
        . South Australia have not actually increased the amount of water that we have taken from the Murray since 1969. We use just seven per cent of total extractions from the system. We need now to have our voices heard by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and ensure that their final report reflects the whole river's needs, an adequate return to water to ensure viability and to protect the whole river system, not just vested interests.

        I have been proud to support the
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        's 'I heart Murray' campaign and also to put in a submission on the draft plan, advocating on behalf of my community for an issue that I know many, many people are very passionate about and that many of my local residents have been contacting me about. In particular, I have been arguing not only that we need an adequate return of water but also that groundwater must not be used as a way to compensate upstream irrigators for being required to manage allocations at a more reasonable and sustainable level. We also need to make sure that, as the constraints in the river system are being removed, we are reviewing the possibility of a return of more water going forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Adelaide absolutely understand the importance of the River Murray and, as I meet with people in my electorate, they make it clear that they expect me to advocate for its future, as I have been doing since I was first elected in 2004. I made clear in my maiden speech to this parliament that I would stand and fight for the River Murray, to fight for its survival and to fight for its long-term future. Almost a decade later we finally have a chance to act in a real and a meaningful way. It is vital that this chance is not squandered in further political opportunism or fighting. I urge all members to put the River Murray first because it is vital for our whole nation.
