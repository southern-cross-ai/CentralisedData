       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Smith
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who was awarded his Order of Australia on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        . Kevin Smith received his award for his services to netball, and I can say that it is a service that his whole family has been involved inâ€”a service to Newcastle netball and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        netball. Kevin has been totally dedicated to netball over the years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, the netball oval in Belmont is called the Molly Smith Netball Courts and it is named after his mother, Molly. If she were still alive she would be so proud that Kevin had been awarded the Order of Australia for his contribution to netball. He has been involved in administration, refereeing and every aspect of netball.
       </p>
       <p>
        But although Kevin received his Order of Australia for his contribution to netball, his contribution is not limited to netball. He is very active in the Belmont Residents Group, and he is a person who is a champion for all things within the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kevin, I say to you: thank you very much for your contribution to our community. I know that it has been well and truly appreciated by everyone.
