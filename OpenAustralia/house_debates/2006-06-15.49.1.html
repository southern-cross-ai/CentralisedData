        <p>
         First of all, can I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. I am aware of reports that the World Food Program, which is an agency of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         , has given an organisation called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majelis_Mujahidin_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
          Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia
         </a>
         , known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMI" rel="nofollow">
          MMI
         </a>
         —
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakar_Bashir" rel="nofollow">
          Abu Bakar Bashir
         </a>
         was the co-founder and at one time the chairman of this organisation—95 tonnes of food to donate to victims of the 27 May earthquake in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Java" rel="nofollow">
          Central Java
         </a>
         . It has been brought to my attention that a spokesman for MMI has said that Abu Bakar Bashir intends to distribute this food, which was provided for and by the United Nations, to the victims himself.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me make this absolutely clear. We regard this decision by the World Food Program, by the United Nations, to use MMI as one of the organisations that would distribute food as completely unacceptable. Our Jakarta post has contacted the World Food Program in Indonesia and made that view perfectly clear. Our ambassador in Rome will also be speaking to the World Food Program, whose headquarters are in Rome, during the course of today, when he is able to do so, making the same point: that we regard the use of an organisation like MMI, which was co-founded by Abu Bakar Bashir and of which Abu Bakar Bashir was the chairman, as completely unacceptable. Obviously, this organisation plans to use the distribution of this food, funded by the international community, as a propaganda tool and therefore the United Nations should not allow itself, in any circumstances or through any of its agencies, to be unintentionally, of course, manipulated in that way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me say, just in case honourable members are wondering, that actually no Australian government funds have been given to the World Food Program for the earthquake victims in Yogyakarta. Our aid has gone in different ways. But having said that, Australia is a major contributor—I think off the top of my head it is the third or fourth largest contributor to the World Food Program—so we are particularly sensitive to this type of action.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the second part of the question, the Prime Minister has already indicated that we have made high-level representations to the Indonesians—we have been for quite some time—in relation to the release of Abu Bakar Bashir. Those representations have included a discussion between our acting ambassador, the Charge d’Affaires in Jakarta, and Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. We of course are making the point to the Indonesians that we hope that they will be able to monitor on a continuous basis the activities of Abu Bakar Bashir, but we have reinforced to the Indonesians that under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         resolution 1267 Indonesia is required to ensure that Abu Bakar Bashir, who is listed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         as a terrorist, will not be able to harm people. The restrictions imposed by the UN on Abu Bakar Bashir include the freezing of his assets. No funding can be provided to Abu Bakar Bashir. He is not allowed to travel internationally and he is not allowed access to weapons or to military equipment. The Australian government and the Indonesian government will continue to consult with each other on this issue. I am not going to go into the responses they have given us, excepting to say that we have constructive discussions with them and I think that constructive relationship on this issue will continue.
