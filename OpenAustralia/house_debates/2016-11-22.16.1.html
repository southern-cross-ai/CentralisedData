        I wish to record my thanks to Senator James McGrath, minister assisting the Prime Minister for his visit to the Alta-1 College in my electorate last Thursday to see firsthand the successful alternative education program being delivered there. Currently, Alta-1 caters for the complex needs of more than 430 at-risk youth to keep them engaged in school and learning activities. We were given a tour of the Joondalup campus by principal

        and members of staff who introduced us to a number of young people who are overcoming significant personal challenges to complete their secondary education. Since 2004, Alta-1 has offered education, support and training to young people who are at risk of not making a successful transition through high school. Participants come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are struggling to cope with family dysfunction and mental health and other traumatic issues. A personal recovery and community-building program helps to re-engage the youth back into learning through self-reflection and community involvement. The school's curriculum has been endorsed by the Schools Curriculum and Standards Authority in

        </a>
        , allowing participants to gain credits towards a

        </a>
        . It makes sense for the government to support Alta-1, as these students can go on to participate in the workforce and become productive members of our society.
