        In following the member for Jagajaga I want to also pay my respects and extended condolences for two people who were pillars of the

        community who passed away recently. Firstly, Dr John Lockwood, who was a wonderful doctor who served the community for such a long time in the Healesville region. I did not know John well at all, but I knew a lot of his great work that he performed in Healesville and the surrounding districts. Sadly, he passed away just a couple of weeks ago. On behalf of my constituents, many of whom knew him, I wanted to mention here today in this chamber his wonderful life of achievement and contribution.
       </p>

        I also want to especially pay tribute to

        Sub-branch. She died suddenly just a couple of weeks ago. She performed her role with great dedication. She was always there with a smiling face supporting her husband—

        , who I know well—as a great pillar of strength in the Lilydale RSL Sub-branch. Bob, of course, is deeply shocked and saddened by her sudden passing. Bob has been president of the RSL for a few years now, and I have worked very closely with him in that role.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob is a Vietnam veteran who now dedicates himself full time to the memory of all of those who served from the Lilydale region. For all of those who served in all our conflicts, Bob works very hard to spread the message of the RSL amongst local schools and the community. I last saw Sue with Bob on Anzac Day. Fittingly, it was the biggest Anzac Day service I had seen in Lilydale at dawn; a couple of thousand people turned up. That was very much a tribute to his hard work and Susan’s hard work. All of us from that day will remember her cheerful, smiling face. She worked away back at the RSL preparing for the return of all the soldiers.
