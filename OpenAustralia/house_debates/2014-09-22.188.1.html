        I want to take the opportunity to report to the House in the brief time that I have available a fantastic achievement by a local public school in my area, Helensburgh Public School's Komplete Kaos team made up of students who are at school currently. Andrew Christy, Harri Lahtinen, Jiah Pang, Marnie Parkinson, Matthew Wheatley,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Hayes" rel="nofollow">

        and Nicola Pang have competed in the International First Lego League Open European Championships in Pamplona, Spain.
       </p>
       <p>
        The team won first place in the Innovative Solutions category with their flood warning app that they developed to assist people in flood emergencies. They were required to do a series of design tasks working with Lego. There were 90 teams competing in the competition from 68 countries around the world. It was an absolutely outstanding achievement for a public school in the Illawarra to get together a team and to get community and school support. I really want to congratulate the students but I also, as I said at their special assembly last week, want to congratulate the parents and teachers who I know would have put so much effort not only into getting the students the opportunity to compete but also in supporting them in the cost of doing that. So it is a great, great achievement. Congratulations, and I look forward to bigger and better wins in the next international Lego competition.
