          Public Works
         </a>
         Committee Act 1969
        </i>
        , and by reason of the urgent nature of the works, it is expedient that the following work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Dubai
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Exposition" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 25 March 2018, the government announced Australia's participation at the 2020 World Exposition. Australia's participation at Expo 2020 presents a unique opportunity to deliver a distinct image of Australia in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . Through engaging exhibits and targeted business and cultural programs, Australia will be promoted as a secure destination for investment, a producer of innovative and high-quality products and a provider of quality education and other services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expo 2020 will be the first international expo held in the Middle East. Themed around mobility, sustainability and opportunity, it will take place in Dubai, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
         United Arab Emirates
        </a>
        , from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021. Expo 2020 is expected to attract more than 25 million visitors, with more than 70 per cent of visitors expected to come from outside the United Arab Emirates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        has responsibility for this project and will manage Australia's presence at the expo. The Public Works Committee has been briefed on the project by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and supports the project taking place. The Public Works Committee will maintain a connection to the project, receiving regular briefings and updates on the progress of the project as well as a post-implementation report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Previous Australian pavilions at world expositions in Seville, in 1992; Hanover, in 2000; and Aichi, in 2005, were exempted from referral to the Public Works Committee on the grounds of urgency. Like these previous projects, the lead times between the announcement of Expo 2020 participation and the fixed deadline of the expo's opening are insufficient to undertake the design, build, statutory approvals and fit-out processes as well as accommodating a full formal Public Works Committee referral process. I commend the motion to the House.
