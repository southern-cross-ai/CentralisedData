        My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrylands_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Merrylands High School
        </a>
        in my electorate, where 70 per cent of students speak a language other than English at home. Given that the Minister for Education has confirmed that his deals are 'no strings attached', will the minister guarantee that individual students at Merrylands High School will receive the Gonski loading for students with limited English?

           and Queensland, which will pay for base funding and loadings in those states over the next four years. That is the formula for the model and so, axiomatically, that means that loadings and the base funding will be contributed to by the Commonwealth. That also means that, from 2014 onwards,

           will all have their funding entirely secured. This means that loadings and base funding will also be paid for, contributed to by the Commonwealth in those states and territories. What the government can guarantee is that we are putting $1.2 billion more into the school funding model to ensure that the full amount of money flows to the states—

             No, repeating the question does not constitute a point of order. The point of order has to show where the relevance is required. There is no point of order.

              One of the members opposite just said, 'Has he even mentioned loadings?' I think if they check the
              <i>
               Hansard
              </i>
              record they will find I have mentioned it several times already in this answer. If the member for Parramatta knew anything about how the model worked, she would have been too embarrassed to move her point of order, because, of course, the Commonwealth pays the money to the states and territories. The states and territories distribute it to the students and to the schools. This was the model under Labor, under the Howard government, under the Rudd-Gillard government—which apparently never happened—and it is the model under the Abbott government. It is called block funding to states and territories and to the Catholics. The only schools that are directly funded by the Commonwealth are independent schools, and even that money flows through the states first and then to the independent schools. The whole problem with the opposition's position on this is that they do not understand the model. They do not understand the education system. It is very complicated, I grant you, but when the member for Parramatta is given a question by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House she should check it herself. Because by the very fact of putting $1.2 billion in that the Leader of the Opposition ripped out, we are securing the funding for all other states and territories. If Labor had been re-elected, there would have been no conditions, loadings or base funding support for

                They were giving them nothing at all. The public will dismiss all the cant and hypocrisy you hear from the other side of the House, because they know that one side is giving $1.2 billion, while the other side was giving a great big fat zero to three important jurisdictions in Australia.
