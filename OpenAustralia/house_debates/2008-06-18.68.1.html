        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his answers to my questions yesterday regarding the member for Robertson. What advice did the Prime Minister’s office provide to the member for Robertson or her office before her media statements regarding the Iguana Bar incident?

        <p>
         I am unaware of what advice may have been provided. I am just unaware.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         say to those opposite on this matter that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stood in this place yesterday and asked a question about these affairs. She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I refer the Prime Minister to his statement at a press conference in Japan on 9 June, in answer to questions about the member for Robertson, when the Prime Minister said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... I understand my office has been in contact. And ... I understand she has issued a statement ...
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Curtin continued:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Given that the member for Robertson did not issue a statement until the following afternoon of 10 June, what involvement did the Prime Minister’s office have in the preparation of that statement?
        </p>
        <p>
         That is the question asked yesterday. Again:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Given that the member for Robertson did not issue a statement until the following afternoon of 10 June ...
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, the inference is this. I made a statement in Japan on 9 June and referred to the fact that a statement had been issued. The member for Curtin is saying that the facts were that there was no statement from the member for Robertson until 10 June. That is just untrue. You stood in the chamber yesterday making a complete untruth, and you stand condemned for it.
