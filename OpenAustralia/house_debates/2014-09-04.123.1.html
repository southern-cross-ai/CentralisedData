        If we based our hopes for future generations on media reports alone, it would be understandable to feel pessimistic and concerned. However, I recently had the privilege of again participating in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        Parliamentary Program—in which, Madam Speaker, I know you are a regular participant—and one of the standouts for me was the number of young men and women who took so much pride in being key members of the Royal Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        and, even more significantly, those who worked long hours to support the pilots, maintain the aeroplanes and operate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        bases. Indeed, without their crucial contribution to a myriad roles—from security, fuel quality, cleaning and catering to maintenance, air traffic control and refuelling, to name just a few—our Air Force would be grounded.
       </p>

        It is my involvement with the ADF Parliamentary Program that has really brought home to me the day-to-day challenges that face our Defence Force. Through this program, members and senators develop a better appreciation of the outstanding work undertaken by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. It is a unique opportunity to get out from behind a desk and briefly experience the challenges of life in the Navy, Army or Air Force, while developing a broader understanding of the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force.

        For a week in August this year, I joined some of my parliamentary colleagues on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Pitch_Black" rel="nofollow">
         Exercise Pitch Black
        </a>
        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , where we experienced the challenges of life in the Air Force. Pitch Black is the Royal

        's largest and most complex exercise, which enables them to train with international air forces in the Northern Territory every two years. As part of Exercise Pitch Black this year, representatives from Singapore, the

        , Thailand and Australian air forces, with support from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        , ran operations from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Darwin" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Darwin
        </a>
        , while at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Tindal" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Tindal
        </a>
        , near Katherine, other Australian Air Force personnel worked alongside their counterparts from the United States and French New Caledonia. I must say how impressed I was with RAAF Base Tindal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Participants in Pitch Black engage in a range of activities, including offensive and defensive counter air missions, joint airspace control, attack control and combat support. The planning, implementation and briefings associated with the exercise were very impressive; but, for me, even more interesting were the post-event analysis and debriefings. I wish to particularly thank our group escort, Wing Commander Read-Jones; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Chief of Air Force
        </a>
        , Air Marshal Geoff Brown; RAAF Base Darwin commander Wing Commander Wesley Perrett; RAAF Base Tindal commander Wing Commander Mark Larter; and all our wonderful RAAF men and women who were so generous with their valuable time and especially their patience.
       </p>

        There were many highlights during the week, including being in the back of a Hercules as an advance group parachuted out the open back; standing outside on the top of Darwin air traffic control tower at night as the fighter planes took off with their afterburners aglow; piloting a Hornet jet fighter—well, a simulator, at least, which was probably just as well, as my landing could have been very expensive otherwise; and inspecting the capabilities of the new Wedgetail patrol planes at Tindal. Another unexpected special moment was when Air Force Three landed to refuel on the way to Sydney with

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This was the fourth opportunity I have had to participate in the ADF Parliamentary Program and each time I have enjoyed developing a broader understanding of the roles and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force personnel, and forging friendships with the dedicated men and women of the ADF. Between wars and peacekeeping, the Australian Defence Force has made a remarkable contribution all over the world. The ADF Parliamentary Program gives us all the opportunity to get a small sample of their role and experience, their contribution and their point of view. Especially valuable is the opportunity to talk to our troops and get the benefit of their insight. My understanding of the Defence Force and of the demands we make on our troops—and, importantly, what great men and women they are—has been truly enriched by my experiences as part of this program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I place on record my appreciation to all the service men and women involved in Pitch Black 2014, particularly for their patience and consideration. I have been delighted this week to have the opportunity to host Squadron Leader Aleisha Broadhead on a reciprocal basis, and she joins us on the floor of the chamber this afternoon.
