       <p>
        Last week I was pleased to catch up with a number of retired police officers in my electorate for a coffee down by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woronora_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The catch-up was prompted by the government's recent changes in the eligibility criteria for the National Police Service Medal. Previously, police officers whose service had concluded between 14 February 1975 and 30 October 2008 were ineligible for this distinguished medal. But I am proud that our government has changed that. An estimated 20,000 retired police officers across the nation are now eligible for this most prestigious honour, which recognises 15 years of ethical and diligent service as an Australian police officer. I am glad to be part of the government that fixed this historical oversight, and I look forward to this process being moved forward quickly.

        I would like to say how important this medal is. I was contacted by a retired police officer who told me the story of how he had been shot at and how he had been stabbed. He is currently undergoing some quite heavy-duty chemotherapy. The message he gave to me asked whether we as a government could ensure, just in case something went wrong with the treatment, that he could get that medal before he passed away. That is how important that medal is to those 20,000 police officers. I am very proud that our government has fixed this so that they will all be eligible to receive this most prestigious medal.
