       <p>
        I briefly congratulate everyone participating in the nation's big events this weekend—the Broncos and the Roosters, who are meeting in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        Women's grand final, and those who are meeting in the NRL men's grand final, the Storm and Panthers. I congratulate all those competing in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        grand final, of which there's been much commentary and much spirit in question time today—Geelong and Richmond. Like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Vixens" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Vixens
        </a>
        , who won the Super Netball premiership last weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank the fans of these great codes for keeping both of these great codes alive this year. Their commitment to the game was under test just as it was for the game's administrators and their many players, being involved in the bubbles of their teams and being away from their families. It was a great relief for all of us who enjoy these things to be able on a weekend to see those great matches, see the great contests. We're going to see it again this evening. I congratulate the AFL's Gil McLachlan and Richard Goyder for their great leadership through this season of the AFL. And I congratulate Peter V'landys and Andrew Abdo, who have also shown great strength in making sure that everyone got on the park this year. We look forward to some great contests this weekend.

         on indulgence—I join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Vixens" rel="nofollow">
          Melbourne Vixens
         </a>
         on their victory last weekend and I look forward to watching on telly the Geelong-Richmond grand final. I think that both of those teams, as Victorian teams, have had it particularly tough during this season, and they deserve absolute credit—the players and all of the clubs associated with them—for what is a remarkable achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Storm" rel="nofollow">
          Melbourne Storm
         </a>
         , who are playing on Saturday night, have based themselves on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Sunshine Coast
         </a>
         there in Queensland, away from family, friends and their homes. That is particularly tough, and it's a great achievement for them to get through to the grand final. My head says they'll be successful. My heart says Penrith! But I do think that Melbourne Storm have been the most successful team over the last decade. But I hope it is a good game and I hope it's not decided by one foot being on the wrong side of the line in a 40-20 kick, which is what happened with Adam Reynolds last week—and no, Mr Speaker, I'm not over it yet! Three preliminary finals in a row we've lost,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          South Sydney
         </a>
         , but I wish them all well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, on the Rugby League Women's grand final between the Roosters and the Broncos: it's been a great initiative that women are playing in big numbers. There's been big growth in women and young girls playing rugby league and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
          AFL
         </a>
         . So, to everyone associated with those sports: it has been good, during what has been a difficult year, for people to be able to watch the footy on the weekend, and I congratulate all associated with the codes.

          I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I associate myself with their remarks. I'll be focused very much on the
