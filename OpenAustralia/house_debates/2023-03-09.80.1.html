         Thanks to the member for Lyons. I'm happy to report this is a big day, a great day, with great progress made on bringing in the National Reconstruction Fund, one of the greatest investments in manufacturing capabilities in living memory. And it was driven by the Prime Minister's vision of a future made in Australia, a vision that this country should make things—that a country that makes things makes great, secure jobs. Eighty-five per cent of the jobs in manufacturing are full time. That's very important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is a land of plenty, as we know. We've got resources, both natural and human, that are the envy of the world. The government wants to put those resources to work to unlock our nation's full potential, working across government to improve skills, deliver research and secure natural resources. With the passage of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRF" rel="nofollow">
          NRF
         </a>
         legislation through the House, we're on the cusp of transforming Australian manufacturing. It's something to be proud of, something that people here are very proud of and are willing to fight for. It's something that those on the crossbench believe in and recognise as something worth fighting for.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, in trying to progress the legislation, we had to deal with the 'no-alition'.

          Order! The minister can resume his seat. I've ruled on this previously. The coalition are to be referred to by their titles, including their 'coalition' name.

           Understood, and I totally withdraw. But what we did have to deal with was Liberal and National parties who haven't used the time going into opposition to reflect, to think about doing things differently. Instead, they've blown the dust off the old

             Stay away from the swimwear. Don't be eatin' them raw onions. Remember the difference between 'repository' and 'suppository'. It's very important to do, because it is important that you do not morph into that.
            </p>
            <p>
             We remain committed—and I say this to you, Leader of the Opposition—to working with the coalition on this if you're interested. But you cannot—in all seriousness, friends—claim to be the party of the working class and then vote against Aussie manufacturing. You cannot vote against blue-collar jobs. You cannot vote against making sure that people do well. No party of the working class votes against manufacturing, at all. You have a chance to redeem yourselves, and you can. We'll work with the Senate, we'll continue this, and we will deliver a great, nation-building piece of legislation.
