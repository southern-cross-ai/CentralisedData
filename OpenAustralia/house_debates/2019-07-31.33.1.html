        By 7 am, and on some days even earlier,

        railway station is full. Commuters who are trying to get to work, university and appointments are turned away. They have two choices: to drive to work or to another station, or to park illegally.
       </p>
       <p>
        The station car park is woefully inadequate, and it has been since it was opened by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Liberal state government eight years ago. It has 452 spaces, with 10,000 people living near the station—and more are moving in every day. Before the 2019 state election in March, the local member and the Liberal government promised $40 million to provide 700 extra spaces by 2020. Our residents were happy with that, that they would finally have somewhere to park. But after the state election, the Liberal government has changed all that. They earmarked $212,000 in the state budget for, I'm told, what they need to engage with the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community doesn't need any further consultation, and have made it clear with constant letters, emails and petitions that they need a car park and they need it now. If the member for Holsworthy, the Minister for Transport and Roads and the Premier need to consult the community, I suggest they visit the station early one morning with me. I'm sure the community would be more than happy to tell them that the car park is needed now. I call on the New South Wales state Liberal government to build the parking station they promised—our community deserves it.
