        <p>
         Why does the Leader of the Opposition continually misrepresent what I have said and the context in which it was said? Throughout this pandemic we have been guided and supported by outstanding medical professionals, whether they be Professor Murphy, Professor Kelly or, indeed, Professor McVernon—who Australians heard from today—from the Doherty Institute, whether it's those who run the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
          Therapeutic Goods Administration
         </a>
         or those who run the other expert medical advisory bodies. What we did in this country was not rush the approvals of important vaccines for this country and not put the health of Australians at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition would have had us rush the approvals of vaccines that were to be used by Australians. That is what Professor Murphy and I were referring to.

            <p>
             I repeat what I said, because this is what Professor Murphy and I—this was the context. We have ensured that throughout this we have, of course, listened. But those opposite—I remember the Leader of the Opposition doing it back in January and making criticisms of the government as well as we were working through the careful medical process.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we have done as a government is ensure that the vaccines that are available for Australians are as safe as they possibly can be. I notice that the member for Maribyrnong has understood that, because he's been down to the

               My point is this: all the way through, the government has sought to get safe vaccines to the Australian people with a great sense of urgency, and to ensure that it's done in a careful, scientific way that is supported by the health advice provided to this government. If the Leader of the Opposition would spend a bit more time promoting the vaccination program rather than promoting himself—

                   Today we released the Doherty institute modelling, the finest expert scientific modelling on the medical epidemiology of this pandemic. Virtually nowhere else in the world, Mr Speaker, will you find a country that has in the same way diligently looked to set the vaccination targets which are essential to the successful rollout of this program and knowing where—

                    The Prime Minister will resume his seat. I can't hear the Manager of Opposite Business on a point of order on relevance.

                    No, because there has already been one asked during this question. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question. If the Manager of Opposition Business would just resume his seat for a second. The question didn't have a preamble and it was very specific. Whilst I appreciate that the Prime Minister wants to talk about the earlier news conference today and other aspects of the vaccine rollout, he was asked very specifically about a quote that has been used a number of times. Certainly the Prime Minister was very relevant in how he addressed that. I did have those on my left

                    that he wasn't, but he certainly was in terms of how he was answering the question at the start. The Leader of the Opposition raised his point of order. The Prime Minister has been relevant, but now is not an opportunity to talk about the rest of the vaccine program or any developments that happened today. The Prime Minister.
