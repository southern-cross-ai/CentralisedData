         Of course my department and the government will cooperate with the Auditor-General's investigations, but I am surprised that the opposition would raise this job-destroying decision of the Victorian Labor government at a time when we are desperately trying to boost our economy through substantial investment in infrastructure and to get those projects moving as quickly as we possibly can to provide jobs for people whose task building some of the new mining infrastructure in our country is coming to a close. We need to provide those jobs and big projects like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West" rel="nofollow">
          East West
         </a>
         Link were significant parts of that plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor is walking away it seems from this major job-creating scheme. Labor is walking away from 7,000 jobs. We want to revolutionise the movement of traffic around the city of Melbourne. They now seek to criticise those who want to get on with the job.

             <p>
              Through his interjection the shadow minister is inviting me to again refer to our $50 billion infrastructure program—scores of new projects around the nation that create jobs for Australians in every state, jobs that will make a difference to the quality of the infrastructure in our nation and indeed in many instances projects which Labor oppose and would certainly never have funded. The reality is that the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West" rel="nofollow">
               East West
              </a>
              project was one of those, a project that could have made an enormous difference to Melbourne's traffic flow and of course created 7,000 jobs, which would already be being created now. Labor ought to not seek to draw attention to their disgraceful record in this regard in seeking to destroy the job opportunities of Victorians and the chance to build a stronger economy in that state and across our nation.
