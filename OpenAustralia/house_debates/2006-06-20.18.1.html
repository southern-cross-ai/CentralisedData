        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement of Reno Lia, an electrical worker, who told Labor’s

          Thank you, Mr Speaker; I am about to. Prime Minister, isn’t it the case that, under the government’s industrial relations legislation, overtime payments and penalty rates are no longer protected, and this threatens the aspirations of families such as the Lias?

           I must confess, in reply to the question asked by the honourable member, that I am at a distinct disadvantage because I do not get invited to meetings of the Labor Party’s
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
            IR
           </a>
           task force. I am quite certain that if I were invited to meetings of the task force I would be able to inject a bit of intellectual rigour into what they are debating. And do you know what I would ask that person and also the gentleman referred to in the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition? I would ask those gentlemen: do you recall 17 per cent interest rates? Do you recall that in 1996 industrial disputes were monumentally higher?

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
               ALP
              </a>
              ’s industrial relations task force and I was suggesting, Mr Speaker, that if they asked the right questions they would get completely objective answers. As for the questions that ought to be asked, they ought to be asked: what has happened to productivity? What has happened to employment? What has happened to taxation? What has happened to interest rates? What has happened to the general prosperity of Australia? What has happened to real wages? I would be asking what the real wage rise was between 1983 and 1996. I would have to truthfully answer, if I were a member, ‘1.3 per cent’. I would ask what it was between 1996 and 2006. Truthfully, I would have to say ‘16.8 per cent’. I have finished my answer, Mr Speaker.
