        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_River" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence River
        </a>
        runs through the heart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley
        </a>
        and its capital of Grafton. I would say it is the most beautiful and impressive river in this country. You cannot live in the Clarence Valley and not be touched by the Clarence River, be it physically or emotionally. It gives much. There are many industries, whether it be agriculture or fishing, that bring wealth to this region, thanks to the river. Obviously, there are many recreational pursuits as well. Often when you are near the Clarence there are many boating and other water activities happening on its majestic stream. Besides being physically beautiful, it also takes as well through the many floods, when the Clarence really ragesâ€”it takes from our community in those tough times.

        , back in the early 1800s, described as: 'Plains of a boundless extent' lying between

       <p>
        The river and valley now support a population of more than 50,000 people. It rises on the eastern slopes of the

         Tooloom Creek
        </a>
        and the Mann, Nymboida, Cataract, Orara, Coldstream and Esk rivers. The river reaches its mouth between Iluka and Yamba. It descends over 250 metres on its course of early 400 kilometres. On its journey it passes through the towns of Tabulam and Copmanhurst, the city of Grafton, and the towns of Ulmarra, and Maclean, amongst many others. The river features many large river islands, including Woodford, Chatsworth, Ashby and Harwood islands, and the

        near Grafton. As I said, it supports many industries. It gives great wealth to our region and is physically beautiful. I encourage anyone, including you, Madame Deputy Speaker, to visit the Clarence and experience the wonderful things that it has to offer.
