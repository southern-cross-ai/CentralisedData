       </p>
       <p>
        The Surfing Walk of Fame was initiated in 2006 and recognises and celebrates the outstanding achievement of Australia's leading surfers and surf lifesavers. In their honour, a bronze plaque is laid into the promenade at the beach and a large crowd gathers for the unveiling of the plaques each year. This year's inductees were a special group of four people, including ironwoman Candice Warner; Olympian and surf lifesaving champion, Graham 'Johno' Johnson; pro surfer,

       </p>
       <p>
        Candice Warner first competed professionally at the age of 14 in the Ironwoman Series. At 16, she was the

        The crowd was treated to a cracking day of beautiful weather and a very large swell. They saw a surfing competition, a skateboard competition, sand sculptors and local craft stores with face painting. The young guns also kept people entertained with the 2017 grommet state surf titles, throwing up some spectacular surfing amid powerful waves. Jai Glinderman and Cedar Leigh-Jones claimed the titles, taking out the under-14 divisions respectively.

        I congratulate all of those who were inducted into the Australian Surfing Walk of Fame recently at Maroubra. I thank them for their service to our nation, our community and surfing, and congratulations to Randwick council on running another spectacular event.
