         I want to thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         , who, as a former member of the police force, has worked with the emergency services over many years. He knows the risks and challenges that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandenong_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
          Dandenong Ranges
         </a>
         face in dry seasons, as do you, Mr Speaker, and this may well be one of the driest seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the last two years, largely at the instigation of both the Speaker and, in particular, the member for La Trobe, the government has implemented the $3 million Dandenong Ranges Wildlife Recovery, Weed Management and Fuel Reduction Program, $2.4 million of which has been allocated to fuel reduction. Twenty-nine community groups have already participated and received just over $1 million of grant funding. What does this mean? It means that groups such as the Belgrave South
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
          CFA
         </a>
         have been able to reduce weeds and fuel loads to reduce the risk of bushfire. We cannot remove that risk entirely, but we can decrease the chances and mitigate the consequences. This is a very important action. In addition, groups such as the Friends of Sassafras Creek have undertaken practical work in reducing weed and fuel loads and rehabilitating and restoring native habitat by removing invasive species. These are very practical environmental programs, which are helping the local environment, supporting community groups and, in particular, reducing and mitigating the risk of bushfires.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another $450,000 has been allocated to removing wandering trad in an area that is one of Australia's great natural habitats. These invasive species offer a risk to the viability of the native wildlife and, in particular, the native plants. There has been a removal and a rehabilitation program, as well as support for Indigenous groups. On top of that, I think we have allocated nine
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Green Army
         </a>
         projects so far, of which five have been completed, two are underway and another two are due to start shortly. In particular, they have attacked the problem of invasive species, given opportunities to young people and made a real difference to the Dandenong Ranges. It is an important combination of events and projects. The Dandenong Ranges Wildlife Recovery, Weed Management and Fuel Reduction Program is helping community groups and the environmentâ€”and, along with the Green Army, it is giving young people a real opportunity to find work and a future for themselves.
