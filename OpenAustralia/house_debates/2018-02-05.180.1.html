        One of the great joys of being a member of parliament is attending marvellous events which celebrate our vibrant multicultural communities. To commence 2018, I was honoured to represent Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a self-proclaimed philhellene, at the 34th annual Theophania, the Blessing of the Waters festival, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which pays homage to the baptism of Jesus in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Jordan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Indeed, the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Greek community in Australia is remarkable on the tradition that goes back thousands of years and it ensures that the Greek language and culture remain alive in Australia and around the world. I would like to acknowledge two people who were at the event: Reverend George Adamakis, parish priest of Sts Anargiri parish in Oakleigh, for his tireless work as spiritual leader of the Chisholm Greek community as well as of the broader community and its surrounds, and also His Grace Bishop Ezekiel for his great dedication to the Greek community.

        Australians of Greek heritage have greatly influenced and enhanced our national Australian story and play prominent roles in politics, business, science and the arts. As an Australian of proud migrant heritage, it is also a great personal honour to have been appointed the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Greece Group under the Turnbull government. I again congratulate the Greek community of Chisholm and Melbourne on a wonderful Theophania and look forward to a 2018 filled with warm and festive community celebrations, including the
