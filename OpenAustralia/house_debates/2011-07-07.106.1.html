        On Sunday, I was privileged to attend the Reserve Forces Day function held by the National Servicemen's Association at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Memorial_Gardens" rel="nofollow">
         Victory Memorial Gardens
        </a>
        monument in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        , where the Reserve Forces Day Council announced that during the celebrations the Recognition Medallion would be presented to 19 people who have given so much for their country and for their partners in the reserves. We all know what a great part reserves play in this country. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who is at the table, as a former long-serving and distinguished army officer would also acknowledge the fact that reserves are often the ones first sent into combat, and that they do so much to keep this nation safe and to keep our democracy in great shape.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the Riverina recipients of the Recognition Medallion: in Leeton, Phyllis Hunt and Mary Tasker; and in Wagga Wagga, Shirley Bowman, Rita Cameron, Wendy Clay, Ruth Cantwell, Elaine Dudley,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Henry" rel="nofollow">

        , Shirley Holden,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Wells" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir Laurence Street, National Chairman of the Reserve Forces Day Council, said, 'The Recognition Medallion will in some way serve to honour their stalwart support for all those family members in uniform who chose a part-time military career. It is a small token of our thanks and gratitude for the extra workload they embraced in order to release a person who was then able to leave home in order to bolster Australia's defences.'
       </p>
       <p>
        On Sunday, it was great to catch up with Brigadier Wayne Dunbar, who had a distinguished career with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        and served at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Recruit_Training_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Army Recruit Training Centre
        </a>
        , then known as the 1st Recruit Training Battalion at Kapookaâ€”
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blamey_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Blamey Barracks
        </a>
        . That is the home of the soldier where all army recruits go to learn the rigours of battle before being sent on their deployments. I had not seen Brigadier Dunbar since 1983-84. He gave an eloquent and moving speech on behalf of those recipients of the medallions. The main street was a sea of movement and colour as the proud reservists marched down the street in their numbers, rode in jeeps or on horses and waved flags. It was a sight to see and I truly acknowledge the part that reserves play for our country and I also acknowledge those recipients of the Recognition Medallion. Well done to them, one and all.
       </p>

        House adjourned at 17 : 00
