        I rise to speak about a local project in my electorate of Swan. It is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Football Club
        </a>
        grandstand, which, I must add, is anything but grand. First, I'd like to give a shout-out to the fantastic win by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        grand final. It was the best grand final in a few years, and I was incredibly proud to be a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        n. Collingwood played well in the first quarter, but the West Coast Eagles boys demonstrated an unwavering strength and stamina to pull ahead at the final siren. It was great to have the Prime Minister in Perth the following week, and the member for Curtin and I were delighted to take him to the West Coast Eagles club headquarters to congratulate the boys on an outstanding performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll return to the grandstand at Perth Football Club. I've spoken about this grandstand a number of times in the chamber. It's decrepit, riddled with concrete cancer and no longer fit for the purpose of holding not only the members of my community of Swan but those who support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Demons" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Demons
        </a>
        as well. The grandstand is located at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathlain_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Lathlain Park
        </a>
        . It is home to the Demons, and the West Coast Eagles football club is going to move their administration and training facilities to Lathlain Park. In 2016, the coalition government provided $13 million towards the $68 million development of Lathlain Park to support economic growth in the Victoria Park area. It's a fantastic project, and it's something our whole community is very proud of. I will add that it's coming along very nicely, and the West Coast Eagles expect to move there early next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project has a community focus to ensure my constituents will have access to some of the incredible facilities going up in the new facility. It is also supporting great organisations such as the Special Air Services Resources Trust and the Wirrpanda Foundation. That brings me back to the grandstand. It was originally built in 1959, a year after I was born. I've just had my 60th, to save you the maths.

          Yes, I'm holding it togetherâ€”thank you, Nicolle! But the grandstand has become an eyesore amongst the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathlain_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Lathlain Park
          </a>
          development and is unfit to hold the growing communities of Victoria Park, Lathlain and, more broadly, Swan. I worked closely with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
           Perth Football Club
          </a>

           West Coast Eagles
          </a>
          to discuss the needs of the club and the community. With more than 10,000 kids involved in sport activities at the facility on an annual basis, it's time to demolish the old grandstand and build a new standalone facility which will take the Perth Football Club and Lathlain into the next century.
         </p>
         <p>
          I look forward to continuing to work closely with both clubs, the community and the

           Town of Victoria Park
          </a>
          to ensure the growing needs of our community are addressed. I'll be working hard in my electorate to deliver on local issues like the Perth Football Club grandstand. It was convenient I caught up with the Treasurer for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
