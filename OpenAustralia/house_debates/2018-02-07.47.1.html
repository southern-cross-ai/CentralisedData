        It was on this day in 2009 that 173 people perished in the flames of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">
         Black Saturday
        </a>
        , 40 people suffered very serious injuries and 3,500 properties were destroyed. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction, I remember the burnt-out car wrecks, with melted steelâ€”it looked like a war zone. I remember the public meetings, the stories of life, death, anger, grief and shock, and people wondering how on earth they would start again. There are whole towns whose history will be forever divided into before and after that terrible day in February 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we remember everyone who fought the long struggle to rebuild and who fought with insurance or underinsurance or none at all. We mourn all the loved ones lost, yet Black Saturday reminded us there is nothing ordinary about everyday Australians. We saw the very best of our people: the heroism of the voluntary and professional emergency services, and the generosity and optimism of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs
        </a>
        , Rotary, scouts, girl guides, school communities, church groups and football and netball clubs. There were so many good-hearted Australians who gave their time and energy to help people get back on their feet and make shattered communities whole. Nothing can ever restore these communities to the way they were before the fire, but I know that the bravery of those who've worked so hard will stay with me forever. Finally, let us remember those who were lost and hold those who grieve in our hearts.

         I would briefly associate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. As someone who represents an electorate that was deeply affected by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">
          Black Saturday

         fires, I certainly remember the Leader of the Opposition in his previous capacity, and the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition, being out there in the days after those tragic fires.
