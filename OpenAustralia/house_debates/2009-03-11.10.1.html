        I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Serbia" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Serbia
        </a>
        and to the 119th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Geneva, Switzerland, 4 to 18 October 2008, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a very important delegation, as it was the first Australian parliamentary delegation to visit the Republic of Serbia. As such, a major objective was to establish relations with the new Serbian parliament. This was achieved through a series of valuable and informative meetings held with the speaker and vice-speaker of the national assembly, with ministers, secretaries of state and political leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Serbia is a young democracy, and the delegation was impressed by the continuing efforts to develop and enhance democratic traditions. The delegation considers that Australia could provide assistance in strengthening parliamentary democracy by sponsoring exchanges of parliamentary staff and/or officials through AusAID programs or through the Australian parliament. The delegation was also impressed by the younger, well-educated, progressive and professional generation of ministers and political leaders that it met. They have great dedication and confidence in the future of their country and see membership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        as the way ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two major issues were constantly raised during our meetings. The first was the move towards membership of the EU, which has strong support politically and within the population. The harmonisation of laws being undertaken across ministries to meet European requirements has the added result of bringing strong benefits economically and socially to Serbia. However, disappointment was expressed that the Dutch parliament continued to block further progress by refusing to ratify the EU Stabilisation and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
         Association Agreement
        </a>
        . Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Yugoslavia" rel="nofollow">
         Former Yugoslavia
        </a>
        , including all possible efforts to arrest and transfer indictees, is an essential element of the agreement. Serbia has been cooperating fully with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" rel="nofollow">
         The Hague
        </a>
        Tribunal and European requirements by arresting and transferring to The Hague many people, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radovan_Karadzic" rel="nofollow">
         Radovan Karadzic
        </a>
        . The delegation did not find evidence of any reluctance to pursue the two remaining indictees, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratko_Mladic" rel="nofollow">
         Ratko Mladic
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The second major issue related to Kosovo. The delegation gained a deeper understanding of Serbia’s position on the issue of Kosovo’s independence and Serbia’s perspective on the region. Serbia regards Kosovo as an integral part of its identity and remains very determined not to recognise Kosovo’s independence. Significantly, Serbia chose to pursue its strong objections through diplomacy and the rule of law, which saw Kosovo’s independence referred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT

        by a

        </a>
        vote during the delegation’s visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Serbia is very aware of its former image and is very keen that its commitment to and utilisation of international legal procedures will enhance its new image, emphasise its emerging democratic status and gain international respect. In addition to adopting pro-European policies, Serbia remains committed to regional cooperation. It is actively involved in a range of regional organisations and initiatives. Serbia is in a position of strength within the Balkan region and is a key to stability in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that the world community encourage and support a democratic and pro-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Serbia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Serbia
        </a>
        . The delegation also met with a range of people from across a broad spectrum of society. The delegation considers that there is significant potential for increased cooperation or bilateral agreements across many sectors. Trade is at very low levels and offers scope for development. The scientific, technological and educational sectors are areas where exchanges of information and expertise could provide significant benefits and development. In education the greatest potential exists at the tertiary level and especially in cooperation with research and the opportunity for student exchanges to pursue graduate or postgraduate study and research. The environmental and resources sectors also provide potential for assistance, especially in the areas of environmental protection and waste management. Culture and the arts are areas that could also benefit from Australian support and assistance, financial or otherwise. A highly developed and sophisticated artistic scene in Serbia is led by a number of extremely motivated and dynamic people. While artistic and theatrical troupes receive full support from the Serbian government, there is limited opportunity to travel, due to expense.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success of the delegation’s visit was due to the dedicated work of many. I would like to thank Mrs Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic, Speaker of the national assembly, and all our Serbian hosts. Meeting Madam Speaker proved particularly invaluable, as both Madam Speaker and the delegation were attending the following week’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        meeting in Geneva and both countries are members of the Twelve Plus geopolitical group at the IPU.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would especially like to thank Ambassador Claire Birgin, Melanie Davies and all the staff at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_embassy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian embassy
        </a>
        , who performed such an outstanding job in arranging such a comprehensive program of meetings, not just at the political and governmental levels but also with senior representatives from the educational, scientific, religious, artistic and cultural fields. To compile such a program in a relatively short time frame is testimony to their professional capabilities, dedication and enthusiasm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moving on to the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting, a large section of time was devoted to the panel discussions on the subjects before the three standing committees. I was honoured to deliver the draft report and introduce the panel discussion on the subject considered by the First Standing Committee: ‘Advancing nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and securing the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: the role of parliaments’. It was a lively panel discussion, with some 50 speakers representing many countries contributing to the debate and a number of others who had wished to contribute not being able to do so by the expiration of the discussion time. Considerable interest was generated by the draft report, with a range of issues being raised and many comments being made during the debate. These have been taken into consideration as the report has been redrafted and a preliminary resolution prepared for submission and finalisation at the next IPU meeting in April 2009, which, Mr Speaker, you will lead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of admitting Palestine to membership of the IPU and the necessity of amending IPU statutes and rules to permit this to occur had been postponed from the previous IPU meeting in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Town
        </a>
        . When the question to amend the IPU statutes and rules was put at the Geneva meeting, a rollcall vote was taken, with Australia voting to oppose the change. With the rule changes having been agreed to, the question to accept Palestine as a member passed on the voices. Australia also opposed this question, though a formal rollcall vote was not taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of Palestine is a highly complex one. The delegation had been briefed on Australia’s position regarding the situation with Palestine and the Middle-East and upheld this position in exercising its vote. The delegation considered that the proposed amendment of the IPU statutes and the admission of Palestine was highly inappropriate, and it was not consistent with the IPU’s own statutes, which state that the function of the IPU is to represent parliaments of sovereign nations. Although the amendment was argued to be specifically drafted to admit only Palestine, the delegation considered that it would set an unhelpful precedent because it may encourage other non-state entities to pursue similar representations and was clearly politically motivated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia’s position is to recognise Palestinian aspirations for statehood and to strongly support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian issue, based on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to a state of their own and Israel’s right to live in peace with secure borders. The delegation did not consider that the course of action being proposed through the IPU would advance this position or enhance the peace process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia maintains an active membership of both the Twelve Plus and Asia-Pacific geopolitical groups. In the Asia-Pacific group, Australia suggested that the group build on recent reforms by instituting an elected position of secretary for a period of three years, which would provide secretarial support and assistance to the chair—which rotates. We considered that this proposal would allow the development of skills, expertise and continuity. The proposal is being considered by the working group and will be further discussed during the next IPU meeting. The Australian delegation was delighted that Mr Zha Peixin of China assumed the chair of the Asia-Pacific Group, as he is also the Chair of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. The delegation has pledged its support and commitment to working closely with Mr Zha in advancing the interests of the Asia-Pacific Group within the IPU.
       </p>
       <p>
        This meeting elected a new IPU president for a three-year term. The Australian delegation gave strong support to the candidacy of His Excellency Agung Laksono, the Speaker of the Indonesian parliament. Although Mr Laksono was not successful at the election, he expressed deep appreciation for Australia’s support. The delegation was concerned at the position of the Pacific nations and some of our smaller Asian neighbours. In particular, representation at the IPU Assembly by Pacific countries was limited. Samoa was represented by a single delegate without any support, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        , who also had a single delegate, lost its voting rights. Timor-Leste is a newly emerging nation and is still finding its way as a participant in international institutions. The delegation had bilateral meetings with representatives of Timor-Leste to discuss issues of mutual interest. The delegation considers that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        must play a greater role in supporting the Pacific and neighbouring countries, especially to encourage these countries to engage with the IPU and to ensure their views are heard on the international stage.
       </p>

        Finally, I would like to thank Alison Purnell, our

         by leave—It was indeed a privilege and an honour to have been part of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Serbia" rel="nofollow">

         and to the 119th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva, Switzerland that took place between 4 and 18 October last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initially, I wish to record our appreciation for the many officials and advisers who provided their professional expertise and assistance to us and who made this delegation such a success. Ambassador Claire Birgin and Mrs Melanie Davies and the excellent staff of the Australian Embassy in Serbia provided sound advice and professional expertise.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Moore" rel="nofollow">
          Claire Moore
         </a>
         —for the excellent cooperative spirit in which this delegation was undertaken and which contributed in a positive manner to its success.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were several important reasons for an Australian delegation to Serbia. These included the need to establish formal relations with the new Serbian parliament, to have discussions on bilateral trade, to strengthen commercial relations and to discuss the possibility of bilateral healthcare agreements. We also wanted to expand the potential for increased cooperation in education between our two nations.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also wanted to take this opportunity to gain a better understanding of Serbia’s concerns about Kosovo’s independence and Serbia’s cooperation with the Hague tribunal, as well as Serbia’s reforms as it works towards membership of the European Union. We also sought to gain an appreciation of the situation of Serbian ethnic minorities, which include a large population of refugees from Croatia, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the Romana people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our visit was the very first Australian parliamentary delegation to the new Republic of Serbia, and we were able to participate in high-level meetings with the speaker and vice-speaker of the national assembly, with ministers, secretaries of state and various political leaders. The delegation was impressed with the efforts being made by the leaders of this vibrant young democracy to develop and enhance democratic traditions, and we considered that its efforts in this regard could perhaps be better acknowledged at an international level. Serbia’s ministers and political leaders are a new generation; they are young, they are energetic, they are professionally qualified, they are progressive and they are focused on a future for Serbia as a member of the European Union for its economic and social success. Having said that, I note that Serbia is also aware of the importance of regional cooperation and is actively involved in creating positive relationships with regional organisations and initiatives. Serbia certainly holds a position of strength within the Balkan region and is a key to stability in that region.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the main issues of concern at the time of our visit was the independence of Kosovo, and the delegation benefited from understanding the history of the relationship between these two countries. Serbia regards Kosovo as an integral part of its identity as a nation and is determined not to recognise Kosovo’s independence. However, in seeking to address this situation, Serbia has wisely committed to seek recourse through international legal institutions and procedures and, in so doing, is gaining well-deserved respect amongst the international family of nations.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the many high-level meetings with ministers and political leaders, the delegation pointed out that Australia would welcome the return of the Serbian Ambassador to Australia. Indeed, it is pleasing to note that shortly after our visit the Serbian ambassador returned to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report records three recommendations that were made by the delegation after this visit. They include the suggestion that through AusAID we sponsor exchange programs for parliamentary staff from the national assembly of Serbia and/or other government officials to assist in strengthening Serbia’s fledging parliamentary democracy. Another recommendation is that Australia facilitate opportunities for our tertiary education and research institutions for cooperation with research; exchanges of academic and research personnel; and graduate or postgraduate study in Australia. The third recommendation provides for support and assistance for cultural visits to Australia by Serbian artistic and theatrical troupes. We believe that the implementation of such recommendations will assist in providing for the development of a positive working relationship between our two nations and will achieve the objectives of the delegation to the mutual benefit of both countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delegation also attended the 119th assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva, assemblies which provide an opportunity for worldwide parliamentary dialogue on political, economic, social and cultural issues of international significance. There are now 154 members of the IPU and eight associate members. The IPU supports the work of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         and cooperates with regional interparliamentary organisations as well as with other like-minded international intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations. Australia is an active member of two geopolitical groups within the IPU: the Asia-Pacific Group and the Twelve Plus Group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of the highlights of our participation in the IPU in October last year, mention must include the fine leadership that was provided by the Chief Government Whip, the member for Chifley, not only in his capacity as delegation leader but especially in his role of co-rapporteur presenting the draft report to be considered by the first standing committee at the 120th assembly of the IPU in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa" rel="nofollow">
          Addis Ababa
         </a>
         in April this year. The topic of this paper is
         <i>
          Advancing nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and securing the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: the role of parliaments
         </i>
         . That topic is one in which Australia has had an abiding interest for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delegation report also makes a strong recommendation that the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs request the Centre for Democratic Institutions to investigate ways for Australia to encourage Pacific countries to become more involved in international fora, especially the IPU, and I note the recommendations that were already made by the Chief Government Whip in this regard. Again, I acknowledge the leadership of the member for Chifley and the positive contributions, spirit and work of the delegation by Senators Claire Moore and Judith Troeth. It was a privilege indeed to have been a member of this delegation, and I commend the report to the House.
