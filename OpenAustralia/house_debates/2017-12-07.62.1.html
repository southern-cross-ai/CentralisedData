        Last Friday I was lucky enough to be the substitute for the Minister for Defence, the Hon.

        . Two of our very reliable helicopters, called the Squirrel and the Seahawk, were retiring; this was their very last day. We had ceremonial divisionsâ€”if people haven't been to a ceremonial division for the Navy, it is absolutely spectacular. On this glorious day of Nowra weather, the white uniforms were shining out there, and the black shiny shoes, and the band was perfectly in time, as was the marching. What they were doing was just awe-inspiring.

        I was there to celebrate the Squirrel and the Seahawk retiring.

        , Captain Fiona Sneath, I said goodbye to these two most amazing helicopters. We now have the Romeos coming in, whose call sign appears to be 'taipan', so perhaps we will be moving away from Squirrels and Seahawks to something a little bit more stealthy, like the taipan. They are amazing helicopters. We've invested over half a billion dollars into this base with the helicopters, and I was so proud to be there with our personnel.
