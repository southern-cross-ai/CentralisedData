         I thank the honourable member for her question and note that, on the cessation of the Labor Party's Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, we took the money from that to place into further monitoring, especially, of heavy vehicles that you can see at crossroads.

         I also remind the honourable member that the coalition government has spent more on infrastructure than any Labor government—

           billions of dollars more than what the Labor government has spent. I understand, as we all do, the issues of road safety. Our road toll has been reducing. One would hope that we can reduce it more. I admit that we are not quite on target to what we set for the reduction of the toll, but it continues to come down.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also acknowledge that there was a substantial truck accident in Brisbane today—we still have to get the details on that. With regard to

            My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government's investment in Inland Rail will deliver economic prosperity across urban and regional Australia? Is he aware of any threats to the delivery of this game-changing infrastructure?

             I thank the member for his question and note the hard work that he has done for the people of Calare and for the city of Orange in helping to establish the Regional Investment Corporation, a multibillion dollar bank in Orange, developing Orange as our Chicago, as our area where rural commodities can be traded to become the epicentre of rural finance on the back of Paraway Finances, the national bank's major rural lending arm, and the

             department of agriculture. It's a vibrant city, and the member for Calare is doing more work every day to make that city even stronger and make the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">

             of New South Wales even stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, he is very interested in the Central West of New South Wales because one centre that will absolutely boom under this is Parkes. In Parkes—in the member for Riverina's seat—we will see that intermodal point, the expansion by reason of a connection from Melbourne through to Brisbane where the crossover from Sydney through to Perth happens. We're already seeing

             </a>
             investing $35 million into that area so that they can start building their infrastructure for those requirements. It's an $8.4 billion commitment. It's got 16,000 direct and indirect jobs. It will mean a $16 billion increase to our nation's
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             . With 262,000 tonnes of steel, the equivalent of five Harbour Bridges, this is being built in places such as Whyalla so that blue-collar workers in Whyalla can have a job. We believe in blue-collar workers. We still believe in labourers. We still believe in people actually having a job. We still believe that it's dignified to work in the coal industry and the steel industry. We are supporting them with this infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know that we have a vision that the Labor Party lack. However, they have an enthusiasm for it. We can see that from the member for Grayndler, who's been the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport from time immemorial. It was interesting on Monday, 12 February, and Tuesday, 13 February, that the member for Grayndler put out media releases saying, 'The Inland Rail goes through the seat of New England.' It doesn't. It doesn't go through the seat of New England. Then he also said, 'The Inland Rail doesn't go to the ports of Melbourne or Brisbane.' There are standard gauge lines to both the ports of Melbourne and Brisbane. Then he said, 'The Labor Party provided $300 million for the Inland Rail in the 2013 budget.' That's what he said. There's not a single mention of the Inland Rail in the 2013 budget. It was our election commitment. The best one was when he said, 'The Inland Rail was commenced by the former Labor government.' Why stop there? Why not say you're responsible for
