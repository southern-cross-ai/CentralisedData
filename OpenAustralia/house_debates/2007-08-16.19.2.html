        , and by reason of the urgent nature of the works, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Construction of staff apartments in the Australian Embassy compound, Baghdad, Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to undertake urgent construction of 12 residential apartments in the Australian Embassy compound in Baghdad, Iraq. The project will provide secure permanent accommodation for embassy staff currently accommodated on a temporary basis in the chancellery offices. The government places the highest priority on providing safe living conditions for staff posted to the embassy, and it is important that these works should go ahead without delay. The government fully supports the work of the Public Works Committee and it is unusual to seek parliamentary approval of a project without reference to the committee. However, given the situation in Baghdad and the urgent need to provide safe accommodation, this project should not be delayed by a referral to the committee. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $21 million. Subject to parliamentary approval the works will commence at once and are expected to be completed by mid-next year. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The government fully supports the work of the Public Works Committee and it is unusual to seek parliamentary approval of a project without reference to the committee. However, given the situation of the ABC Brisbane operations and the urgent need to provide a safe and effective working environment, this project should not be delayed by referral to the Public Works Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the reporting of an abnormal number of breast cancer cases among the female staff working at the ABC’s Toowong site in Brisbane, Queensland, the ABC set up an independent review panel to conduct a comprehensive investigation. The panel delivered a progress report in December 2006, and based on these findings the ABC decided it had no option but to vacate the Toowong site.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        is now operating from nine different sites across the city. This is dysfunctional and operationally limiting. Despite the ongoing stress, the 280 staff in Brisbane continue to work tirelessly and professionally to maintain the quality of ABC programs in what has been a challenging and often less than ideal working environment. The ABC board considered a wide range of accommodation options for a permanent home for the ABC in Brisbane and considered that a purpose-built ABC owned option was the most cost-effective solution. The preliminary estimated cost for the design, construction and building fit-out is $45 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the estimated duration of the project from the initial date of approval by the ABC board is 36 months, with occupation complete by mid-2010. The consequences of any delay for ABC staff and operations in Brisbane would be significant. It would undermine morale at a time when staff are keenly anticipating speedy action on the development of a new ABC centre. It would add to the cost of the current temporary accommodation measures and it would increase the risk of business continuity interruptions by extending the reliance on less than optimal technical communication, infrastructure and services. I commend the motion to the House.

        ’s air combat, air lift and aerospace operational support groups, Defence exercises and visiting units, and contributes to the defence of Australia’s regional interests. Defence has an ongoing requirement in maintaining a presence at RMAF Butterworth, and consequently a long-term requirement for facilities. The project reinforces Australia’s commitment to the five-power defence arrangements and will enable the Australian Defence Force to provide buildings which meet modern occupational health and safety requirements with improved efficiencies. The work will also enhance defence capability by enabling personnel mobility, morale, esprit de corps and training outcomes as well as personnel retention. The project proposes the construction of three new headquarters buildings, a combined armoury, installation of a sewage effluent treatment plant and the refurbishment of some existing facilities. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $23.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that the proposed works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval and further design, construction will start in early 2008 for completion in late 2009. On completion of the project, a small number of redundant buildings may be returned to the Malaysian Ministry of Defence. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         GST
        </a>
        . RAAF Base Pearce is a major military airbase in Western Australia. The base primarily supports flying training and additionally supports overseas deployments and transit operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the first redevelopment plan for RAAF Base Pearce and it seeks to address the aged, substandard and dysfunctional infrastructure and facilities which do not comply with current standards. It will enhance defence capability by enabling personnel mobility, morale, esprit de corps, training outcomes, attraction and retention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The redevelopment project will involve replacement of base-wide engineering services, a new fuel farm, a new quality control centre, a new combined mess, an upgrade to the air movements terminal, an upgrade to the training aircraft maintenance hangar, a new noise attenuated engine run-up facility for the resident training aircraft, new live-in accommodation for cadet pilots and the demolition of redundant facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works has recommended that these works proceed, subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, the further design and construction will commence in late 2007, and it is anticipated to be completed by mid-2011.

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Health and Ageing proposes to undertake the fit-out of new leased premises to be constructed on a redeveloped site at the Woden Town Centre,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . The estimated total capital cost of the fit-out is $67 million, with the fit-out construction to be integrated with the base building. The proposed new building is to be located adjacent to Scarborough House, Health’s head office, at the northern end of the pedestrian precinct in the Woden Town Centre. Its close proximity to Scarborough House will strengthen links between all areas of the department and enhance operational efficiencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The site will comprise the existing Sirius Building and Fishburn House sites on Furzer Street, Woden. The two buildings are to be demolished and replaced by new buildings that will deliver approximately 44,500 square metres of flexible, modern office accommodation and meet the requirements of the Australian government’s

       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works recommended that the proposed work should proceed, subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Health and Ageing accepts and will implement those recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, work is proposed to commence in November this year, with practical completion of the new building scheduled for early 2010. As a result, Health expects to occupy the building from February 2010. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend this motion to the House.
