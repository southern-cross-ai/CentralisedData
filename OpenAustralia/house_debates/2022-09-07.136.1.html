        Before I begin I would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land we are meeting on, the Ngunnawal people. I would also like to acknowledge and welcome other Aboriginal and

        people who are present and pay respects to the Whadjuk and Noongar nation, the traditional custodians of my electorate in Pearce. The electorate is home to a large group of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        people who implement strategic plans to not only further reconciliation but provide education about First Nations history and culture in Pearce and work towards supporting the youth in the area.

        Maar Koodjal is a grassroots Aboriginal organisation operated by a proud First Nations man, Mr Dennis Simmons. Dennis is a good friend of mine, and I see him constantly devoting his time to helping others, especially First Nations youth. I have known Dennis for many years, and his work is outstanding and inspiring. Maar Koodjal values are guided by ecology, equality, reconciliation, spirit and integrity. Strong fundamental links exist between our communities and thus the need for climate justice, health justice and safe climate health. Maar Koodjal works with Aboriginal people, low-income communities, corporates, the arts sector and other diverse peoples connected to the relevant cultural projects. Maar Koodjal runs specialised programs that are targeted to everyone in the community, with a focus on schools. Local schools regularly visit the

        centre in Yanchep details the stories of the traditional custodians of the land and provides a teaching and learning space for all to use. It depicts traditional drawings and storytelling and is a communal space with traditional seating, perfect for yarning circles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dennis's latest venture is a pilot project called On Country Mental Health which is needed to support the wider communityâ€”specifically young people on their journey to learning about culture and about themselves. It will teach them an appreciation of the land and help young people who may be struggling to find their way, no matter what background they come from. Dennis is an outstanding mentor and friend to many, who works incredibly hard to support his community and his vision for Maar Koodjal. I don't think Dennis ever sleeps. I'm in absolute awe of his dedication to his community and his commitment to making this world a better place for everybody.
