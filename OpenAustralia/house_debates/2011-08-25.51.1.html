       <p>
        On Monday we saw a peaceful protest on the lawns of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . People came from all over Australia to display their anger and disgust at the way they have been treated by this government. How were these people treated—these good, hardworking people of Australia? They were ignored by the Prime Minister. They were ignored by the cabinet. They were insulted by the Leader of the House. They were insulted by the Minister for Trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why are these people angry? I will tell you why. These people are angry because they have been deserted. Where are the people on this side of the House who were elected by funds raised by the unions—by the sweat of the workers, like the member for Maribyrnong on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
         AWU
        </a>
        and the member for Corio for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers Union
        </a>
        ? All that effort! These people put these members in there to look after the interests of the workers, and they have been sold out to the elite Greens agenda. They have been sold out to the people behind me—the Greens and the Independents—and deserted by this government.

          The Leader of the House will stop and talk in the chamber but not go out to the front and speak to the people of Australia as they come onto the lawns expecting a decent hearing. In 1985
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">

          , but would this Prime Minister go out to speak to the people on Monday? They were ignored.

           I take off from where the previous speaker finished. I was appalled by the arrogance and the contempt shown by the Leader of the House, who described this week's rally as a 'convoy of no consequence'. Then we had the Leader of the Greens, the partner in this government, who went further. He depicted the protesters as 'moaners and a general smorgasbord of whingers'. That is a bit rich coming from a professional protestor like the Leader of the Greens. I will say this to those opposite: lose the arrogant attitude. Show some respect and be very careful. The moaners and the whingers—those people of no consequence you talk about—will have their day. Start showing them some respect.
