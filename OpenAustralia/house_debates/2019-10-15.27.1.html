        I would like to take this opportunity to give a shout-out to the Pimpama Men's Shed, one of the great local community groups in my electorate of Forde. I wish to thank

        , who has recently retired as the shed's manager, and welcome Bob Lander to the interim manager position. Some might say it's just any old shed in the park, but to the members of the shed it's a refuge and place to call their own. Pimpama Men's Shed continues to enjoy strong membership and support from locals and is very active in giving back to our local community. Most recently, members John and Col finished the window frames for a project at the Pimpama State School and Max and Dave restored a 100-year-old gramophone, and four new buddy benches were completed, which also go to Pimpama State School. They're proudly supported by

I'm always amazed by the Pimpama Men's Shed and its willingness to get involved in community activities right across our local community in the northern part of the
