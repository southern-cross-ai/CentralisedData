        Over the past couple of weeks I have had the opportunity to meet with many community groups within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        electorate. I would like to take this opportunity today to speak about and congratulate the work of one of those groups. I had the pleasure to meet with ladies from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probus_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Probus Club
        </a>
        of Elanora at their August meeting held at the Currumbin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I was warmly greeted by Margaret Eley, who is responsible for coordinating guest speakers for the club, and by their President, Josie Taylor. I have to say that my attention was immediately caught by a beautiful quilt that will be raffled in the near future. It did of course lead to a discussion about the fun and friendship offered and gained by being part of quilting groups and groups of that nature.

        The Elanora Probus Club makes a great contribution to the community within my electorate. This not-for-profit organisation serves the local retiree community by providing opportunities to increase wellbeing, both mentally and physically. For local retirees, the Elanora Probus Club offers a social environment where new friendships can be formed within a fun and engaging environment. Members are introduced to retirees from their local community, allowing many new friendships to form. The club also provides the opportunity to meet experts from a range of different fields, including travel, research, history, ancestry and much more. I congratulate and commend the ladies from the Elanora Probus Club on their work. I certainly enjoyed meeting with them.
