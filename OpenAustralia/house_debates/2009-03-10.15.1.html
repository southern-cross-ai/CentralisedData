        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that over the course of the previous government, 2.2 million new jobs were created in Australia. I ask the Treasurer if he could advise the House of the total number of new jobs he expects to be created in Australia over the course of this parliamentary term.

         I thank the member for his question. All I can say is that we can say to the Australian people that, in the middle of a global recession, we have done everything we possibly can to support employment in the Australian economy. I can say that truthfully and I can say that while I look them straight in the eye. Those opposite cannot answer that question, because they have not been in favour of one single measure which has supported employment in the Australian economy in the last 12 months. Their solution is to sit, to wait and to see, as the global recession washes its way through this country. We will do everything within our power through economic stimulus, through stabilisation of the financial—

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is relevance. He was asked a specific question. If he does not have a figure, he should say so.

            The assertion by the shadow Assistant Treasurer is just more game playing from those opposite to cover up their embarrassment for the fact that they do not have an alternative policy proposition to put to the Australian people about supporting employment and supporting Australian business. We do. We have specific propositions that we have put forward through our Economic Security Strategy and also through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. We just heard from the Minister for Housing the impact that the first home owner boost is having out there right now on jobs in the Australian economy—a measure which those opposite do not support. So we can subtract all of those jobs that have been created in the first home owners grant flow-through—we can subtract all of those from any record they might have had. What we are getting here is the fact that those opposite do not have a policy alternative. We do.

               It is called an Economic Security Strategy, a Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which will support employment in the Australian economy. The opposition have no plan for the future; they simply have a plan for finding fault. We on this side of the House have a positive alternative, and we will continue to support Australian business and Australian jobs.
