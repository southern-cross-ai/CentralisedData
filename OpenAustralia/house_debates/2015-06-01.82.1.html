        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I remind the minister that the government, through Operation Sovereign Borders, has stopped the boats, ended the deaths at sea and regained control of Australia's borders. Will the minister inform the House of the effect of the government's successful border protection policies on this year's budget?

         I thank the member for Macquarie, and I acknowledge her hard work as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. She is a great local member. She is a very strong voice for Macquarie in this place on matters relating to migration and national security. In this year's budget in this portfolio we were able to give back $500 million to the budget so that we can pay for the measures associated with childcare increases in the support for parents with kids; small business measures; measures for tightening biometric security at our borders; and a number of other budget measures, which of course were not possible when Labor were in power, because in this portfolio they had an $11 billion blowout because 52,000 people came on 800 boats. Not only is it a budget saving but, more importantly, there are the 1,200 people who drowned at sea under Labor. That death and carnage has now stopped under this government because we have been able to stop the boats. We have been able to turn back boats where it is safe to do so. At the

                I take it as a heavy blow. The point of all of this is that, if you look at the incompetence that prevailed when Labor was last in government, it still sits on that front bench. It has been 300 days since we have had a successful people-smuggling venture come to this country—300 days under Operation Sovereign Borders. The member for Watson could only manage six days. He tied, of course, with the member for Gorton, Mr O'Connor; he had six days as minister—a long period of six days between boat arrivals. A massive achievement, trumped of course by the member for McMahon, who was clearly an overachiever in the Labor government—it was 23 days. While he was writing his book about the success of Fuelwatch and Grocery Watch, he managed to get through 23 days with no boat arrivals. The point of all of this is that Labor ripped apart the economy when they were in government. They destroyed border security. If they are re-elected at the next election they will do it all again.
