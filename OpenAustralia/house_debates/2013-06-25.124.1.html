       <p>
        On 15 March this year I attended a unique event. It was a book launch and an art show. The book that was launched was
        <i>
         Who Runs Your House:
        </i>
        <i>
         T
        </i>
        <i>
         he
        </i>
        <i>
         K
        </i>
        <i>
         ids
        </i>
        <i>
         O
        </i>
        <i>
         r
        </i>
        <i>
         Y
        </i>
        <i>
         ou?
        </i>
        It was written by Karen Phillip. The art show was a collection of artworks by her husband, Wayne Phillip. I have to say that I left that event with a book in hand and a painting under my arm, because it was a wonderful display by a creative couple.
       </p>
       <p>
        Karen's book, which is her first, is about who runs a houseâ€”the parents or the kids? It was written for parents who desire or need no-nonsense advice on how to raise their children. Karen is a registered family disputes practitioner. She has a master's as a counsellor, with a major in family therapy, and has been a family therapist for nearly two decades. She is the mother of three children and the stepmother of another three. Her book is based on her knowledge as a counsellor of the problems that people come to her with about their children and about putting in place boundaries and practices that give some control to the parents as opposed to the children. She emphasises how important it is to put in place correct boundaries and rules. The book also has a lot of good advice on how to speak to children in a way that is going to lead to the resolution of a problem rather than conflict and how to better direct children towards making the right choice, giving them direction and leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a very special evening. There were a lot of people present and Karen was able to share with those present her thoughts based on her experience as a counsellor and a parent. It was good advice and it is certainly worth a read. So if anyone sees the book in the bookshop,
        <i>
         Who Runs Your House: the Kids or You
        </i>
        , I recommend that you pick it up and, if you can see a Wayne Phillip painting, it is certainly worth buying.
