        My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of steps the government is taking to recognise the importance of grandparents in families affected by separation?

         I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I think all members of the House acknowledge her interest particularly in family law issues and the role of grandparents in families affected by separation. I am sure she and other members of the parliament will be interested in the recent research of the Institute of Family Studies which confirms the importance of grandparents in caring for children. This role can be even more crucial in cases where there is separation. Grandparents can exercise a moderating and calming influence at times of great stress and uncertainty for families.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is interested in these matters because we are undertaking some of the most significant reforms to the family law system in some 30 years. These proposed changes to the family law system will see the role of grandparents better taken into consideration when family breakdown occurs. Parents will be encouraged to consider time spent with grandparents when developing a parenting plan. If the matter proceeds to court, the court will need to specifically consider the importance to the child of the relationship with grandparents.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is also investing $397 million over four years to provide resources to help families, including with the establishment of 65 family relationship centres over time across Australia. These centres are intended to be family-friendly places where grandparents will be welcomed and supported if they are affected by the separation of their children.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will also be providing funding to legal aid commissions to enable them to provide an expanded dispute resolution process to grandparents seeking contact with their grandchildren. This government recognises the valuable contribution of grandparents to childrenâ€™s lives and we are determined to assist them in making that contribution.
