        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Personnel. Minister, I refer to the Morris government's budget commitment to additional veterans' wellbeing centres in Tasmania and South-East Queensland. Can the minister update the House on how our budget is helping veterans and their families to access the services that they need in their own communities?

         I thank the member for Braddon not only for his service to our nation in uniform but also for the work he's been doing in his community in the north-west of Tasmania. I want to congratulate the member for Braddon on the work he's been doing to engage with veterans and their families through the north-west veterans group. I had the chance to visit with the member just 10 days ago. I've got to say, I'm very impressed by the way they're working in partnership to outreach throughout the more remote parts of Tasmania to deliver services to veterans and their families. I also had the opportunity on that visit to catch up with the member for Bass in Launceston and see the work the Launceston
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         is doing to support our veterans in their own communities. The member for Braddon asked me about the six wellbeing centres which were announced as part of the 2019 election campaign. I must say, we are delivering on those right across the country.
        </p>

         Just to update the House, in Perth, the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         RSL, opened in November last year. I had the pleasure of visiting this facility just a month or so ago. It is providing a range of services, including health services, to our veterans in Western Australia. In Adelaide, the Veteran Wellbeing Centre opened in April within the site of the former Repat General Hospital. The member for Boothby was instrumental in delivering that service for her community. The Oasis Townsville is in its final stages of completion. I had the pleasure of joining the member for Herbert as we toured that facility only a few weeks ago. There are a number of interim facilities also underway in Nowra. I know it has the support of the local member. In Darwin there's a facility, Mates4Mates, that's already working there. Also, in Wodonga, the Victorian RSL is working in partnership with the community to deliver services in that region. These services are making a real difference already. They're helping to save lives in those communities. One veteran said of the Darwin service: 'It's great to know Mates4Mates are here. I left the Navy 27 years ago and have really missed the camaraderie of the forces. I love that there are activities out there that I can go to and be around ex- and current-serving members again.'
        </p>
        <p>
         In the most recent budget, the Morrison-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">
          McCormack
         </a>
         government announced a commitment to expand the network of wellbeing centres to include Tasmania and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          South East Queensland
         </a>
         . That federal budget announcement for South East Queensland and Tasmania is very important, because this is not about Canberra. It's not about bureaucrats dictating solutions to local communities or dictating solutions to our veterans. This is about working with local communities to seek local solutions. Each of these wellbeing centres or networks will respond to local needs and deliver services on the ground to those communities when and where they're needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we want to do is work in partnership with our communities to build on the excellent work they are already doing to support our veterans and their families. There are so many people every day out there saving lives, working with our veterans community, and we're very proud of the services they're delivering. This is part of the ongoing commitment of the government to improve the health and wellbeing of our military families right across the nation. It is saving lives. It is making a difference. It's an excellent program.
