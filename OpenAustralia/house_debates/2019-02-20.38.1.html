        What a week we've had for hypocrisy from this government again! We have heard in estimates from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        that not once but twice the former Minister for Jobs and Innovation and the former Minister for Justice have refused to be interviewed by the

They use whatever they can to demonise their political opponents and to demonise unions, but are not willing to step up and respect the rule of law. It's time this government acted and took account of this. It's time these ministers resigned. It's time—
