        If we look around the chamber, many of us have started to wear yellow ribbons. These are very important symbols of recognising that September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This month was first proclaimed in 2010 by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        President Obama, and it has since become a global initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        We wear gold ribbons to raise awareness about this incredibly important month, where we recognise those young people in our community who are suffering from childhood cancer or have passed away from childhood cancer. It is pleasing to see so many members and senators starting to wear them. For those who have not got a gold ribbon, look into getting one because it is an important month.

        The Kids Cancer Project here in Australia works hard to help fight the scourge of cancer. It funds research to help end childhood cancer and has been doing so since 1993. According to the Kids Cancer Project, three families will hear the words 'your child has cancer' every day. There are 950 children diagnosed with cancer in Australia every year.

        I would like to recognise Erin, who has unfortunately passed away at the age of 14. But before her death, she advocated on behalf of other children around the world; she really shone a light on this terrible scourge. She urged us to continue to address this issue in this parliament.
