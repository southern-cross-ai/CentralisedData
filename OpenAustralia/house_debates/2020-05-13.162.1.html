       <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has had some unexpected outcomes in my electorate. Many people in Mallee have made the most of social distancing restrictions by refurbishing gardens, sheds, homes and business sites. When we emerge from this lockdown, I think our community assets will be in far better shape than when we entered it. But I want to talk this morning about another refurbishment program, which is exciting for the agricultural show societies in Mallee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Normally there are around 580 agricultural shows across Australia each year. These shows contribute around $965 million to the economy, and nearly six million Australians attend. Agricultural shows are a yearly highlight in Mallee, and, like so many important events in 2020, they have been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. I am thrilled today to speak about funding which Minister Littleproud and I have announced this week for three agricultural shows in my electorate through the Commonwealth's Regional Agricultural Show Development Grants Program. Just over $1 million has been allocated to the Mallee towns of Cohuna, Horsham and Natimuk to help show societies refurbish their showgrounds and facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The annual agricultural show is always a big event, and, thanks to this grant, next year's will be even better. All three show society recipients were very excited to receive the good news this week.

        told me that the Cohuna and District Agricultural, Pastoral and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticultural_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Horticultural Society
        </a>
        will be using their $475,000 to replace the Morton Garner Pavilion at the Cohuna Recreation Reserve. Andrea Cross, from the Horsham Agricultural Society, told me her team will be utilising their $125,000 to undertake works to refurbish the Maydale Pavilion and build a disabled toilet at the Horsham Showgrounds. When I spoke to Judith Bysouth from the Natimuk Agricultural and Pastoral Society, she said their $499,000 will be used to upgrade the multipurpose pavilion at Natimuk Showground, including the development of a grain arcade exhibit which showcases regional farming.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agricultural shows are the heart and soul of our regional communities. They bring and keep communities together; bridge the divide between country and city; and provide a key injection into the local economy. Upgrading show facilities means more visitors to these regional events, more local employment and more purchases for local businesses. The grants will benefit both agricultural show societies and their regional communities. Once again I congratulate the Cohuna, Horsham and Natimuk show societies for their award-winning submissions and I look forward to attending these shows next year and seeing their completed works.
