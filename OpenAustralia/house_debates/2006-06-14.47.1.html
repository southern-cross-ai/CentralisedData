        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of any evidence that the economy will suffer if Australian workers lose the freedom of choice currently available to them under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices

        ? Are there any alternative views, and how do they compare with government policies?

         Not only am I aware of the damage that would be done by taking away Australian workplace agreements but so is the Australian Mines and Metals Association, an association that represents a section of the Australian economy which, according to the member for Perth—who is the spokesman for the Labor Party on these matters—is responsible for the boom economic conditions we are experiencing particularly in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . According to this association, which represents the mining industry, removing workplace agreements would cost $6.6 billion a year. That is the cost to the mining industry. This is not my figure; it is not the figure of the ABS; it is the figure of the Australian Mines and Metals Association.

                   This is field evidence. This is evidence from people who know the industry. They know the value of workplace agreements. They know the poison that returning to collective agreements would represent for their industry. I say again that the plan of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to workplace agreements is a direct attack on aspirational Australia. It is a direct attack on the success stories of Australian industry. It is a direct attack on our export industries. As the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition ought to be ashamed that it is a direct attack on the prosperity of the great state of Western Australia.

                    My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the case of Emily Connor. Is the Prime Minister aware that until March this year Emily had been employed for five years as a child-care worker at the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinky_Bill" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    child care centre in Canberra? Is the Prime Minister also aware that, two days after the government’s industrial relations legislation came into effect, Emily was called to her boss’s office, told her services were no longer required and given no reason for her dismissal? Isn’t it the case that Emily asked to say goodbye to the children in her care? She was told that if she did not leave in 10 minutes the police would be contacted to escort her from the premises. Prime Minister, what do you say to Emily, who now has no protection against such unfair and unconscionable treatment in the workplace?

                        of individual cases such as that. Thousands of people leave employment and gain employment all over Australia every week. But I am aware, and the Leader of the Opposition should be aware, of an article in the

                        this morning written by an academic by the name of Don Harding that makes the point that, on a preliminary examination of the early figures on the behaviour of the workforce since the introduction of the new industrial relations legislation, there is absolutely no evidence of the mass sackings of which the Labor Party is so ready to speak. Indeed, the preliminary indications are that the employment outlook has actually got better since the

                        </a>
                        legislation was introduced. I know that will be intensely disappointing to the Leader of the Opposition, because he has been hoping and praying for a deterioration in the figures. He always wants bad economic news in the hope that he can use it in propaganda against this government.

                       <p>
                        I do not know the circumstances of that individual. In the question of a similar kind that he asked me yesterday, he did not disclose to the House the fact that the lady to whom he referred was entitled to bring a claim for unlawful dismissal. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to get up in this House and deny any knowledge that she was bringing a claim for unlawful dismissal, because the source of the information that came to me was a union. I find it hard to believe that, if I can find out from the union, the Leader of the Opposition, who does everything they want, could not also find out from the union.

They are the sorts of people that the Labor Party wants to do down. They are the sorts of people that the Labor Party wants to take a stick to. They are the sorts of people that are responsible for this extraordinary growth in our resource sector. The Labor Party is happy all the time to say, ‘The only reason the country is doing well is that we have a resources boom.’ That is an incomplete, invalid proposition. It is a bit odd if you say: ‘The reason we are prosperous is that we have a resources boom. So what we, the Labor Party will do, is destroy the living conditions of those who are contributing to the resources boom.’ It is a very odd kind of argument.
