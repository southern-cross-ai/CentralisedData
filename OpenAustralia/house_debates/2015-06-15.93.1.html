        My question is to the Prime Minister. By failing to deny reports that criminal people smugglers could be paid
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        $30,000 if they make it to an Australian vessel, isn't the government providing a cash incentive for these dangerous voyages to take place?

         No, we are not. Again I contrast what this government has done with what members opposite did when they were in government. We have stopped the boats; members opposite started up the boats. Under members opposite there were almost 1,000 boats, there were more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, there were more than 1,000 deaths at sea and there was more than $11 billion in border protection budget blow-outs. Under members opposite, at $10,000 per person, some half a billion dollars found its way into the pockets of the people smugglers.
        </p>

         There are a lot of unemployed people smugglers in Indonesia—a lot of people who were put into business by members opposite—thanks to this government, so I am very happy to contrast this government's record when it comes to border protection with the record of members opposite. Members opposite created rivers of gold into the pockets of the people smugglers of Indonesia, and I want the Australian people to know it has all stopped under this government. I have concluded the answer.
