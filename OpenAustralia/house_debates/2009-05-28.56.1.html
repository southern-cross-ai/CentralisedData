        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of stimulating the economy through direct investment in infrastructure so we can support jobs in local communities?

         I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question. There are something like 107 projects underway in Makin, something like 102 school projects in Makin, and they are supporting jobs and supporting small business in Adelaide. They are key parts of our nation-building plan for recovery. But, of course, not one of those 107 projects would go ahead if those opposite were in government—not one. These vital jobs, this vital support for business, would not be there and the consequence for those local communities would be higher unemployment and more business failures. It is really that simple. And, of course, that is why those opposite are so embarrassed about the fact that they do not have an alternative fiscal policy, which is why we are getting this scare campaign on deficit and debt.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have put in place through the budget an historic investment in essential infrastructure—road, rail, port—to expand the productive capacity of our nation. Something like 70 per cent of our stimulus is invested in infrastructure, which of course is being opposed by the opposition here, but it is vital in supporting jobs today. Without the government’s investment, up to 210,000 Australians would be out of work. We should think about that for a moment. That is the logical consequence of their position.
        </p>
        <p>
         They are our fellow Australians. They are our neighbours; they are our family members; they are our workmates. Those opposite should seriously consider the unsustainability of their position in this House, as has been demonstrated day after day by the Prime Minister and other ministers, because this stimulus through investment in infrastructure is absolutely vital to support jobs. But I suspect there is only one job that the Leader of the Opposition is worried about here, and that is his. Only one job.

           Well, it is the truth. The only job he is worried about is his own job. He is not worried about the jobs of Australians because he does not walk in the same shopping aisles as average Australians. He certainly does not do that, because why does he vote against stimulus? If he understood the impact of his decisions to oppose these measures, why does he vote against stimulus? Because he is chronically out of touch with the needs of the Australian economy and chronically out of touch with the need to support jobs in our community. The only job he is worried about is his own. Naked political opportunism—that is what rules the day. We on this side of the House will go on supporting jobs—
