        Area 441 local police coordinator Detective Brevet Sergeant Alison Klingberg, whose role with area 441 volunteers has been invaluable, received a 10-year service certificate and was singled out for special praise by her group. Ray Jensen, one of the original volunteers, spoke of the group's founding and the early days of its work. Several other speakers, including Police Commissioner Mal Hyde and Jack Snelling, shared their perspectives on the importance of the work of Neighbourhood Watch volunteers in South Australia. I congratulate all those people who were recognised on the night with the different awards, and I extend to them my personal thanks for what they do. I particularly acknowledge the tireless work of Bob and Aileen Eldridge, who for many years have taken on the responsibilities of area coordinator and secretary. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of all the Neighbourhood Watch groups in South Australia, and particularly those within my electorate of Makin, whose work I am personally familiar with.
       </p>

        These volunteers devote considerable time and effort to ensuring that we all live in a safer community by helping reduce crime in their respective local neighbourhoods. Police crime statistics show a very clear pattern of reduced crime in areas where active Neighbourhood Watch groups exist. The groups have also become an excellent community reference group and advocates on other matters which affect their local area. I frequently attend the Neighbourhood Watch groups in my electorate and I am very familiar with what they do. I commend the tireless work of Neighbourhood Watch volunteers, who quietly go about organising fundraising activities and community information days and regularly delivering newsletters to their residents.
