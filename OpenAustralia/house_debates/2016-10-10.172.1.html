       <p>
        Last Friday was a very emotional day for the people of Broadmeadows in my electorate, as it marked the end of 91 years of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Ford Australia
        </a>
        manufacturing cars in Australia. Ford has been a major employer in Broadmeadows and other suburbs in Melbourne's north since it was established in 1959. Generations of different migration waves were reflected in the composition of the Ford factory floor. Many families in Calwell built their new Australian lives on the basis of jobs at Ford. They learnt English, they developed working skills, they made lifelong friendships and they experienced a sense of pride and achievement in their work. They even had their children cared for at the on-site, multicultural childcare centre, which was an innovation ahead of its time.
       </p>
       <p>
        While some staff will continue to have jobs in Ford's engineering and design centres in Broadmeadows, Geelong and Lara, up to a third of Ford workers will struggle to find other jobs. Part of the challenge is that there is a lack of local manufacturing jobs altogether. Another challenge is that, for many of the workers, English is a second or even a third language and it will be difficult, at a very difficult period, for the transition for the entire community.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have much to be hopeful about in Broadmeadows, including a burgeoning food-manufacturing sector and a dedicated economic development team at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Hume" rel="nofollow">
         City of Hume
        </a>
        . We have a community of cultural diversity, multilingualism and many skills and qualifications. Broadmeadows has moved far beyond a one-company town, but there is no doubt that the closure of an iconic employer like Ford has made and will continue to make a huge impact upon our community.

         I thank the member for Calwell, and I can identify with everything she just said.
