        <p>
         I can advise the House that, broadly, with one or two issues that we wish to identify, the opposition is in support of these changes to standing committees, and we have certainly been working with the government and with the crossbench on these changes, and one of the consequences of them is to provide some greater roles for the crossbench in the committee process. I do want to note two specific issues, one of which is that there is no longer to be any reference to 'cities' in the title of the standing committee on infrastructure, so 'cities' has disappeared from the title of this committee and, indeed, from the minister's title. It does raise the question of the level of commitment of this government to the cities agenda. Our government had a very strong agenda when it came to cities, but we seem to be moving away from a commitment to cities policy. So I do note that we no longer have a minister for cities. We no longer seem to have a committee that has any investigation in relation to cities. The opposition does note that with concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we also note with concern is that two committees have been abolished, and one of those is the Joint
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Standing Committee
         </a>
         on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         . That is pretty significant. Our government had a very strong commitment to northern Australia, and this government has failed to re-establish the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. That is a matter of concern to the Liberal Party and to the National Party, and I believe that the Leader of the Nationals wishes to speak about that.

          I find it quite extraordinary that one of the first acts of this new government in this new parliament is to abolish the Joint
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Standing Committee
          </a>
          on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Australia
          </a>
          , disenfranchising 1.3 million Australians. Their voice to this parliament is being removed through a bipartisan committee that was about the growth of northern Australia, where we have an extra $2 billion investment pipeline through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, taking it to a $7 billion investment pipeline, because there is investment confidence in northern Australia. But the investment signals on northern Australia to take away from this government today are that they aren't interested in them anymore. Every Australian should have the opportunity to have their voice heard in this parliament through important committee work, and this government, which trumpeted that it would govern for every Australian, has now turned its back on 1.3 million Australians. But, more importantly, they have turned their backs on over 200,000
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations
          </a>
          people who have the opportunity to develop their country, to develop northern Australia, to take northern Australia to a level we have not seen before. So I say to those opposite: you have to govern for every Australian. The opportunity not just for northern Australia but for this great country is in the north. You should remember that, and you should engage that in a constructive way.

            On right of reply, and taking the issues that have just been raised into account, I draw members' attention to the fact that the regional Australian issues are still able to be dealt with through the appropriate committee. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Australia
            </a>

             First Nations
            </a>
            issues and, as the members are aware, there are negotiations happening with the Senate right now in setting up a specific First Nations joint committee that will be able to deal with all of those issues.
