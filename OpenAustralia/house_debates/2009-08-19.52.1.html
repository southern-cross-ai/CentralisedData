        My question is to the Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer of his own words in this place, and I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … we had to set about putting some fairness into the taxation system. We had to set about taxing fringe benefits. We had to set about bringing in a capital gains tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the Treasurer has now admitted that cabinet is considering tax increases, and not just the Henry review, does the Treasurer still believe that fairness in the tax system is new taxes like capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax?

         That question from the shadow Treasurer just demonstrates that what we have got over that side of the House is a leaderless rabble that do not whether they are coming or going. We have a comprehensive review, through Dr Henry, of the tax system. Their only contribution to this debate is to come into this House and try and whip up a fear campaign, and they want to do that on the day when we have one of the most significant projects in Australia’s history going forward, worth something like $50 billion. Of course the misjudgement or the lack of judgment of the Liberal Party, and in particular the shadow minister, has been on display in our discussion about the importance of today because everyone in this House should be celebrating what is going on with this project—the enormous investment, jobs and prosperity that it will bring this country beyond the global recession.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the shadow Treasurer to go out in his doorstop interview this morning and compare this project to shopping for the weekly groceries at Woolworths or Coles is simply outrageous, and it shows what a lack of judgment the Liberal Party have and how they are only interested in scoring political points. They are not interested in the national interest. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say this morning when he was at the doorstop interview. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I’m always prepared to buy something from a vendor—
        </p>
        <p>
         He goes on to ask whether that means you are friends with them:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … When you go shopping do you develop a friendship with a Woolies person or a Coles person?
        </p>
        <p>
         This is what he said in answer to a question about Gorgon.

           If the shadow Treasurer thinks that Gorgon bears some relationship to shopping for bread and milk at Woolies or Coles then what that demonstrates is a massive lack of judgment. We came into this House yesterday and described those opposite as masters of misjudgement. It has been demonstrated time and time again.

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Treasurer a simple question about tax increases considered by the government, including previous statements on fringe benefits and capital gains tax. I would ask you to bring the Treasurer back to reality.
