        Like many of us, I attended a Vietnam Veterans' Day memorial ceremony at the

        was Australia's longest military engagement in the 20th century and started with the training unit, but it went through to full battle operations. By the time the war had ended, 60,000 Australian service men and women had served. Tragically, 521 of them died and 3,000 were wounded. Today, many of those veterans still carry the mental burdens, as well as the physical problems, that they inherited as a result of their service. They've relied on the Vietnam Veterans' Association, the RSL,

        . On the morning of 14 February, he was unfortunately killed by a landmine. Second Lieutenant Kerry Patrick Rinkin, aged 21, also of Taree, was a bank clerk who graduated from the Officer Training Unit at Scheyville, six months after call-up, in June 1965. He was a platoon commander and transferred to the regular Army midway through his national service in 1966. He served with the 5th

        on 22 May 1969. Lance Corporal Michael Paul White, another young man in his prime at age 20, was born in Cronulla but was from Taree when he entered service. He followed his two older brothers into service and was wounded, also in Bien Hoa Province, on 1 November 1969 and died 24 days later. Last of all, I mention Private Arthur John Gibson, aged 27 of Taree, who also served and died. Thank you.
