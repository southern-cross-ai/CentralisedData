        Afterlee Public School has recently celebrated their 100th birthday. Ex-students of all ages came together, including Bob O'Neill, who went to the school between 1945 and 1957. Bob spoke with current students about what school was like back in his day. There were only two cars in the area back then and no buses. He said that if you couldn't walk or ride there, they didn't go to school. Bob's six children also went to Afterlee school; his grandchildren go there and he thinks his great-grandchildren will go to the school too. This is just one example of the spirit that exists within the Afterlee school community.

        I'd like to recognise the centenary committee, who began planning this event three years ago: Wendy Carter, Michelle Murphy, Caroline Fisher, Bob and Iris O'Neill, Jenny Kitchener,

        I am always in awe of the selfless acts of local heroes that come to the aid of people in my community. Lachlan Metcalf, Utah Chilcott and

        when they noticed a small boat had overturned. The occupants, a father and son, aged 83 and 60, were thrown into the sea and immediately became entangled in fishing line and ropes. Lachlan, Utah and George quickly sped to the accident to offer assistance to the struggling men. Sean Sauers and his sons, Hayden and Luke, were also out and saw the emergency unfold. They, too, raced to offer assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once—and it was a very difficult operation—the two men were freed from the mess of fishing lines and ropes, including the anchor rope, the rescue party got them into the respective rescue boats and they were transported back to shore. By this time, the emergency services had been notified. The Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service was there ready to treat the two patients, who were then transported to

       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank Lachlan, Utah, George, Sean, Hayden and Luke for their outstanding efforts. I'd also like to thank all the first responders that were involved, the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service and Marine Rescue Evans Head. There were also members of the ambulance service, police and the fire brigade who all came together to offer assistance.
