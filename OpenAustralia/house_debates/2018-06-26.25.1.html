        I rise to pay tribute and to acknowledge the dedicated service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Fire_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Country Fire Authority
        </a>
        by Wonthaggi's own

         Damien O'Connor
        </a>
        . Damien was acknowledged recently with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours. For 33 years Damien has provided selfless service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        and to the communities of the Bass Coast, distinguishing himself as a committed leader. Damien goes out of his way to share his knowledge and skills in order to develop existing and future crew leaders and brigade officers. With a reputation for driving continuous improvement and positive change, Damien is tireless in his endeavours to improve the management of fires and incidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Damien has said that he doesn't remember a time when he wasn't up at the CFA shed on Sunday with his parents. His family have also long been members of the brigade, with his dad, Phil, a life member and former captain and his mum, Mary, the group communications officer for 20 years. Damien's parents are to be commended for encouraging his volunteerism and highlighting the importance of the CFA in our regional towns and communities. This medal awarded to Damien is the first of its kind for Wonthaggi, and the local community can be justly proud of him. Damien is to be admired for his prolonged and distinguished service to the CFA and his commitment to improving community safety. Again, I thank Damien for his service and for his great sense of humour.
