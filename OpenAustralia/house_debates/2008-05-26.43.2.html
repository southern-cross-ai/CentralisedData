        My question relates to the previous question time on Thursday, 15 May. I would like to ask how you were advised that the document which the Prime Minister was quoting from—which I had sought to be tabled—was confidential.

        <p>
         As I noted in my letter dated 22 May to the member for Boothby, I have been advised that the document was confidential. The member for Boothby raised—as he has the right to do under standing order 201—the matter of whether a document relating to public affairs was being quoted by the Prime Minister and whether that would be tabled. In a bout of confusion—which I acknowledge that I contributed to—that was not possible at the end of question time. I undertook to take steps to ascertain whether there was a document that needed to be tabled as is required by the standing order and
         <i>
          Practice
         </i>
         . In doing that, I had to ascertain whether (a) a document was being quoted from and (b) whether that document was confidential. I have ascertained that, and I wrote to the member for Boothby and, as far as I am concerned, that is the end of the matter.

            Practice
           </i>
           for me to do on behalf of the member for Boothby has been done. Of course, if that had been done in the chamber, it would have resolved this matter then and there. That was not the case and, as far as I am concerned, the matter is concluded.

            Mr Speaker, I have a further question to you. It goes to the heart of the parliament’s role in providing oversight of the government. All of us who were in here saw what happened. My question to you is: is it appropriate for any minister, and especially the Prime Minister, to scurry from the chamber when any member is asking for a document to be tabled?

              Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. As the member for Boothby knows, the circumstance is that he rose from his place, got the call, walked towards the dispatch box and, at an equally similar pace, the Prime Minister was walking away from the dispatch box. As I said on the day—when, quite rightly, two other members indicated with helpful advice other things that I could have done—I did not do that, and I undertook to ascertain information and advise the member for Boothby as soon as possible. That is what I have done on behalf of the House, and I am satisfied that the matter is concluded.
