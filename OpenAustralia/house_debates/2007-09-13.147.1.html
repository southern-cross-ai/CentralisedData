       <p>
        Unfortunately, I have to bring to the attention of this House a report on
        <i>
         The 7.30 Report
        </i>
        on 11 June this year which was basically bogus. It related to signatures from more than 200 people on a mine site at Newman in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        on a petition suggesting that they had been victimised because they had signed on to an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
         AWA
        </a>
        . After receiving information from a number of my constituents who are fly in, fly out workers and other people involved in this industry, I sought to have this record corrected. I wrote to Mr Mark Scott, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Managing Director
        </a>
        of the ABC, and asked that he investigate the fact that some of the 200 signatures on the petition complaining about an atmosphere of intimidation, victimisation, safety incidents et cetera due to AWAs were bogus. It was found that, of all the signatures on the petition, at least 80 were illegible, many were from people who were not even working at Mount Whaleback and some were names of people who did not even exist, so the credibility of these claims had to be tested.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wrote to Mr Mark Scott that I have over 29,000 workers—in other words, one in three people—on AWAs in my electorate, which is the second-highest figure in Australia, and that he might want to correct the record due to this bogus report. I wrote that the report was obviously generated by the union involved and the ABC had fallen into line to support it, so Mr O’Brien and Mr Peacock should address that inaccurate and unprofessional report. By the way, there are 14½ thousand registered AWAs in Swan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Scott wrote back to me a month later, on 2 August, saying that he had received my letter, that they had looked into this matter, that they had believed it was a relevant story at the time et cetera. I will table all this information because of the time constraints so that it can be looked at properly. He said that the office of workplace safety had gone to the mine site, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        , to see whether the mine site was operating unsafely and with a culture of fear and intimidation, and that was found to be incorrect. Mr Scott said to me that he would wait for the state government mine inspectors to do an inspection of this mine site to see if they agreed with the petitioners. I have not heard from Mr Scott since then. He says: ‘Thank you for your concerns.
        <i>
         The 7.30 Report
        </i>
        will wait for the final report of this investigation and will do a follow-up story depending on the report.’
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, Mr Scott, you are a bit slow, because I have the mine inspector’s report, by Peter Capon, the district inspector of mines. Mr Capon—without going through all of his report; and I will table this—said that largely the issues raised were not valid. There are at the margins some communication issues, but it says, for example:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCEP" rel="nofollow">
         DOCEP

        acknowledges the effort of the site management team and employees on the improvement in the record of safety performance at Mount Whaleback mine, which has earned the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        ’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTC" rel="nofollow">

        award from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP_Billiton" rel="nofollow">
         BHP Billiton
        </a>
        for being the most improved site. There is a higher standard of safety comparable with the higher standards found in other major companies in the region. Of the 43 employees contacted during the investigation, the overwhelming percentage of the employees interviewed stated that they were not afraid to raise safety issues via direct action et cetera. Allegations that employees were too afraid to raise safety issues were not supported by greater than 90 per cent of the people questioned.
       </p>
       <p>
        This whole report puts into place the fact that this matter was inspired by the unions and then peddled by the ABC—by one of their great friends in the ABC, Kerry O’Brien. We know he has returned to type. He was a former staffer for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        and we know that, as a former staffer for Gough Whitlam, he was a Labor Party employee. He sneeringly attacks members of the government when they go on his program and he gives an easy ride to the opposition. Mr O’Brien, if you really want to be a player in politics—and you live in Warringah—why don’t you do as other ABC operatives like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_McKew" rel="nofollow">

               Order! Before I listen to the point of order can I say that normally someone would suggest they have documents to table and state what is in those documents, and I think the member for Canning did so in his address. He foreshadowed that he wanted to table them. He has asked whether leave will be granted for those documents to be tabled.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
                Can I
               </a>
               suggest that, if people are concerned about their contents, they refuse leave and then it could be sought for the documents to be tabled elsewhere. But, at this stage, the member for Canning is asking leave for the documents to be tabled. Is leave granted?

                    I do not seek to frustrate the process but, in the past, when I have sought to table documents the courtesy was given to those opposite to have a look at them. We are not saying we do not want to give him leave. If we are given the courtesy of looking at them, we may grant leave. I personally will not grant leave unless I see a document.

                     Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My understanding is that if the person speaking describes what the documents are as part of his presentation then at the end of that he has the right to seek leave to have them tabled. I may be wrong, but we have the Second Deputy Speaker here in the chamber with us and I would invite him, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to give us some guidance on the matter.

                      On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker: through you to the member for Canning, both the member for Banks and I are trying not to deny leave. The principle usually is that it is best to show those documents to the person in charge of either the Main Committee or the chamber, and then everybody can be happy. We are in a position where, whilst you are doing your job, we are trying not to deny leave to the member for Canning before he has the opportunity to come around and pass them over to us, and then later on we might be able to give leave.
