       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that in the last month the government deposed the democratically elected Prime Minister for a new Prime Minister no-one voted for, Nationals MPs have been in open revolt against the Deputy Prime Minister because of his failure to deliver an agriculture visa, and women in the government are quitting in disgust or being forced out? Why should Australians pay the price for a government which the Prime Minister himself has described as the muppet show?

         I wonder if the member can explain why this week he hasn't asked me one question about the drought.

           <p>
            When Labor lie about things, we don't have to believe them and we don't have to accept those lies. The Australian people don't accept those lies. What we are doing when it comes to agriculture and the drought in particular is being 100 per cent focused on the needs of those families and towns. On 26 October there will be a summit on drought here in Canberra bringing together the states and territories and representatives from across the agricultural sector. Major General Stephen Day will be here reporting on the actions that are being taken in coordination with the government to ensure that we can deliver not just the relief and the recovery but the resilience that is needed into the decades to come.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just today, one of the actions that we took—and I want to particularly commend the member for Wright for his role as the assistant minister here—was to get rid of a regulation that was going to stop feed from getting to where the farmers need it. This was a very practical thing that we've done. This government is about doing practical things, such as supporting our strawberry farmers to ensure that, after the tampering that took place, we can get that industry and those farmers back on their feet and encourage Australians to get behind them. I appreciate the support of both sides and all parties in the House to ensure the smooth passage of that legislation. Our government is getting on with it. The opposition might not be able to move on and might be stuck in reverse, but we're in drive.
