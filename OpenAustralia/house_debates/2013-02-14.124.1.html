       <p>
        On 12 December last year it was my great pleasure to host the Deakin National Volunteer Awards 2012. This was a great opportunity to formally recognise the work of some of our community's greatest contributors across many different and varied community and volunteer services. There are so many people in our community who volunteer their time, energy and expertise to help others, and I am always amazed by the number of groups who provide these services. Volunteers operate in areas such as community welfare, sport, education, recreation, environment, emergency services and health; and, quite simply, without the services of volunteers our country would be a far harsher place for the people who live here.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deakin National Volunteer Awards are important because they give the community an opportunity to see what people doâ€”and that is a great thing. The Deakin National Volunteer Awards 2012 were presented to the following volunteers. Jeanette Giles received the MP's Volunteer of the Year award for her outstanding long term volunteering service of over 30 years. In that time, Jeanette has volunteered for Donwood Day Care Centre, the Cancer Council of Victoria, Sing Australia, Heathmont Ladies Probus Club, Ringwood Calligraphy and Heathmont Uniting Church Community Living Centre and has tutored English to migrants at

        The Young Volunteer award, for the 18 to 25 years category, was presented to Catherine Pelling for her voluntary work in addressing climate change, including her attendance at the
