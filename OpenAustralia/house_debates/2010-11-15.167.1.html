         Building the Education Revolution

        program, the government has invested $16.2 billion in schools right across Australia for minor infrastructure and refurbishment projects, major new infrastructure in primary schools, and new science and language centres in secondary schools. In the past weeks I have had the very great pleasure of experiencing firsthand the benefits these projects bring to schools and their local communities in my electorate of Bass. It has been my privilege to attend the opening of these facilities and to meet the students and community members who are benefiting from this fantastic program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The official openings of new multipurpose halls and classroom refurbishments at Ravenswood Heights Primary School and Ringarooma Primary School have been perfect examples of what Building the Education Revolution set out to achieve. These two projects employed 36 workers—the very essence of the economic stimulus plan—with funding of over $3 million producing first-class learning areas, administration and school amenities. It has been fantastic to see the principals, school staff, parents and tradespeople working together to deliver these important projects. I would like to recognise the hard work undertaken by the schools, the community and the Tasmanian Department of Education in delivering these important projects. Now that they are completed, teachers and students in these schools will be teaching and learning in the 21st century facilities that they so richly deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students used to walk through the doors at Ravenswood Heights Primary School that faced into a brick wall. They are now walking into an inviting space with light through to the other side of the building, and they have learning spaces that are bright and welcoming. At Ringarooma Primary School I was thrilled to see the transformation of an old building into a modern, multipurpose hall, and I watched the children in the new space enjoy a joyful musical performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was tremendous enjoyment to celebrate the opening of these facilities and to witness the enjoyment that staff, students and parents all gained from the completion of these projects. The new halls and classrooms represent a great relationship between the federal government and local communities; a relationship that I will be striving to continue in the electorate of Bass. I congratulate the school communities involved and wish the schools and students all the best as they use their new 21st century facilities.
