        Nothing unites or divides us more than—what's it called?—football. North-west football is fantastic.

        Saturday the Wynyard Cats conquered the Ulverstone Robins in the North West Football League grand final, making it back-to-back wins for the Cats for the fist time in their club history. Not all was lost for Ulverstone; they took out the reserve grand final and also the underage competition.

        were on track to win the game, but they just did not have what it took.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cats" rel="nofollow">

        were too strong in the end, coming back to win 138-76. All players should hold their heads high not only for leaving everything they had on the ground but for playing the game in the true spirit of the game.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make special mention of some of the Wynyard heroes. Zane Murphy won the Wilf Barker Medal for best on-ground. That award comes off the back of a stellar season for which he also won

        and Player of the Year. North West Football icon Errol Bourn deserves particular recognition as coach of the

        , leading them to consecutive premierships. I should not forget the efforts of the 37-year-old Greg Sharman, who this year became only the second player in the league's history to kick over 100 goals in consecutive premiership teams.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, congratulations to the La Trobe Football Club, who hosted the grand final and did—as they always do—a fantastic job as host. The oval was in top condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again I want to congratulate all players and coaching staff and particularly all volunteers. We love our football, and your contribution is important to the fabric of our community.
