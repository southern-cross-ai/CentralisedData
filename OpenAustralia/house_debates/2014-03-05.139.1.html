       <p>
        Today it gives me great pleasure to recognise the service of two esteemed gentleman: Superintendent Zenio (Ben) Feszczuk
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APM" rel="nofollow">
         APM
        </a>
        , Commander Penrith Local Area Command, and Superintendent Ray Filewood, Commander St Mary's Local Area Command. Ben and Ray marched off together at the 23 August 2013 attestation in Goulburn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ben began his career at Police Training Centre Redfern on 19 February 1968, with his first post being to the No. 18 Division in Parramatta to perform general and traffic duties. Ben's many years of service included postings to Warragamba station followed by a career in the criminal investigation unit, where he worked across the Blacktown, Penrith and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys
        </a>
        areas. In 1998 he was appointed the local area commander for Campbelltown and in 2002 he was appointed the local area commander for Penrith. As a commander he established long, professional and personal relationships right throughout the Penrith community. He has been awarded the national medal with a third clasp, the New South Wales Police Medal with a seventh clasp, and the National Police Service Medal. In 2004, in the

         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        for distinguished service. He has served our community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for 45Â½ years. I thank you, Ben, for your service, advice and friendship. Even though now retired, Ben remains of an active member of our local community, devoting much of his time to Rotary and other community services. His work during the

        bush fires was phenomenal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise also Superintendent Ray Filewood's remarkable service of 40 years in the New South Wales Police Service. Ray joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Police Force
        </a>
        on 21 May 1973. He was posted to No. 6 Division at

        and police headquarters, assisting the assistant commissioner. Ray was finally sent west to the Penrith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAC" rel="nofollow">
         LAC
        </a>
        in 1983, working right across our region in general duties, patrol, anti-theft, the tactical intelligence unit and the state intelligence group. He was promoted to commander in 1997. In 2003 he came back to our region to serve as the commander of the St Marys Local Area Command. I recognise his service and his awards. Ray has received the National Police Service Medal, the national medal with a second clasp and the New South Wales Police Medal with a fifth clasp. On behalf of the Lindsay community, which I represent, I thank both of these gentlemen for their wonderful service, the advice they have provided me and the gift that they have given my community well into the future. Thank you, both.
