       <p>
        I wish to do something we don't often do in this chamber—that is, to say a few words of thanks and express our gratitude to Australians who are often overlooked. The speed of things in this place, the serious issues we confront, they all do matter. It's right we focus on the big issues, the big numbers, the nightly news. They can consume so much of our focus but sometimes we need to take a moment to draw breath to remember the people who build this country, who do so much every day, almost always without acknowledgement, to remember the heart and soul of the country we all love, the community leaders and volunteers who give of themselves for no other reason than it is the right thing to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to remember and acknowledge the late Mrs Jan Brill. Jan served the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        for 60 years. That is longer than most in this chamber have been alive. Jan is being buried as we speak. She passed away last week. The service was held at St John's Anglican Church in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan would not have imagined the parliament pausing for her, but we should pause for everything she embodies and the thousands of other Jans around the country—not just the

        but chambers of commerce, sports clubs, Meals on Wheels, Legacy, Scouts and Guides, giving back to us, to society. Before there is even politics, there is citizenship, and good citizens are the glue that holds our town centres, our suburbs and our country together. 'I'm just an ordinary farmer's wife, but I've been lucky enough to belong to a wonderful organisation that has given me many wonderful opportunities.' So said Jan Brill in 2003, reflecting on then 42 years in the Country Women's Association, including the important position as national secretary from 1997 to 2000 as well as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        secretary and vice-president.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan, who passed away last Tuesday after a long life of serving others, very much understated her value to the community and, indeed, the fondness and wide respect people held for her. She was a do-er, a woman of action who got things done, a lady in every sense of the word who sought and achieved great things on the national stage—certainly for regional areas in general and rural women in particular. Meticulous, lovely and elegant, and gracious was the way current New South Wales CWA vice president Ann Adams remembered Jan. Eighteen years ago to the very week, Jan had been appointed a

         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . This honour was thoroughly deserved. She continued her involvement with the CWA until the day she died.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only partnership in her life which endured for longer was her nearly 65 years of marriage to Alan, and my deepest condolences go to him; their children, Susan, Karen and Gary; their respective spouses, Peter, Mark and Robyn; 10 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren. May she rest in peace. Farewell, Jan, and thank you.
       </p>

         I join with the

          Acting Prime Minister
         </a>
         in paying tribute to his friend and constituent Jan Brill AM. Through her words and, most importantly, her actions Jan Brill reminded us of the true meaning of the expression 'pillar of the community', and she did it through an organisation that has for so long helped so many in our communities: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
          Country Women's Association
         </a>
         . At a local level she was group president, group secretary and group publicity officer. At a state level she was a representative to the state executive, the secretary and the vice president. At a national level she was national secretary. She won deserved recognition for her work in 2003 with her appointment as a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Member of the Order of Australia
         </a>
         . In 2015 she was named Riverina group patron.
        </p>
        <p>
         Speaking with her local newspaper more recently, Jan talked of following in the footsteps of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
          CWA
         </a>
         's pioneering members and carrying on their vision of improving the conditions for country women and their families, especially in rural and remote Australia. This organisation has been around for a very long time. It's easy to take it for granted, but it is worth re-acquainting ourselves with what the CWA really means. In the words of writer
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Pickering" rel="nofollow">
          Karen Pickering
         </a>
         , the CWA is 'the beating heart of tiny towns'. It is an integral part of the fabric of country life and, crucially, it is women looking out for other women. It is an organisation governed by its rank-and-file membership and, when the going gets hard in rural communities, the CWA is always there. It played a crucial role, for example, in distributing drought assistance over recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jan Brill and the CWA were the right fit for each other. Jan knew that she could help to change the lives of her fellow Australians for the better, and she did just that. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I offer my condolences to her family and many friends. May she rest in peace.
