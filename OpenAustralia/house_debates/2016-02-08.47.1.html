        that day. It was a shocking, horrific day, when even this parliament was brought to its knees in grief. I stand today to speak of that grief, although the blood of the victims, the ash in the forests and the sweat of those facing the foe, when they were joined together, did bring forth new life.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there are those who still grieve on this day for the loved ones they lost, for the children they lost, but especially for the future that those children were never given by the devastation of that fire. It was a proud moment when this parliament stopped still in its desire to be identified with those who died and those who stood against the foe with such bravery.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are eternally indebted to you. and we remember your grief this day. We know there are mums today who are still grieving for their lost children.

         I would just like to associate everyone on this side of the parliament with the previous member's remarks. I know, Mr Speaker, that your electorate, like mine, was threatened on that day, and I could not agree more with the words of the member for
