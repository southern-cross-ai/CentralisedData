        My question is to the Prime Minister. Australia is facing one of the most significant shifts in our global and regional security environment since before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . Will the Prime Minister please inform the House how strong and principled beliefs and actions are necessary to keep Australians safe during these uncertain times?

         I thank the member for his question. He brings much experience to the management of these international issues, certainly in the coalition ranks, and I thank him for his service in the diplomatic corps.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is facing one of the most challenging international environments and regional environments we've seen since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . The response of our government has been very clear as to how we're going to address those challenges. The first of those responses is this government will always stand up for the values of Australia. We will always stand up against coercion—we will always call it out—we will always put our national interests first, and we will never, ever trade away our values and those of the Australian people. And we have been commended for that approach. Earlier today I was able, as was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to meet with the Lithuanian foreign minister. It's another country in Europe that understands what it's like to be coerced by those in our region—one in particular. We will continue to stand up for Australia's values in the face of threats and coercion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, the way you keep Australia's resilience strong is by keeping your economy strong, because if you don't have a strong economy then you cannot invest in the defence capabilities, intelligence capabilities, law enforcement capabilities that are necessary to keep Australian safe, whether it's protecting our borders or whether it's ensuring we're investing in the defence capabilities that are necessary. You've got to defend Australia and you've got to be prepared to defend Australia and commit to those assets, whether it is the once-in-a-generation opportunity we now have to build a nuclear submarine capability in this country, brought about by this government through the AUKUS arrangements we were able to put in place, or the many other defence acquisitions and developments we are engaged in at this very time.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it's also about defending Australia here within the country and ensuring that we're standing up when it comes to organised crime or counterterrorism threats or things of that nature. It's about building our alliances and partnerships, whether it's being the first country ever to have a comprehensive strategic partnership with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         nations or the reboot and revamp of the Quad, which is so important for regional security. We've had the securing of the AUKUS arrangement, the most significant development in our relations with United States and the United Kingdom—particularly with the United States—since
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         . That is enabling us to keep Australians safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         And it's about always standing up and championing a world order that favours freedom. That's what this government will always do and that's why Australians have always trusted the coalition parties when it comes to national security, where we'll never have an each-way bet.
