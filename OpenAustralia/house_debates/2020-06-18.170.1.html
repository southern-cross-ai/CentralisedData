       <p>
        I'm honoured today to speak about the six very special constituents in the electorate of Petrie who were honoured in the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        list. On 8 June, the Governor-General announced the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours list, recognising a total of 933 Australians, including with the Order of Australia. I stand today to acknowledge and recognise all the impressive and distinguished Australians, especially those in the Petrie electorate, who have been awarded with this honour this year. They include Mr Ricky Stephen AM, for his significant service to the tourism and hospitality sector, particularly as a chef; and Mr Simon Patmore
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , for service to snowboarding as a gold medallist at the 2018 Pyeongchang Paralympic Winter Games. Fun fact: Simon became the first Australian man to win a medal at both the summer and winter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Paralympic Games
        </a>
        . There's not much snow in Carseldine, where he lives, but we're all very impressed with Simon's skills on the board.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also honoured were Mr Robert Tait OAM, for service to aviation education; and Mr David Teufel OAM and Mrs Robyn Teufel OAM, for their service to local youngsters through Scouts. Finally, Corporal Vikrant Vijayrao Deokar received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Conspicuous Service Medal
        </a>
        for meritorious devotion to duty as an information system detachment commander within 511 Signal Troop, 1st Signal Regiment, during the period 2018 to 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        David and Robyn Teufel, both from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , have been recognised for their service to local youth through Scouts, as I mentioned. The pair have dedicated more than 50 years to Scouts and giving back to local children. They are now also involved in looking after scouting history at Sandgate Scouts. David and Robyn want to encourage more locals to join the Scouts, and they say the organisation's longevity is testament to its success. Established in 1908, Scouts proudly celebrated its centenary in 2008. David says he believes that scouting is as relevant today as it was back then and that Scouts play an important role in developing children's leadership skills and character.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take this opportunity to talk about Robert Tait of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         North Lakes
        </a>
        , recognised for his service to aviation education. Mr Tait is the owner of Bob Tait's Aviation Theory School, which has operated out of the Redcliffe Aerodrome since 1981, and he has been teaching as a flight instructor since 1970.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate all the people who have won these awards. If you know someone who deserves recognition, visit the Governor-General's website. Anyone can apply.
