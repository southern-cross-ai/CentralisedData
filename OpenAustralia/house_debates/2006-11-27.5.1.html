       <p>
        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Morocco and Algeria and to the 52nd Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Nigeria, from 27 August to 9 September 2006. As the leader of the delegation, I am pleased to present this report. The visit to Morocco was the second official visit by an Australian parliamentary delegation to that country, the first occurring in 1993. The visit to Algeria was the first official visit by an Australian parliamentary delegation. The visits followed visits last year by members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade as part of an inquiry into expanding Australia’s trade and investment relationships with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         North Africa
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In Morocco the delegation had a range of senior meetings in the capital Rabat and also in Casablanca and Tangiers. We had the opportunity to visit the major new Mediterranean deepwater port development at Oued R’mel, near the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar" rel="nofollow">
         Strait of Gibraltar
        </a>
        , and to visit a marina project development in Casablanca. We chose to travel by car from Casablanca to the port development in the north to see more of the country and, of course, its infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Algeria we had meetings in Algiers and also visited historical and cultural sites in the country. We were pleased to hear that the security situation in Algeria has improved. Throughout our visit it was evident to us that there is much goodwill towards Australia in both Morocco and Algeria. The visit provided a valuable opportunity to strengthen the relationship between our parliament and the parliaments of Morocco and Algeria. We were also able to gain a better understanding of the bilateral relationship with each of the countries and the issues important to those two countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        We consider that there are good prospects of enhanced trade and investment relations with the two countries, notwithstanding distance, language and other constraints. In addition to the traditional areas of agribusiness, which apply for both countries, Morocco’s growing tourism sector offers many opportunities. In Algeria there are prospects in the construction sector, from the government’s major public investment program, as well as opportunities for trade in services. Both countries are moderate Arab countries with an advantage of geostrategic location. It will be important for the Australian government, through the

        </a>
        and Austrade, to continue to provide leadership in facilitating access for Australian companies. The delegation thanks the Moroccan and Algerian parliaments for the warmth of their welcome and for the informative programs they developed for our visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The theme of the 52nd Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Nigeria was ‘Enhancing standards of democratic governance and public perceptions of Parliament in the Commonwealth’. The delegation was pleased to represent the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Parliamentary_Association" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPA" rel="nofollow">
         CPA
        </a>
        , at the conference, and participated actively in plenary and workshop session discussions. We congratulate the Nigerian parliament on hosting the conference and on its generous hospitality. In our report we note that the executive committee of the CPA is to consider conference funding issues and we suggest, in this era of global communication and with active CPA programs at regional levels, that the frequency and duration of conferences be considered.
       </p>

        I would like to thank my fellow delegation member and deputy leader of the delegation the Hon.

        , the member for Hotham, for his outstanding support and work on the delegation and Mr Alan Griffin, the member for Bruce, for his participation—and, I might add, for their great company during the visit. On behalf of the delegation, I would also like to thank all those who assisted with the visit, including officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office. Thank you in particular to Ms Tracey Haines and Mr Mark Unwin, who accompanied the delegation in Morocco and Algeria respectively, and to the Australian High Commissioner in Nigeria, His Excellency Mr Iain Dickie, and his staff. Finally, I thank the delegation secretary—and I see her in the chamber here—Ms Robyn McClelland, for her very helpful support.

         I join with the member for Leichhardt in his comments, particularly in relation to Robyn McClelland. I think she has done a mighty job in preparing this report, and we thank her for her cooperation. I also thank the other members of the delegation—the member for Leichhardt and the member for Bruce. It was not just a rewarding trip; it was good company as well. People outside this place often see us brawling, but we actually do a lot together when we are given the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was my first bilateral delegation visit in the almost 17 years that I have been in this parliament. Interestingly enough, it is also my first attendance at a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Parliamentary_Association" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
         </a>
         conference. I want to make a couple of broad observations. First, I believe it is important that we develop and foster parliament-to-parliament relationships. I have been involved in many government-to-government and opposition-to-government dialogues, but I think it is fundamental that we as a parliament engage other parliaments. The bedrock of any vibrant democracy is its ability to ensure that the parliamentary process provides for accountability, transparency and representation. I think we have to learn more effectively of the progress, and indeed the shortcomings, of various countries in how they are dealing with this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also think the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association must play a role in promoting better mechanisms for greater accountability, transparency and governance, particularly within developing nations. We hear much about the ‘aid or trade’ argument. I say it has to be about helping developing countries, but, if we do not tackle the corruption in those countries, whatever is done in aid and trade is dissipated. Strengthening parliamentary institutions is an important mechanism for tackling this corruption, and I hope that, in the review of the funding of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association—which the member for Leichhardt has referred to—more emphasis is given to the role of training and support for these institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the bilateral front, Morocco and Algeria provide important opportunities on the trade, regional security and antiterrorism fronts. Both countries are pluralist parliamentary democracies, but they are having to deal with militant Islamism. Morocco, for example, experienced terrorist bombings in Casablanca in May 2003, and there were Moroccan links to the Madrid train bombings. Algeria pointedly rejected the phrase ‘the war against terrorism’, noting they had fought against terrorism for decades. I think we have to be sensitive to language issues here as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both countries have made significant efforts with real progress—a point which was acknowledged by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
          BHP
         </a>
         Billiton in Algeria. Their efforts involve not only strong counterinsurgency and intelligence gathering but also significant social and economic reforms to alleviate poverty and the lack of education. I think that Australia, through a stronger political presence in the region, should not only encourage both countries to settle their differences but urge both of them to promote a strong regional response against terrorism—and, for that matter, illegal immigration, which is also a matter of concern to both of them.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the trade front: strategically, both countries need to be looked at from the perspective of trade potential, not just the levels of trade we are experiencing at the moment. Both of them have
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
          FTA
         </a>
         s with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         , and that can provide an important gateway for Australia, not just for bilateral trade but for trade with the rest of Africa and the rest of Europe. We as a delegation believe that serious consideration should be given to our organisation and representation in the area. It is important not only for trade but also for geopolitical issues and the significance of both these countries addressing those issues. I thank the parliament for the opportunity to have participated in this delegation.
