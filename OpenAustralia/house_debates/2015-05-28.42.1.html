       <p>
        I present a petition calling for category 410 retirement visa holders who have lived continuously in Australia for 10 or more years to be granted permanent residency and a pathway to Australian citizenship.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have previously advocated in this parliament on behalf of a group of individuals who are self-funded retirees, have private health insurance, have passed police clearances and have brought millions of dollars in capital and overseas-sourced pensions into Australia, and who make a valuable contribution to our community through volunteering.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a time when we call into question, due to treasonous conduct, the loyalty of certain individuals who have been recently granted Australian citizenship, on merit I believe that this group of individuals is worthy of favourable consideration for permanent residency and citizenship because they have demonstrated financial independence, the values of good citizenship and civic-mindedness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I inform the House of my intention to move a private member's motion in support of category 410 visa holders being granted a pathway to permanent residency and Australian citizenship. I am pleased to present this petition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The petition read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of 410 Visa holders residents in Australia draws to the attention of the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That 3000 self-funded individuals that call Australia home are currently prevented from becoming Australian citizens. A motion proposed by Senator Chris Ellison and agreed by the Senate on 28 June 2008 should be upheld by the government to 'enable temporary resident retirement 410 visa holders to apply for permanent residency'. Also in 2008 Senator Chris Evans then Minister for Immigration, declared that 'if people choose to make their lives in Australia they should have a pathway to citizenship open to them'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Surely 3000 retirement visa holders of whom we estimate no more than 2000 would take up Permanent Residence if offered deserve security in the knowledge that they have certainty, particularly all who:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Allow all holders of the Temporary Retirement Visa (sub-class 410) who have resided in Australia for a continuous period of 10 years or more the right to become Permanent Residents and Citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 4,522 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
