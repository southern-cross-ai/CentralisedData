        Today I would like to draw members' attention to the employment opportunities that are being delivered in my electorate of Cowper and along other parts of

         Department of Employment
        </a>
        released regional-employment projections for the five years to November 2019. By regional we mean both metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to advise the House that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        -Grafton area is forecast to experience one of the highest levels of employment growth in the country. In the five years to November 2019 the number of jobs is predicted to rise by 13.2 per cent, a very encouraging increase. Further south, on the mid-North Coast, the growth is less but still very robust, with jobs growth projected to be 8.8 per cent over the same five-year period. It is clear that one of the major contributors to this strong employment growth is the unprecedented investment in the construction of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        . As a result of the federal coalition and New South Wales government's coalition efforts, and investments of some $7 billion in the construction of the highway duplication to have that duplication completed by 2020, we have very significant employment growth being generated. We are creating opportunities for many local people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I had the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Senator Scullion, in the electorate and we met with five Indigenous trainees who had started work on the Kundabung to Kempsey highway upgrade.

        are the first of some 95 Indigenous trainees who will be signed up to work on key infrastructure projects in New South Wales. Most of these trainees will be placed on the Pacific Highway projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The five trainees will complete a Certificate III in Civil Construction through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Training Group, which will provide them with a potential career pathway in highway construction. Local tradesmen are also securing work on highway projects. I know in the Nambucca Valley the local council has been very proactive in linking small businesses with the main contractors on the

        project. Council's business development manager Wayne Lowe has been very focused on capitalising on this massive investment for local people. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley Council
        </a>
        is also working to ensure that local people benefit from the construction of the 155 km from Arrawarra to Ballina section which that is about to get underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pacific Highway is a massive project. It is delivering benefits to the people of the North Coast. It will result in faster and safer motoring, and more efficient use of freight. It is a great outcome in the employment space that we are seeing so many jobs created.
