        I would like to formally acknowledge and recognise in the parliament today a group of very special individuals. I place on the record my formal thanks for the service to our country of Mr Percival Hanlon, from Toowong; Mr Victor Hood, from the Gap; Mr Robert Mahoney, from Kenmore; Mr Kevin Prior, also from Toowong; Mr Arnold Russell, from Bellbowrie; Mr Mervyn Smolenski, from Kenmore; Mr Ross Thomson, from

        </a>
        ; and Mr Graham Tregenza, from Taringa. These very special constituents of mine were recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Medal
        </a>
        , which I had the great honour to present to them in a community ceremony in the Ryan electorate on 23 April. The Ryan electorate, which is based around the western suburbs of Brisbane, was very privileged to honour these men because, as we all know, those who wear the uniform of the Australian defence forces do so with great pride, with great courage and with great spirit. It is incumbent on all of us to honour their service.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Defence Medal was established in June 2004 under the Howard government. It is awarded to regular and reserve Defence Force members who have completed either their initial enlistment period or four years of service, whichever is the lesser, since the

        </a>
        . The Australian Defence Medal recognises the service of members, past and present, of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        who have made a remarkable commitment to our nation’s security, whether by serving our nation in actual operations or remaining in Australia in a supportive role.
       </p>
       <p>
        The eight individuals whom I have mentioned today were honoured at the ceremony that I conducted in April. I was pleased to be able to celebrate with them, their friends and their families. It was a moving ceremony held in the Mount Coot-tha botanical gardens in the Ryan electorate. There were a considerable number of guests. Friends of the recipients also travelled from interstate to be part of this special occasion and to witness them receiving this medal from me as a representative of the Australian parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a member of the parliament I want to also thank all those in the Ryan community who took part in the Anzac Day service. The community spirit is remarkable throughout Australia and it is especially so in the Ryan electorate. It is incumbent upon all of us to pay tribute to those who make a contribution to our country in a very unique way—one which all of us will not only honour but remember for a very long time to come.
