        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister outline to the House why the rule of law is vital in maintaining a stable flow of investment across Australia? Is the minister aware of any risks to this investment that would threaten the jobs of hardworking Australians?

         I thank the member for her question, because on this side of the House we are very aware of the importance of investment flowing into the Australian economy. We know the fundamental link between investment in the Australian economy and the ability to drive economic growth and to drive jobs. That is why, as the coalition, we are so committed to making sure that there can be confidence in the rule of law, in the Australian economy and in the Australian political system.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, in 2016 the report on the Index of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom" rel="nofollow">
          Economic Freedom
         </a>
         has Australia currently ranked fifth overall in world rankings and noted, 'Strong rule of law protects property rights and helps to minimise corruption.' Now, that would seem like a very worthwhile goal; that would seem like a goal fundamental to ensuring continued economic growth and fundamental to ensuring we have the opportunity for Australians to be able to secure employment. The problem is this—and it goes to the member's questions: there are threats to the rule of law in Australia. In fact, the threats to the rule of law in Australia come directly from the culture of those opposite. In particular, we see the greatest threat come from those involved in the militant

          <p>
           The problem is that we have seen a culture in the Australian union movement which was epitomised by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
            ACTU
           </a>
           Sally McManus when she said: 'I don't think there's a problem with breaking it in relation to Australian laws.' If that is the permeating culture in the Australian union movement, what chance do we have? But it is not just Sally McManus; it is more than that because it is more endemic. Just this week, we saw Australian Manufacturers Workers Union of New South Wales Secretary Tim Ayres say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Sally McManus was right, comrades—
          </p>
          <p>
           we are—
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           not going to be cowed into submission by … laws.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is another example of the culture in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           . The thing is, the Leader of the Opposition knows about this culture. When we talk about toxic donations, we are not talking about foreign entities that are making toxic donations; we are talking about the CFMEU. We are talking about the fact, for example, that they are taking money. The member for Griffith, the member for Werriwa, the member for Shortland and the member for Calwell—all of them—are affiliated with the CFMEU. All of them are prepared to turn a blind eye as the unions go about threatening children, as they go about threatening ordinary Australians and as they are prepared to trash the principle of rule of law. The

           </a>
           are suckling on the teats of the CFMEU and they will keep taking that cash and remain in silence until such time as we can put in place strong laws like the
