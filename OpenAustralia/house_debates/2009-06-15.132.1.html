        On Sunday I attended the Australian launch of the Flaming Evangelical Ministry. Flaming Evangelical Ministry is dedicated to the salvation of mankind and was founded in 1997 in Freetown in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone" rel="nofollow">
         Sierra Leone
        </a>
        by Bishop Frederick Abu Koroma. It is a strong church in that country. I met Bishop Koroma and while speaking at the church I expressed my view that he should be proud of what has been achieved by the leadership and members of the church, guided as they are by their faith. The ministry sees its mission as reaching beyond the church walls. In Sierra Leone, the Flaming Evangelical Ministry is involved in community development projects. Apart from education, it also helps the poor, disabled and needy.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia the ministryâ€™s objective is to advance the Christian faith and bring people to a wholesome relationship with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Their first church, established in the electorate of Cowan, was established to give hope to those who need it, specifically those of African origin. In Cowan, the church is led by Reverend Moses and his Assistant Pastor Sheriff. The church is assisted by the departmental team leaders, Amie Konneh, Princess Fahnbulleh, Paul Nawah and Beatrice Paye. The deacons are Thomas Gooding, Ares Ambarie, and Kelin Sesay. The elders are Catherine Rogers, Francess Kosseh and Jessie Kosseh. The church leaders were commissioned at the ceremony. There were more than 100 people present at the church. The people who have come from Africa have had difficult lives. Death and brutality is no stranger to many of them yet the members of the Flaming Evangelical church are strong of character and are further strengthened by their faith. They reach out to younger Africans.
