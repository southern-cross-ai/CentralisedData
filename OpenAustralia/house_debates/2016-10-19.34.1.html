       <p>
        Just like this government does not get workplace safety, just like this government does not get the importance of maintaining strong guns laws and just like this government does not get the importance of marriage equality, it is very clear that this government does not get the

         The Australian
        </i>
        today confirming the sackings of the NDIS board, including the father of the NDIS Bruce Bonyhady. What does that tell us? It tells us that this government, under the direction of the Minister for

        This minister has failed to adequately resource the NDIS. This minister has failed to deliver a meaningful or competent

        system in relation to the let downs of the myplace portal. This minister has failed the basics in meeting deadlines. Contrast that with the Labor Party. The Labor Party had the vision to articulate the need for the NDIS in the first place, as opposed to this mob opposite. It was Labor who was the architect and builder of Medicare. Labor was the architect and builder of superannuation. Labor is the architect and builder of the NDIS. Compare that to this government, who has simply let Australians down.
