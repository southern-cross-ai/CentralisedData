        Today I rise to pay tribute to the citizens of Calare whose contributions to community and country were recognised in the

        Kaye Chapman received an

        </a>
        for service to the community of Cowra. Kaye now lives in Orange and has a passion for supporting people through loss. Kaye founded the Cowra Community Chest in 2003, and through the community chest, she has helped raise over half a million dollars to help cover treatment and travel costs for locals who have fallen ill.

        Margaret Hargans was recognised for over five decades of service to the Bathurst community. The volunteer roles she has held over that time are too numerous to mention, but Margaret is perhaps best known for her love of radio, which led her to volunteer at Radio 2MCE Bathurst for the past 43 years.

        Susan Nicholls fell in love with Gulgong two decades ago and has never looked back. Susan is a history buff whose work with the local historical society has helped connect people from all over Australia with their past. She is also the President of the Gulgong Country Women's Association branch, where she is well loved and much respected. Her dedication to her town was recognised with an
