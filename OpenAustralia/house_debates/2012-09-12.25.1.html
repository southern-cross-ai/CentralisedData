       <p>
        I rise to congratulate Australia's Paralympians on their amazing celebration of sporting ability at the 14th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games" rel="nofollow">

        in London. A record 164 nations competed—including our 161 athletes—across 13 sports. In the final tally, Australia finished fifth, with 85 medals. This is a spectacular result, and our community is especially proud to have four champion Paralympians in our region.

        There is Joann Formosa from Broadford who, on her horse
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Worldwide, won gold in the grade 1B equestrian dressage competition. Joann is a member of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hidden Valley
        </a>
        riding club near my home town of Broadford and volunteers with Riding for the Disabled. It is a fantastic accomplishment for Joann to win the gold; her determination rewarded her with this gold medal.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Natalie Smith
        </a>
        , who won a bronze model in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SH" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        1 10-metre air rifle event. Nat has been competing for just two years and had already won a gold medal at the 2011
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPC" rel="nofollow">
         IPC
        </a>
        World Cup held in Sydney. Before Natalie went to London I presented her with an Australian flag, and she flew it proudly in the athletes village. Her story is an absolute inspiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is Jake Lappin from Kilmore, who turned 20 just yesterday and who competed in the 400-metre and 800-metre wheelchair-racing events with a strong performance. In the lead-up to the Olympics, Jake trained twice a day, six days a week, including with weights and professional training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there is Ahmed Kelly, who competed with great determination in the 50-metre breaststroke, just missing out on a bronze medal. He grew up on a farm near Kilmore with his adoptive mother,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
         Moira Kelly
        </a>
        , and siblings. Now that Ahmed has had a taste, I am sure that his determination will see him go even better in the next Paralympics.
