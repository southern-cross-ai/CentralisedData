        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the steps the government is taking to strengthen the integrity of Australian citizenship, and is he aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I thank all of my colleagues on this side of the House, who are absolutely determined to make sure that we get the settings right when it comes to Australian citizenship. Now more than ever we need to make sure that we are accepting the right people as Australian citizens. Since 1949, we have accepted five million people to become Australian citizens. They have done a great job in working hard, taking the opportunity afforded them, educating their children, amassing wealth and becoming a great part of the modern Australia. But we want to make sure that the small minority of people who do the wrong thing do not become Australian citizens, which is why it is odd to follow the Leader of the Opposition and those on his front bench and back bench and their contributions to this debate in opposing our changes to strengthen Australian citizenship. This is quite odd.

                As I said, it is not matter who you look at—the opposition frontbench or backbench—they are completely and utterly divided when it comes to what is a very important issue. You had one of the frontbenchers from the Labor Party out in the press today on this very issue. As it turns out, some of the measures that he was talking about have already been before this parliament, in 2014. He claimed that he had not had a briefing, or had no understanding or no comprehension of what was being put forward. But he had dealt with some of these matters only a couple of years ago. I say to members in this place: would you trust anything that comes from the member for Watson when it comes to national security issues? No. Do you know why? Because his actions speak louder than his words. There was a time when he was immigration minister. They were not glory days. They were not the best days of the Rudd-Gillard years. He was not the worst, to be fair; he was not the worst among them. We can go to others, including the member for McMahon. But we do know that on the member for Watson's watch there were 83 boat arrivals. He nods, approvingly, proud of the fact. Eighty-three is not bad, compared to double that number—in fact, 400 for the member for McMahon. The member for McMahon is very quiet in this debate. When you have a look, 6,600 people came during the member for Watson's watch, when he was immigration minister. If you do not mind, Mr Speaker, I will not be taking advice from him.
