        Well, the missing link has been found. You can stop looking. Not only has it been found; it's been delivered. The

        In particular, I want to mention
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Goodwin" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Goodwin
        </a>
        , the head of the local contractor SGQ Pty Ltd. Bob announced on the weekend, at the opening of the road, that this is his last project. He is absolutely renowned across the district for the wonderful projects that he and his now very large company deliver. In fact, in the 1980s Bob was with the then

        , a former councillor, and Denis Chapman, a current councillor, for their work on this.

        Those opposite spruik inclusion, but the inclusion doesn't include local members, because we were advised by the local council that the federal department had told them that I, as the federal member, couldn't be involved. Fortunately, the mayor saw sense and I got the opportunity to be included, not excluded, from the announcement.
