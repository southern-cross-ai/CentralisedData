       <p>
        Last October I met with one my constituents Chris Stoker. Chris is a lovely bloke who told me a horrible story about his time as a student at Brisbane Boys Grammar School during the tenure of school counsellor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Lynch" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Lynch
        </a>
        . Lynch left a trail of devastation at both Brisbane Boys Grammar and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's" rel="nofollow">
         St Paul's
        </a>
        . This monster sexually abused multiple students at both schools, one of those being Chris. Mr Lynch was later charged with nine offences but committed suicide the next day. At the time of Mr Lynch's employment, then principal Dr Maxwell Howell knowingly allowed modifications to the school counsellor's office to include blacked-out windows, deadlocked entry and exit doors, and a traffic light and intercom system to control entry to the office.

        told Dr Howell that Mr Lynch had sexually abused his son BQJ. Dr Howell did not investigate the allegations and did not report the matter to the police or the board of trustees. In not doing so, he failed in his obligations to protect the safety and wellbeing of the students.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make matters worse, Dr Howell also provided a glowing reference for Kevin Lynch despite being well aware of numerous allegations against him. Consequently, this monster then moved his abuse onto new students at St Paul's. My constituent Chris Stoker knows that he will never see justice because Mr Lynch and Dr Howell are both dead. However, what Chris wants is for Mr Howell to be removed from the records as a past
