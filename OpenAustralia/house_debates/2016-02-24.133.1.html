        I rise to speak today about the Ku-ring-gai Art Society and, in particular, its retiring president, Mr Malcolm Carver. The Ku-ring-gai Art Society was founded in 1965 and I was delighted to attend its 50th anniversary event last year. The society meets regularly and often has notable guests giving instruction. It holds regular exhibitions, workshops and demonstrations. Notably, each year the Ku-ring-gai Art Society holds its annual awards exhibition. For the past several years, I have been pleased to award the Member for Bradfield's Prize to a painting which best exemplifies, in my view, our area of Ku-ring-gai and of Bradfieldâ€”a painting which showcases the magnificent natural features and the built environment of the wonderful area in which we live. The winner is featured on my Christmas card for the year, and it is always well received. In Christmas 2015, my Christmas card featured a work by David Hammersley depicting Bobbin Head Road in Turramurra. The feedback on Mr Hammersley's work was extremely positive. I look forward to once again awarding the Member for Bradfield's Prize this year, and anybody here who is on my Christmas card list will see the outcome of that important work.

        I also want to pay tribute to Mr Malcolm Carver, a local architect who formerly ran his own architectural firm and who, for the past seven years, has also been President of the Ku-ring-gai Art Society. Malcolm is himself an accomplished artist with a focus on watercolour works. His works have been exhibited in solo exhibitions in Sydney, in Italy, in China and in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , as well as in many group exhibitions. He became a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Watercolour_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Watercolour Institute
        </a>
        in 2007 and has exhibited with that organisation in many group exhibitions. As president, Malcolm has shouldered substantial administrative burdens and has led the Ku-ring-gai Art Society to success after success. As a guest at a number of Ku-ring-gai Art Society events over the years, I have personally witnessed the passion and enthusiasm of the large membership of the society, as evidenced most powerfully by the substantial volume and quality of the works produced by its members. Every year, when I go to the exhibition I am struck by the quality and diversity of the work on display, and I want to pay tribute first of all to Malcolm Carver for his work in leading the society over the last seven years. I congratulate the newly elected president, Charmaine Phillips, and I congratulate all members of the Ku-ring-gai Art Society on the wonderful contribution they make to our local community.
