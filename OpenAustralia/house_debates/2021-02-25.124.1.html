        Each year, I rise in this parliament to honour the lives of women who have died in the past year through acts of violence, often by someone known to them. Tonight, I stand to honour and pay my respects to the 55 women who died last year. This equates to more than one violent death every week in 2020. Regrettably, the actual number is likely to be much higher, as the list is limited to deaths that have been publicly reported.

        The confronting reality for so many women during the coronavirus pandemic is that they were trapped in their homes with their abusers. In July, a survey by the

        revealed that almost 10 per cent of Australian women in a relationship had experienced domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis. Two-thirds of those women said that the attacks started or became worse during the pandemic. For women with previous experience of physical or sexual violence, 50 per cent said the abuse had become more frequent or more severe since the start of the pandemic.

        Before I acknowledge each woman who is no longer with us, I want to acknowledge the researchers from Destroy the Joint, who do the heartbreaking and difficult work of maintaining the Counting Dead Women register, where this information is recorded.

        Each of these shocking and painful deaths is a tragedy, and each death should further galvanise us, as political leaders, to do absolutely everything we can to end this scourge in our nation. In the year 2021, we have already seen five women lose their lives as a result of violence. I don't want to stand here every year reciting the names of women who have been violently murdered, but I will because each and every one of them must be remembered. Their deaths cannot be in vain. We have to stop violence against women and children, and we need to do it urgently.
