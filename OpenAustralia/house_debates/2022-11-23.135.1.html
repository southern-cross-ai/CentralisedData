        This fortnight, this parliament has a critical opportunity to take decisive action for workers across our nation by passing our Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022â€”action that must be taken. We can also take action on behalf of lower-paid workers being exploited by multinational companies like Amazon around the globe.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Black Friday sales begin, not just in America but also here in Australia and many other countries, Amazon workers will face undeniable pressure and stress to fulfil orders around the globe. The race to the bottom on wages and secure jobs is a global problem, and Amazon is a prime example. This week the

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">
         TWU
        </a>
        and unions across the world are calling for an end to poor working conditions and low wages for Amazon workers. Amazon Flex drivers aren't even getting the minimum wage. They have no rights and they are pressured to drive dangerously overloaded cars to avoid being sacked on a whim. While profits soar, they're seeing no pay rises for working unimaginable hours without breaks. We're seeing discrimination against pregnant workers. In too many of their sites across the globe, Amazon workers are forced to work in unsafe environments, often too afraid to speak out or to join the union for fear of retaliation. As the union for Amazon online retail workers, the SDA has worked tirelessly to stop the Americanisation of wages and working conditions in Australia. The TWU is also working hard to prove provide safe standards for transport workers who deliver Amazon's goods to consumers. It's time to make Amazon pay.

        In a sign of things returning to some normality, it has been great to get back out and start attending a range of school fetes and activities around my electorate of Bean. On Saturday 12 November, I attended the fete at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas" rel="nofollow">
         St Thomas
        </a>
        the Apostle Catholic Primary School in Kambah. It was a very well-organised and well-attended event and it was good to see the entire school community come together to showcase the school and all it has to offer. Congratulations to all the students and staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm looking forward to attending the

        </a>
        celebration this Friday, which will mark the 30th anniversary of the opening of the school by Queen Elizabeth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It's shaping up to be a fantastic, if somewhat poignant, event. The Bonython Primary School community have done a great job of putting it all together, and I am proud to be able to support the event. Hardworking school communities are the foundations of every great school and every great community. This is something everyone here knows. I look forward to the Bonython Primary event this Friday, as well as all the other fetes that come across this summer.
