       <p>
        I present the report from the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests concerning an application from Mr Marcus Lee for publication of response to a reference made in the House of Representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Marcus Lee has made an application under procedure adopted by the House on 27 August 1997 for publication of response to references made about him by the Honourable Stuart Robert MP on 11 October 2012 in the Federation Chamber and on 26 November 2012 in the House. The committee considers Mr Lee should be given a response and the terms of response have been agreed to by him and by the committee. A copy of the response is on appendix 1.
       </p>
       <p>
        In agreeing to a response, the committee notes as required by the resolution of the House of rights of reply that it has not considered or judged the truth of many statements made by members in the House of a person seeking a response. The committee recommends the response by Mr Lee at appendix 1 to references made about him on 11 October 2012 in the Federation Chamber and on 26 November 2012 in the House being incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , signed by myself.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to make a short statement on the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report I have presented concerns an application from one person for the publication of a response to references made about him in the House. The committee has recommended to the House that a response in the terms included in the report be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In recommending that the response be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , the committee emphasises that, as required by the right of reply resolution, it has not considered or judged the truth of any statements made by the member in the House or by the person seeking a response.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report—by leave—agreed to.
