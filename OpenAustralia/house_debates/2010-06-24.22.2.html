       </p>
       <p>
        On 18 April 2010 the government announced that a significant number of irregular maritime arrivals would be transferred from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        detention centre to the Australian mainland. As a result of this announcement, the

         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        has identified that various infrastructure and upgrade works are required in order for the facilities to meet detention standards. These sites include

        , which will accommodate single males, Northern Immigration Detention Centre Darwin, which requires upgrade and expansion works to increase the current amenities available to clients accommodated within the centre, and Christmas Island, which will undergo further works, including a security system upgrade, client amenity upgrades and additional staff accommodation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $190.29 million plus

        and is inclusive of capital and operational expenditure. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence immediately and be completed by May 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that a proposal to proceed with a construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common. The government very much supports the work of the Public Works Committee and has not taken this decision lightly. I commend the motion to the House.

        </p>
        <p>
         Stage 1 will develop 166 residential lots to deliver up to an expected 178 dwellings with DHA constructing 50 houses to accommodate defence families in Darwin. Under a memorandum of understanding between DHA and the Northern Territory government, 25 lots will be offered to the Northern Territory government to support its affordable and community housing initiatives. The remaining lots will be sold to the public. The proposed development is part of ongoing activity to replace houses that do not satisfy the current standards of defence housing. Community standard defence housing is vital to Defence attracting and retaining skilled personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
         DHA will develop the site as an economically viable, sustainable and affordable master-planned community. The lot layout and house design will recognise Darwin’s climate and unique lifestyle, paying particular attention to minimising energy consumption. Site development and housing construction will be governed by DHA through its contractors and in accordance with DHA’s national specification covering housing performance and design. The gross outlay for stage 1 is estimated at $41.4 million inclusive of

        </p>
        <p>
         Defence Housing Australia proposes to develop a 15.74 hectare site at Voyager Point, New South Wales. The site was formerly the Department of Defence’s East Hills Barracks. The proposal will provide an additional 59 homes for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel and their families, particularly for those members serving at the Holsworthy Army base. The site will be divided into lots capable of accommodating a total of 137 homes. The lots that are not required by Defence will be sold to the general public, creating a mixed civilian and defence community and reducing DHA’s net outlay.
        </p>
        <p>
         The proposal is part of ongoing activity to replace houses that do not satisfy the current standards for ADF housing that were introduced in 2007. Community standard housing for families is vital to the ADF in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, and the site is conveniently located three kilometres from the Holsworthy Army base and six kilometres from the Liverpool city centre. The homes constructed will deliver an excellent lifestyle opportunity for Defence families.
        </p>
        <p>
         The development of the site and the construction of houses will be governed by DHA through a number of contractors in accordance with DHA’s national specifications covering performance and design requirements for DHA housing. The total out-turn cost of the proposal is estimated at $45.1 million inclusive of GST and land acquisition, with the net cost reduced through the sales of surplus lots. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in March 2011 and be completed by December 2013. On behalf of the government I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

Funded by the government’s Super Science Initiative, the Pawsey centre will provide a high-performance computing facility that supports a diverse range of high-end research, including radio astronomy, nanotechnology, biotechnology, geoinformatics, engineering, atomic physics and chemistry.

         reactor building. The proposed Centre for Accelerator Science will enhance Australia’s capability for the vital studies of climate and environmental science, nuclear safeguards and forensics, materials science, human history, medical physics and radiation physics.
        </p>

         In the 2009-10 budget the government allocated $20 million under the Education Investment Fund to establish the new Centre for Accelerator Science.

         ’s OPAL reactor’s neutron beam instruments are used by Australian and international researchers and industry in an extremely wide range of science. Those instruments are operated by ANSTO’s Bragg Institute. Given the increasing demand for the operational instruments and the impending addition of new instruments together with increasing demand for the other services provided by the OPAL reactor, the Bragg Institute and the OPAL reactor building have reached capacity and require extensions. ANSTO therefore proposes to construct and fit out additional offices and laboratories at the Bragg Institute to accommodate approximately 150 staff, students and visiting researchers.
        </p>
        <p>
         ANSTO further proposes to construct and fit out additional offices, workshops and laboratories at the OPAL reactor building to support reactor operations. This project will also provide additional facilities and accommodation to optimise ANSTO’s ability to produce radioisotopes and irradiate silicon. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $62.5 million including GST. In its report, the parliamentary Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in November 2010 and be completed by September 2012.

The existing fit-outs at these locations are in poor condition—in most cases more than 20 years old—are not related to the DCCEE’s organisational and operational needs and are not capable of economical refurbishment to modern standards. As a result of the machinery-of-government changes announced on 26 February 2010, the DCCEE also has staff currently accommodated in the

In its report the parliamentary Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction of the fit-out is expected to commence in September 2011, with completion scheduled for August 2012. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.
