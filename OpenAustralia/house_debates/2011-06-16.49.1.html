       <p>
        I take this opportunity to congratulate a local band, Penny and the Mystics, who are based in the Illawarra. Penny and the Mystics recently received a grant of $15,000 under the federal government's latest round of Contemporary Music Touring Program funding. Funding under this program ensures that regional Australia gets the chance to see live performances from some of our up and coming musicians. It is therefore great news that the talents of Penny and the Mystics will be able to use this grant to greatly expand their touring opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This band already tours extensively on the New South Wales South Coast and will now be able to take their music to new parts of regional Australia, including interstate to destinations like

         Hervey Bay
        </a>
        in Queensland. Penny and the Mystics have had a great career to date, as well as well deserved acclaim from many music critics and they have a following of many dedicated fans in the Illawarra and beyond. I believe that it is important to foster the creative energies of our young folk and bring youth culture to regions that otherwise miss out. As somebody who enjoyed my fair share of live music in my youth, I am pleased to congratulate Penny and the Mystics on winning this grant and wish them well for their coming tour, and I encourage all members of this place to rush out and buy one of their CDs.
