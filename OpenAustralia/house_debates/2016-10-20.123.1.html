        I rise to bring up the issue of an educational program called Building Respectful Relationships, which is currently being taught in Victorian schools with plans for it to come to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . One of the segments that I have great concerns about is a role-playing game where year 9 girls get to play characters. One of those characters is Megan, and these are the words on the character card from the curriculum:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Megan is 17, lives in the city and works in a local cafe. She has had 15 sexual partners and describes herself as bisexual.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She rarely practises safe sex … because she is often drunk when she has sex.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is someone that your daughter could be playing in school today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another character they may be asked to play is Grace.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Grace is 16 and … has had four boyfriends and has been sexually active since she was 13.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another character they may be asked to play—these are year 9 girls—is that of Kelly. The character card for Kelly says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Kelly is 14, in Year 9 and is very interested in girls. She is not sure but thinks she might be a lesbian.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Kelly says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘I think I’m a lesbian but I’m not sure because I have also been attracted to a boy. I guess this gives me more options …'
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not believe that such sexualised role-playing has a part in our schools, and I cannot believe that any parent or grandparent of a year 9 girl would consent to their daughter being asked to play Kelly, Grace or Megan. Why is this being done? We know, from psychological studies, that, when there is role-playing, some of the character can bleed into the role-playing participant. I put it that it is completely against the best interests of our society to have young girls in year 9 being given these role-playing cards. The instructions given to teachers say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        * Give each of the students a "character card" … a name tag and hat with their character name on it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        * Explain that they will be acting as a group of young people who have come together …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        * Give them time to read their character description and think about their role—
       </p>
       <p>
        Think about playing those highly sexualised roles—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        * Give them a few minutes to get into their character.
       </p>
       <p>
        What does a year 9 girl do to get into a role where she is 17 and lives in the city and has 15 sexual partners and describes herself as bisexual? I do not believe this has any place in our education system, and I hope that members of the opposition agree with me.
