       <p>
        I'm very pleased to speak in continuation. Having heard some terrific stories about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Crean
        </a>
        and his relationships with people on both sides of this parliament through his many years as a minister, I want to focus on the role that Simon Crean had in the arts. He really helped redefine how we talk about the arts and how we value creativity. He believed in the value of art for art's sake, but he also understood the need to recognise the contribution that the arts can make to other areas of public policy, like education, health, innovation and employment. He made that argument with eloquence, rigor and passion. He spoke persuasively of the social and economic dividends that creativity pays to us, arguing that investing in the arts helped cement 'the values of inclusion and the values of respect' that are so essential to social harmony. He said that a creative nation is a productive nation, recognising that support for creative endeavour is an investment in our economic development and our capacity for innovation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Minister for the Arts, Simon brought not only thoughtful leadership but substantial new investment to the arts. His policy introduced new support for digital gaming and live music. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Council
        </a>
        for the Arts was modernised and given expanded responsibilities—and you can see there the things that we have built on in our own cultural policy, Revive. We've taken the base that he set and we've progressed it further, given the passage of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Simon Crean's tireless advocacy earned him the deep respect of the arts community.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
          Simon Crean
         </a>
         was a great warrior of the labour movement. He was also a titan of Australian business and the union movement itself. He was excellent company and he was a lot of fun. One of the first generation of parliamentarians to inhabit this building from 1990, Simon's impact lives long and is fondly remembered along its corridors and on all sides of the aisles. When he left it 23 years later, he left both this parliament and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         , which he led from 2001 to 2003, in a manifestly better place. I observed Simon's leadership through my friendship with many of those who served him: Simon, Sam and Hernan. There is nothing harder than changing your own party's power-sharing matrix, and in this Simon was somewhere between crazy-brave and utterly fearless.
        </p>
        <p>
         Simon took his relish for progress and progressivism into life after politics. A polymath in public policy, Simon remained active in education, trade, arts and culture, meat and livestock, regional development and, indeed, national disaster recovery. This is where I got to know Simon—through our mutual involvement in Australian trade, export and trade agreements, and in our shared love of Australian arts and culture. Of course, Simon and I usually disagreed on how to get to where we both believed Australia could go—Simon always more multicultural, me more bilateral or regional; Simon more about national arts policy, me more focused on the invitation to all Australians so that they knew they were welcome and wanted in the world of both elite and local arts and culture. But the banter, the disagreement, the challenge: that was half the fun. And, as I said to Carole Crean on Monday, Simon was always so much fun.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the condolence speeches in the main chamber on Monday, the member for Hotham referred to Simon's industrious support of women in the Labor Party. Perhaps less well known is his support and encouragement of women in the other side too.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before the 2019 election I put my hand up and failed, as so many I look up to in this building did before me. I picked myself up, put on my boots and got back on the horse. It was a few days after that defeat that I saw Simon. In Melbourne circles you always saw Simon somewhere. I was brave-faced at the time but as flat as a tack. Simon was the first to put the wind back in my sails—'You're a great Liberal warrior, Zoe. You'll be back.' I didn't believe him at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         My main interaction with Simon over the last decade was through the amazing family of business leaders who gather around the table of the European Australian Business Council, where he served as chair, following in the shoes of another great Australian politician
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Greiner" rel="nofollow">
          Nick Greiner
         </a>
         . Simon became Chair of the European Australian Business Council, or EABC, in 2019. It was a role he seemed to relish, driving greater trade and investment, sharing of know-how and research, as well as cultural collaboration. Indeed, this was a role that gave free reign to all of Simon's passions, and he executed it spectacularly well.
        </p>
        <p>
         I attended some of the EABC missions with Simon and many of their local discussions on our European business, investment, trade and cultural links as a member of the EABC's Corporate Council before I came to this place. It was on the eve of the 2023 mission that Simon was lost to us. After years of frustrating disruption through COVID and on the precipice of signing a trade deal with the European Union, I can imagine Simon in his usual let-me-at-them, bounding-enthusiasm disposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         His loss quite simply devastated his European business family. I'm grateful to

         of the EABC, for allowing me to add some of their words into this condolence motion today. They said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The EABC is devastated by the loss of our Chair Simon Crean who tragically passed on the eve of leading our Business Mission to Europe.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australian business and industry leaders with us here in Berlin, and our wider community at home, shocked by the sudden loss of a great Australian who has always led with conviction, wisdom and warmth.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our deepest condolences to Carole and the Crean family, and to the so many close friends and family who are profoundly saddened by Simon's passing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sense of family around the EABC should not be underestimated. Indeed, some of them were here in the parliament on Monday for the remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and many attended the state funeral for Simon last week in Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the evening of 25 June the EABC team, led by Jason Collins and Jo Johns, wrote to its broader business community:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A brutal day is drawing to a close here in Berlin where it was with profound sadness that our Chair, Simon Crean, passed away during his morning walk, just an hour or so before we were to commence our 2023 EABC Business Mission to Europe.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For those of us already in Berlin we had a lovely evening last night with Simon and Carole, where with high spirits and sense of purpose we discussed all the meetings to come in Berlin, Brussels, Stockholm, Paris and London.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It's still a shock, but today our focus has been to provide all the support we possibly can to Carole, whilst at the same time she has urged us to 'get on with the job' as Simon would have expected us to do by continuing with the mission at this critical time in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         -Australia relations. We'll do so with a heavy heart, and with great sensitivity and remembrance of the enormous contribution Simon made as our Chair, as part of an extraordinary lifelong record of public service.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In every endeavour, Simon led with conviction, wisdom and warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
         It fell to the EABC's deputy chairs Vicki Thomson, who leads the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight" rel="nofollow">
          Group of Eight
         </a>
         , and Jeff Connolly, who leads
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Thales Australia
         </a>
         , to put on the boots and make a brave face. Vicki said about Simon:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Simon Crean was a remarkable Australian, respected and admired by all who knew him. His passing is absolutely devastating and will be felt deeply by people at home and around the world. He was a great leader in politics, business and in life, dedicated to making peoples' lives better, whether it be through the trade union movement, as a political leader serving in the Cabinets of four Labor Prime Ministers, as Chair of the EABC or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Chancellor" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
          Monash University
         </a>
         . As EABC Chair, Simon has made an invaluable contribution to deepening and modernising ties between Europe and Australia to build a more sustainable and prosperous future for both regions. He had a deep and lasting commitment to community and the greater good. This is an extremely sad day for Australia. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Connolly added:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The European Australian Business Council has had the honour of experiencing Simon Crean's remarkable leadership in pursuit of closer ties with the European Union and its
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_States" rel="nofollow">
          Member States
         </a>
         . Simon was a unique Australian whose deep understanding of international trade and intercultural sensitivities enabled him to bring differences of opinion to respectful and meaningful compromise. We mourn his loss but add our voice of gratitude for his profound contribution to a better Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mission and its delegates, as well as the Crean family, were helped by the extraordinary ambassador,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Green" rel="nofollow">
          Philip Green
         </a>
         , and the embassy team in Berlin. We are so lucky to be served by such extraordinary teams in our missions overseas, especially in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are times when this building stops. It stops to recognise and celebrate its great men and, let's hope, increasingly in the future its great women—men whose grace, good humour, determination and courage have made parliamentary service honourable, worthy and admired. Simon was one of those men, and moments like this reflection are precious. I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute to it.

         <p>
          I acknowledge the very nice words of the member for Flinders. About six months after the last election, I was on my way to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Albert Park
          </a>
          branch of the Labor Party to give a report of what the new Albanese Labor government was up to and to have a discussion about the upcoming Victorian state election. It was an ordinary branch meeting, of course. No branch meeting in Macnamara is ordinary, but the Albert Park branch is a great branch in Macnamara. Attending just like any other branch member was the former leader of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Labor Party
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
           Simon Crean
          </a>
          . That was Simon. He loved the Labor Party. Every Labor member mattered to him, and he felt that, in and of itself, being a part of the Labor Party and doing his duty as an ordinary Labor member was something that he held very dear to himself. We were very lucky in Macnamara to have Simon Crean there with us in our local campaigns. I'm grateful for this opportunity to speak on the motion on the passing of the Hon. Simon Crean, Labor member for Hotham for 23 years, cabinet minister under four Labor prime ministers and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003.
         </p>
         <p>
          Simon's unexpected death in Berlin was devastating not only to his family but to the whole Labor family. Simon devoted his whole life and his enormous talents and enthusiasm to the great Labor cause. He was born into a Labor family and campaigned for Labor from boyhood, and he was still campaigning for Labor at the last election. I know this because Simon was campaigning for me. He stood on a booth for about six hours and handed out cards on election day, and then, in those 10 days where Macnamara was still not called, Simon Crean scrutineered for me day in and day out in a cold
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
           Port Melbourne
          </a>
          hall.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was a massive, cold hall in the middle of May, and I remember there was some Greens scrutineer who was there. It was one of their first times scrutineering, and they had to come up against the might and the experience of the former leader of the Labor Party. But that was Simon. He just was happy to be part of the team and happy to do his bit.
         </p>
         <p>
          Simon was a constituent, and on one day in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Middle Park
          </a>
          I was on a bit of a roll door-knocking and I door-knocked a home. Carole Crean answered the door. I hadn't met Carole before. She said: 'Josh, we're fine. This is the home of Simon Crean, but, if you'd like to stay for a few minutes, Simon will be home any minute.' I stayed, and Carole gave me a bit of food and some drinks, and then Simon and I kicked off our friendship that day. He was always interested in our campaign. He was always interested in what was going on. From the moment I became the candidate, he often had one or two asks as well: things and causes that were important to him—never things that had any benefit to him at all, only things that mattered to our local community.
         </p>
         <p>
          Simon was born into Labor royalty, and that Labor royalty was central to my local electorate and my community. The Crean family has been central to our Labor history in Macnamara ever since

I am proud to be one of the six members for Melbourne Ports or Macnamara, and Frank was one of the others. Simon's brother David was the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          Simon served as the national secretary of the storemen and packers union before becoming the

         <p>
          As I said before, Simon loved our local community and he loved the organisations within it. One of the first calls I got from Simon when I became the candidate for Macnamara was advocating on behalf of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Academy_of_Music" rel="nofollow">
           Australian National Academy of Music
          </a>
          . It's a great organisation that not only builds some of the best musicians in Australia but creates some of the best musicians in the world. Many graduates of ANAM go on to play for orchestras such as the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra" rel="nofollow">
           London Philharmonic Orchestra
          </a>
          , the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra" rel="nofollow">
           London Symphony Orchestra
          </a>
          , the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Philharmonic" rel="nofollow">
           Berlin Philharmonic
          </a>
          and, of course, our great orchestras here in Australia. They are extraordinary musicians. They require extreme discipline. Simon understood this in his work as minister for the arts and, I think, as someone who just appreciated the importance of harbouring Australian talent.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a big project going on with ANAM at the moment about how they set themselves up for the next 30 years, and Simon was integral in all of that. Upon hearing the news of Simon's passing, I got a call from the Australian National Academy of Music saying they would be honoured, if the family was open to it, to play at Simon's funeral. There were two performances by musicians from the Australian National Academy of Music at the extraordinary sendoff for Simon. I thank the Crean family and those musicians who paid tribute to Simon. Simon would have absolutely loved it. He would have been extremely chuffed that they did that. There was no bigger fan of the Australian National Academy of Music than Simon, and I thank the ANAM for that kind sendoff.
         </p>
         <p>
          Simon was the minister for primary industry, energy, trade, science, education, industrial relations and the arts. He was a versatile and hardworking minister, the kind a long-serving Labor government needs. But he had no luck as Labor leader, coming to the position at a very difficult time for our party. He made brave decisions, such as one we've all talked about: opposing the war in Iraq. But in 2003 he willingly stepped aside. Not everyone in politics gets the rewards their talents merit.
         </p>
         <p>
          Simon Crean was not just a Labor warrior, although he certainly was that. To me, above all, he was a friend. He was one of my favourite constituents. He was a giant of the Labor movement. My last memory of him will be of a chilly election day in 2022, seeing a former Labor leader in a red T-shirt cheerfully working as a booth captain for our local campaign.
         </p>
         <p>
          I send my deepest condolences to Carole and the whole Crean family. I thank them for lending Simon to public life. They can be proud that he made enormous contribution not only to our party but to our nation, and we miss him dearly.

           It is with great sadness that I deliver this condolence speech for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
            Simon Crean
           </a>
           , who was the first person I voted for in any election and my first boss in politics. I'm thinking of his wife, Carole, his daughters, Emma and Sarah, his brother, David, the extended Crean family, and all who knew and loved Simon, at this time. He will be terribly missed, as both a giant of the Labor movement and as a good man—a decent human being who has left an incredible legacy for this nation, a country he loved dearly. He will be deeply mourned but always remembered for the positive change he made to Australia and the lives transformed for the better during his life of service.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Simon entered the parliament in 1990, he was already an incredibly important national figure through his work in the Labor movement and his role in significant industrial relations reforms. Simon entered the ministry immediately. That was unusual indeed, but it was fitting that someone of his proven talents was able to serve the Labor government as a minister so early in his parliamentary career. In many ways, Simon's parliamentary career was not typical.
          </p>
          <p>
           Simon gave many speeches to parliament before he issued his address-in-reply speech, finding himself:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … in an unusual position today in seeking the indulgence of the House to make a speech in accordance with the conventions attached to a maiden speech having … previously made a number of other speeches in the House associated with my ministerial responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
           In that maiden speech, Simon said that a strong, proactive and independent trade union movement is 'a bellwether of a strong democracy'. This is of course something that remains the case today.
          </p>
          <p>
           Simon's strong association with the union movement began through the storemen and packers union, which then became the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union" rel="nofollow">
            National Union
           </a>
           of Workers and is now the United Workers Union. The latter two unions are ones which I also had the opportunity to work for. Simon's contributions were legendary in the union. The fight to win superannuation for warehouse workers and the fight for women workers were visionary and demonstrated Simon's deep dedication to social justice and improving the lives of all Australians, especially those who lived on the margins or were overlooked.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the United Workers Union office in the Docklands in Melbourne, there is a small historical display. Of course, Simon features heavily in this. His photos and campaigns sit in glass cases. These are positioned just outside the training rooms, and thousands of union delegates and members have viewed these over the years and been encouraged by the struggles and sacrifices of the generations of unionists who have come before them—Simon a significant figure among them. Simon's legacy in the union is also remembered in more quotidian ways. Of all the items on display, my favourite is a typed memo from Mary Landeryou to Simon Crean sent on 16 July 1975. It reads: 'Where is the sandwich toaster?'
          </p>
          <p>
           Simon proved to be visionary in so many ways. In his first speech, he clearly articulated the need to invest in environmental protection, to invest in technology and science, so they could play a role in a sustainable future for our nation. This was over 30 years ago, and his words are as relevant now as they were then. He could see where the future might take us, and, as always, was able to join the dots to tackle the challenge that was presented to the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           As well as being a leader of the trade union movement in Australia through his role as President of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Council
           </a>
           of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Unions" rel="nofollow">
            Trade Unions
           </a>
           , Simon of course ascended to the leadership of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           and distinguished himself at the time as courageous and compassionate when he spoke out against the Iraq war, against then Prime Minister Howard's decision, whilst still supporting our troops and their bravery and sacrifice. I will never forget watching Simon's speech in the House of Representatives when
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W_Bush" rel="nofollow">
            George W Bush
           </a>
           visited Australia and he told the President of the United States of America he disagreed with the war. It showed his character: unflinching, principled, with ideas deeply considered. I have no doubt at all that I would not be standing in this House today if it weren't for Simon Crean.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over 10 years ago now, I was at a crossroads in my life. I was on a path to an academic career, something I'd worked hard towards; living and working in Sydney, away from my family. I enjoyed my job but was contemplating a way to combine my love of ideas and research with work that might make a different sort of impact in a different way. A friend let me know that Simon was looking for someone to work for him; he'd be up in Sydney and wondered, would I like to meet up with him and have a chat? I said yes.
          </p>
          <p>
           I remember that day, and I remember being so nervous to meet the politician who, for most of my childhood, had been my local MP. I remember how proud the local community was when our representative, the member for Hotham, became the leader of the Labor Party. Simon was a significant figure, and—even though I was so anxious on my way to meet him I got off at the wrong bus stop on a route I knew well, and had to run the last 500 metres to make the meeting on time—Simon put me at ease immediately and offered me a job on the spot. This set a new path for me in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
           That was in 2013, and I started in a week in March, here in Canberra, at a time that was particularly difficult for the government and for Simon. But Simon ultimately did not let the turmoil of that period get in the way of championing the issues he cared about: the regions; the arts; industry policy; trade; opportunity and prosperity for all in Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           Simon was unrelenting and fierce, kind and thoughtful. He could weather the political storms, the highs and the lows inevitable in this life, with good humour and a steely focus on outcomes that would be good for our country. Simon was not easily driven to distraction and had the remarkable ability to see both the big picture and all the fine details. He always believed working people deserved bread and roses: bread—fair wages, decent conditions and good jobs with a secure safety net; roses—arts, time for creative pursuits, to learn and the opportunity to enjoy and share in the many cultures that make our community so vibrant. This was reflected in the cultural policy he launched 10 years ago. Simon's wife, Carole, noted at his funeral that he would want Australia to vote yes for the Voice. Simon was also a staunch advocate for reconciliation and First Peoples' rights. The cultural policy he oversaw in 2013 placed
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           people at the heart of the government's work.
          </p>
          <p>
           Simon was a remarkable person who served with distinction and integrity. He was a generous boss who took the time to develop my interests and support me in my own career, first in the trade union movement and then here in parliament. Simon's seat of Hotham joins Chisholm, and the boundary movements over the years have meant we have shared representation of many of the wonderful communities in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, a place he loved. Simon was
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Chancellor" rel="nofollow">

           , the place where he studied as an undergraduate, and was engaged in so many important local initiatives and advocacy, including in technology, manufacturing and infrastructure for the area. I was so grateful for all of Simon's support. His advice throughout my election campaign and once I made it to this place is advice I will cherish forever.
          </p>
          <p>
           I last spoke to Simon a few months ago. He gave me good guidance as always. I'll miss Simon. I know this is a sentiment shared with so many. Simon's family were the most important people in the world to him. Again, my condolences are with Carole, Emma, Sarah, David and all those close to Simon at this painful time. Vale, Simon, and thank you for everything.

            Many knew
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
             Simon Crean
            </a>
            far better than me. But I knew him just enough to know that he was one of life's gentlemen, a man of principle and a man of honour. His record of achievement over a lifetime, both within this place and out of it, will surely stand the test of time. Son of Whitlam minister and deputy prime minister
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Crean" rel="nofollow">
             Frank Crean
            </a>
            , he was perhaps destined to be a Labor luminary. I can only speculate, but I suspect his decency was a gift of his parents and upbringing. Mr Crean's achievements were legendary: leader of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
             ACTU
            </a>
            for five years, frontbencher under four Labor prime ministers, and opposition leader for two years. The portfolios he covered were incredible: regional development, local government, arts, education, employment, workplace relations, social inclusion, trade, primary industry, energy, science and technology. There is barely an inch of the public landscape that his life did not cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps more importantly though, Mr Crean was the member for his beloved Hotham for over 23 years. He was a Victorian through and through and a rusted-on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
             North Melbourne
            </a>
            supporter. Simon Crean did it all. Sadly, fate would ensure that he never did get to offer himself at an election for the position of Prime Minister. But, in reality, that didn't matter. His place in Australian history, especially Labor history, is secure regardless. In all reality, Mr Crean was not only a Labor champion but a champion for all Australians. That he was a member of Labor royalty is beyond doubt, and this in no way made him feel entitled or special. He was a friend for all and an enemy of none.
           </p>
           <p>
            Several years ago, I had the absolute honour to sit next to Mr Crean at a fundraising function for the former member for Werriwa Laurie Ferguson. I was the president of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEC" rel="nofollow">
             FEC
            </a>
            at the time and a very newly elected councillor, and it fell to me to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
             MC
            </a>
            the event. I was nervous at the prospect of meeting someone of Mr Crean's stature in the Labor Party. He was someone I had admired for many years. But, instantly, upon our introduction and sensing my nervousness, Mr Crean put me at ease. He was naturally warm and extremely approachable.
           </p>
           <p>
            On that evening, Mr Crean was engaging. He asked questions and truly listened to what I had to say. He offered helpful advice. He made you feel like you were important, not the other way around. He was encouraging in his speech about the party and its prospects. His speech was a real call to action for all true believers. I saw his speech when he took the Labor Party through the reasons why we should not join the war. It was a time when I was really, truly proud to be a Labor person, because he said what so many of us in the party were thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since his passing, I have read and had the privilege to see so many wonderful tributes by those who knew Mr Crean so well, but what has been particularly encouraging is that those words have been spoken by not only members on our side of parliament but former members on both sides of the Treasury benches. I think we can all agree that Australia is better for his contribution and life, and we can all affirm our belief in his core belief that being better for all comes through everyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is entirely appropriate that this great Australian was afforded a state funeral. The one regret, of course, was that the offer had to be made so early and that Mr Crean's life was cut short so early. It's not lost on anyone that he passed away promoting Australian interests on a trade trip overseas—always at work, always achieving, always doing good and always determined to the very end.
           </p>
           <p>
            I offer my sincere condolences to his family and friends, especially his wife, Carole, and daughters, Sarah and Emma. We all wrap our love around you at this difficult time. I also offer my condolences to the current members for Hotham and Chisholm and the member for Macnamara. Their words after Mr Crean's loss were beautiful and heartfelt, and I know how much so many of us here will miss him. Mr Crean's family has lost a husband, father and grandfather. Labor lost a champion, Hotham a friend and the nation a role model and example. It was a sad day, but so much that he left behind means that we will go on and do the best that we can for Australia and its people.

             on his passing. Simon was a true hero of the Labor Party and the wider labour movement. He was a great champion of Australian workers and those who needed a helping hand in life. Simon Crean spent his entire career working to ensure all Australians could share the benefits of our international trade and economic development. He followed his father into parliament, with

             , Simon played a crucial role in bringing about the Hawke government's accord between unions and employers in 1983. The accord, as we all know, was an extraordinary success, leading to industrial disputes dropping dramatically and employment growing strongly. Simon Crean would go on to become President of the ACTU from 1985 to 1990, and in 1990 he was elected as the Labor MP for the seat of Hotham, which started an extraordinary 23-year career in federal politics.

            <p>
             His time in parliament saw him rise to become the leader of the federal Labor Party, and he served as a cabinet minister in the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments. When he first came to parliament, Simon immediately entered the Hawke ministry as Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. He would hold the portfolios of primary industries and energy and employment, education and training under the Hawke and Keating governments before leading the federal Labor Party from 2001 to 2003.

             As leader of the Labor Party, Simon showed incredible courage in opposing the deployment of Australian soldiers to Iraq. Though he opposed the deployment, he made very clear at the time that he had the deepest respect for Australia's military and would take every opportunity to address ADF personnel when they were deployed. In farewelling the service women and men from the

             Following the 2007 election, Simon returned to cabinet as Minister for Trade, where he played a key role in negotiating several international trade agreements, including the

             free trade agreement and Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement. He also commenced the free trade negotiations with China, Korea, Japan and our near neighbour Indonesia. He would go on to become minister for employment, workplace relations, social inclusion, regional Australia, regional development and local government before his retirement from parliament in 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even after his political career, Mr Crean continued to promote free trade as a pathway to economic prosperity as chair of the European Australian Business Council and chair of the Australia-Korea Business Council. I entered parliament after Simon retired, but I had the pleasure of engaging with him extensively in my role as shadow minister for trade. I was struck by his warmth, intelligence and generosity and saw firsthand his dedication to our country and his deep understanding of the importance and benefits of international trade and, critically, how the benefits from that trade must flow to the wider community. He will be missed by the European Australian Business Council; the advocacy he did for the Australian-European Union Free Trade Agreement is the stuff of legends.
            </p>
            <p>
             Simon left a remarkable legacy. His entire adult life was committed to helping improve the lives of Australia's workers and for the benefit of the nation. He was a lion of the labour movement and he will be sorely missed. Many MPs here in this place knew him much better than I did, and I extend my condolences to them and, of course, his many friends. I also want to extend my most sincere condolences to his wife, Carole, and to his whole family. The loss of a loved one so suddenly is heartbreaking. Nothing can take that heartbreak away. Only happy memories make the pain bearable, and I trust his family and friends will continue to think of those happy memories and remarkable legacy for a long time to come.

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
               Simon Crean
              </a>
              , which is something that I was hoping to do, but I understand that it was indeed a fitting farewell and a fitting tribute to what I believe was one of Australia's great statesmen of recent decades. I first met Simon over 20 years ago—perhaps closer to 25 years ago. Simon was then deputy leader of the Labor Party and in opposition, and I was the mayor of the city of Salisbury. I invited Simon to visit our city because he was someone from Canberra I respected as having a really good understanding of regional affairs and local government. He came out and we met with the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
               CEO
              </a>
              at the time—Stephen Hains, myself and Simon—and discussed a whole range of matters with him. I was immediately struck by his breadth of knowledge, understanding of issues and his honesty. Simon from then on became someone I considered I could talk to about matters regardless of whether they were to do with local government or politics more broadly. Even though he was in Canberra and I was in Salisbury, I considered him someone that I could contact if I needed to get some knowledge about a matter I thought affected our city or the country more broadly.
             </p>
             <p>
              Simon subsequently became Labor leader and, because of my early connection with him, I watched with interest how he conducted himself. Others have spoken about his honesty, particularly with respect to the Iraq war, but there were also a number of other matters he led the way on with respect to Labor policy. It was the way he was able to bring people together and his sense of inclusivity that I think made him the person that he was and supported and admired by so many.
             </p>
             <p>
              As history shows, Simon was a very loyal Labor person who always put the party's interests ahead of his own. Indeed, in December 2003, when he stepped down as Labor leader, he did so again in the interests of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Labor Party
              </a>
              because he believed that a new leader might have a better chance of winning the 2004 election for the Labor Party. I cannot recall too many political leaders in the decades I have been watching politics willingly step down from a leadership position because they believed it was in the interests of their party to do so, but Simon did. I think that was, indeed, a measure of the man.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2006 he faced a preselection contest in his own seat of Hotham. I can recall that very well as well. I called Simon to wish him well in his efforts there. It was interesting that Simon, because of his own personal standing among the people he represented, easily prevailed in the local branch election that ensured that he was to continue as the member for Hotham. He did that without any support from any other senior Labor figure at the time. He did that truly by himself. Again, I think it speaks so much of the person that he was prepared to not only take a stand when there was little help from others around him but also take a stand because he believed it was the right thing to do, and the stand that he took was supported by the people he represented.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2007, when I was preselected to run for the seat of Makin, Simon in turn supported my campaign. His support was invaluable. He came out to the electorate on a couple of occasions and we visited different places. Again I felt so much confidence because of the fact I had Simon Crean backing me and standing by my side as I contested the election in 2007. Ultimately I was elected, in no small part to the support that Simon gave me. His support was, indeed, invaluable.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2010 Simon asked me to be a member of a committee that looked into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. As a
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              n he knew I had interest in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Murray" rel="nofollow">
               River Murray
              </a>
              . An inquiry took place that was headed by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Windsor" rel="nofollow">
               Tony Windsor
              </a>
              , the member for New England at the time. That inquiry effectively became the foundation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan we have today. Simon wanted South Australia to be represented on that committee and asked if I would be a member of that committee, and I was.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was, in fact, one of the most interesting inquiries I have been a part of during all my time in this place. It was a very in-depth and extensive inquiry. We went right throughout the basin. We listened to communities in each and every town that would have been affected. I can recall that at the time we wrote the report we literally went through the report line by line, which is not often the case with parliamentary committee work.
             </p>
             <p>
              I felt honoured that Simon had asked me to be a part of that committee. To this day I feel most proud of having been part of the committee that worked on a plan that to this day continues to be debated and is so significant to the national interest. The fact that Simon had confidence in me to be a member of that committee is something I have never forgotten.
             </p>
             <p>
              During the Rudd-Gillard leadership years, when I was here in this place as well, I also noted that Simon continued to always put the party's best interests first. He never took a position because it was in the personal interest of an individual member; he took a position because he thought it was in the party's best interests. I had discussions with him on the very day that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
               Kevin Rudd
              </a>
              lost his leadership. Simon called me and we had a chat about that.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I had ongoing and continuous discussions with him throughout that whole period, which was tumultuous; I don't pretend it wasn't. Again, I always respected his advice and respected him for putting the party first. Indeed, towards the end of all those leadership battles, Simon took a personal stance, again, and only did so because he thought it would be in the party's interest for him to do that.
             </p>
             <p>
              I didn't see much of Simon when he left this place, but we did cross paths on a couple of occasions, and nothing had changed with respect to the character of the man that I always knew. His passing was completely unexpected, and I have to say it truly saddened me. It saddened me not just because it was unexpected but because I felt that I had lost someone that I could always rely on to talk to or get advice from and that I had a great deal of respect for. It saddened me because, quite frankly, I still think he had so much more to contribute to both our nation and global politics. As everybody knows and as others have said, he was actually still continuing to do that at the time he passed away.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe that Australia is indeed a much better place because of Simon Crean's contribution over many decades to Australian public policy. Whether it was through his own personal work in his early days in the union movement or, later on, it was through the diverse portfolios that he held in this place, his contribution to Australian politics is indeed immense. Today I remember and thank a thoroughly decent man for both his friendship and service to our nation, and I extend my sincere condolences to his wife, Carole, his children, his extended family and his many friends.

               My husband, Rod Glover, and I both first met
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
                Simon Crean
               </a>
               when we were what seems now to be very young federal Labor staffers from 1999 to 2001. That was the first time that I got to see what sort of person Simon was. I was a junior staffer who didn't work for Simon and had some but not a huge amount of interaction with him. Every time he saw me, including after 2001, he remembered my name, he knew why he knew me, he asked me how I was going and he asked me how Rod was because we had started our relationship by then. He didn't need to do that, and, every single time, I thought to myself, 'Wow, Simon Crean knows who I am.'
              </p>
              <p>
               Rod went on to be one of many people, like the member for Chisholm, who spoke earlier today, who worked for Simon Crean. Of course, that's how we got to know Simon quite well over the last 25 years. As Rod has said to me, when you talk to people who have worked for Simon, many of whom Rod and I count as very close friends, you realise that you become part of the Crean family, a family with a rich Labor tradition, with its
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Park" rel="nofollow">
                Middle Park
               </a>
               base over many decades. Simon's passion and generosity invoked in his staff a fierce sense of loyalty, and I've also seen the love that it invoked from his staff to him.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is what Rod remembers: that Simon worked hard and loved life. He was a champion of Australia's soft-power engagement with our region, where he saw the transformative power of international education and cultural and sporting exchange. He valued relationships with our region and beyond. He was also passionate about these things at home, as those at

               </a>
               say, that going to the Tamworth Country Music Festival with Simon Crean would have to be, I think, one of the highlights of Rod's life. Were you to ask him to list the favourite things that he has done in his life, I'm pretty confident that Tamworth with Simon would come before our wedding! I'm pretty confident!
              </p>
              <p>
               Rod is now a professor of political leadership, and one of the things he does is talk and lecture about different styles of leaders—the difference between leaders who think and act incrementally and those who think bigger and bolder. And Rod is the first to say that Simon's instincts were very rarely, if ever, incremental. He was always hungry to debate the biggest ideas and tackle the hardest issues. He was always prepared to hear a different view and respect it, and I know that Simon and Rod had some ding-dong battles and conversations in Simon's office—because that's what he wanted: he wanted a robust contest of ideas. He was also prepared to take a position, as many have talked about, even when it was not popular.
              </p>
              <p>
               My great friend Dr Pradeep Philip, who is also one of Simon Crean's alumni, says this about Simon:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               His moral courage is a real lesson for us in leadership roles in both public and private sectors. It goes to duty of public life and the living of a good and ethic life as an individual. But moral stance is not abstract it is real and tangible and this is why his Iraq war position is so resounding—the position was moral and how he conveyed it was practical. That's a great exemplar of public life.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pradeep remembers in particular two things about Simon that he wanted mentioned. One was attitude, and we've heard people talk about this: every problem has a solution. That was Simon's attitude. You just have to work hard at it, and you need to get the right people around the table to pick it apart and then to solve it. The second thing was Simon Crean's approach: if you aren't at the table, you can't negotiate an outcome, so find a way to get yourself at the table.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a boss he always let everyone have their say, because if you are heard then you feel included, even if the final decision is not what you had advocated. As Pradeep has said, this is why Simon attracted people around him who stuck with him for a long time, people who worked for him but also well after—because they were part of the Crean family. These were his enduring human and leadership characteristics.
              </p>
              <p>
               Simon didn't represent Dunkley, as we know. But, after he left politics, he joined my community as the chair of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McClelland" rel="nofollow">
                McClelland
               </a>
               Sculpture Park and Gallery, which is in Langwarrin. It's hard to remember exactly when, because, as Carole said to me when I spoke to her on Monday, time has changed shape with everything to do with Simon since his sudden passing. But I think it was this weekend or certainly not long, in the weeks to come, that Rod and I were supposed to be having lunch with Simon to talk about McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery—to talk about its future and its sustainability, and to join the dots, to strategise, about how we could make sure that this jewel in my community's crown remains.
              </p>
              <p>
               The board and the staff of McClelland gallery want to express their great sadness at the passing of Simon Crean. He joined the board in May 2021 and assumed the chairmanship in April 2022. He made an enormous contribution during his service to McClelland through his wisdom, energy and experience. He was a leading figure in the political, industrial and cultural life of Australia for many decades, and as a former federal arts minister be brought to the McClelland board an unparalleled mix of expertise in industry, politics and the arts. I know as the local member I quite enjoyed being able to say to the board, 'You've got the expert as your chair. I don't know if I've got the solution for you, but I'm sure Simon Crean will.'
              </p>
              <p>
               He was instrumental in the development of the Creative Nation policy, which informed the new Creative Australia policy, and, in his own words:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I've long held a passion for the arts. It's not just the enjoyment they bring, I see the artist as central to us a nation and to securing its future.

               The board and staff of McClelland and the people of Dunkley extend deepest condolences to Carole, family and friends, and mourn the loss of Simon Crean. And, on behalf of Rod and Pradeep and all of our friends who admired and loved and worked with Simon, I know that we're going to miss that crinkled smile and the twinkle in his eye, and the 'let's talk about how we can get this done' conversation; and feel truly privileged to have shared a small part of the life of the legend and the man that was Simon Crean. Vale.

                <p>
                 As has been evidenced by many contributions during this condolence motion—it seems now a bit obvious to make this statement, but I think it's important to say it—
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
                  Simon Crean
                 </a>
                 was a man of courage and conviction. It is, frankly, an honour to have the opportunity to stand in this place today to remember a life well lived—a life lived in service to a country that he, and we, love deeply and a life lived in service to the working men and women of our nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Simon Crean, you could safely say, was born into the Labor Party, and he was one of our party's great stalwarts. He was a trade union leader, a member of parliament, a community advocate, a minister and a leader. Simon Crean spent his working life bettering the lives of other working Australians. He also spent a great deal of time bettering the country to ensure our nation would reach its full potential. Nowhere was this more evident than in the work he did in the portfolios he held. As Minister for Industry and Science, it would be remiss of me not to reflect on the fact that Simon Crean's first ministerial appointment was as the minister for science and technology. In that role, Simon was a great champion not just of Australian science in general but particularly of Australian research and of ensuring that Australian research could be harnessed in the national interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On 14 March 1991, Simon announced one of the most enduring legacies of the desire to fuse our research know-how with Australia's economic success. On that date he announced the first tranche of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Research_Centres" rel="nofollow">
                  Cooperative Research Centres
                 </a>
                 program. For over 30 years, the CRC program has been a critical part of Australia's innovation architecture. It's a proven model that suited Simon Crean because it uses industry-led collaborative research to solve problems by working together to deliver real outcomes. It spans industries as diverse as manufacturing, agriculture, recycling, artificial intelligence, aerospace, energy, health and mining, to name but a few, translating homegrown research into commercially viable products and services that will generate new businesses and new jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The numbers speak for themselves. Since Simon Crean launched the first CRCs back in 1991 the program has committed over $5 billion of grant funding to support the establishment of 236 CRCs and over 200 shorter-term CRC projects. Collaborative partners from industry, research, government and community organisations have all matched this funding, with commitments of close to $17 billion in cash and in-kind contributions. On announcing the first group of CRCs, Simon said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Australia must match the technology push provided by its strong research base with the demand pull of industry and other research users …
                </p>
                <p>
                 He said the CRCs:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 … reflect the balance between longer-term strategic research and short-term, market-oriented projects that is essential to forging the links we need between science and industry.
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 The centres will also play an important role in training in science and engineering research, providing the skilled people we need to be internationally competitive into the next century.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's the task Simon Crean set for the CRCs, and they've delivered on it many times over.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The CRC program is a great example of what is possible when we back Australian know-how. When we get industry-research collaboration and cooperation, we get things right. It's a task that still faces us as policymakers today. It's a task that this Labor government is keen to continue. We are keen to build upon the work that Simon Crean started.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On another matter, a lot has been mentioned in this place about Simon Crean's courage and humanity, especially in disagreeing with the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" rel="nofollow">
                  Iraq War
                 </a>
                 . That was a particularly difficult stand to take at that point in time, considering the pressures that he would have faced in making that very big call. Today I want to mention another little-known example of Simon Crean's courage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On September 11 2002, the first anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Simon was invited to speak at the service to honour victims. However, for whatever reason, the government of the day decided and determined that the readings would be made from one holy book at the commemorative service, despite the fact that many different people of many different faiths were victims in that horrific attack. Simon Crean decided we could be bigger than that. So, first, he read a message from the Bible that he'd been asked to read by the organisers, and then he did something that reflected his utter humanity. He said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 And if I may add a further brief text.
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 "Oh, mankind, we created from you a pair of a male and female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other, not that ye may despise each other."
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 That too is from a

                </p>
                <p>
                 As one of his former staffers and someone I'm proud to call a friend, Kirsten Andrews, wrote years later:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Despite the political risk for modern politicians in pointing out the obvious - that Islam is a religion of peace, he—
                </p>
                <p>
                 Simon—
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 decided he couldn't let the opportunity pass him by. It was a small, underreported moment in the life of a politician, yet it was also a moment of true leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That innate goodness, that ability to recognise the humanity of others, was a manifest part of the Simon Crean I knew and worked with in this place.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Post politics, he continued to serve. He made the case for Australian science and research and know-how, through his work with

                <p>
                 He wasn't just a great Labor stalwart. He was a great Australian who served his country and his community with deep passion. If all of us in this place could serve our country half as well as Simon Crean did, we would achieve a great deal.
