       <p>
        I am very proud to rise this morning to share with you some of the wonderful achievements of the constituents of Forde.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Park Ridge Pirates, a junior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        club, and their president Andy Colenso for their recent success in the AFL Brisbane Junior Gala Awards. They were successful in taking the top honours of the Neville Blunt Club Championship Award. This award was won by achieving the highest percentage of wins per games played in the competition. The awards also recognised the efforts of local Beenleigh youth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who was named Youth Coach of the Year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also in sport, Windaroo Valley State High School has completed a stunning comeback to extend one of Logan's longest runs of sporting superiority. For over a decade the school has been unmatched in the Pacific District Athletics Championship, and has now secured its 13th consecutive title.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also proud to report that one of my constituents, Mark Cummins—the primary caregiver of eight children between the ages of 15 and 32—has won the title of Queensland Father of the Year. This is a tremendous achievement for a father who has raised eight children, two of which suffer from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_Fibrosis" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a number of positive stories in our local community, where locals reach out to brighten up the lives of others. One such story is that of Ela Gibson and the women of the Logan Wish Group who secretly spoil people in the local community and put others before themselves. They spoil people like carers of children or family members by treating them with pamper packs and letting them know that they are appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also had one of our local constituents, who is a heart attack survivor, complete a 100-kilometre bike ride to raise funds for multiple sclerosis.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Booth" rel="nofollow">

        admitted that he did not know anyone personally with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS" rel="nofollow">

        , but wanted to ride because it was about mateship and looking after each other—another great example of our wonderful local community spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally in the good news stories, I have had two constituents reach a very important milestone in the electorate: we have celebrated two 100th birthdays in recent weeks.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         George Hill
        </a>
        , who was born on 4 September 1912 and Mrs Eileen May Fallu who was born on 6 September 1912.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst I had the opportunity to attend Eileen's birthday at Coomera, I missed the opportunity to attend George's at Burnley Sports Club. It would have been great to have been at George's birthday because I heard he had a waltz with 10 ladies—something he does regularly every week. I certainly hope that I can be around at 100, let alone waltzing at 100.
