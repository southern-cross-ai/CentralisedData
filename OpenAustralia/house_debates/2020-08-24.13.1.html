       <p>
        This presentation of petitions and ministerial responses is exceptionally large. This is partly due to changes in the sitting pattern because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of the high level of public engagement with petitioning that we continue to experience, which is great to see.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 79 petitions presented here today represent the diverse Australian community and their genuine concerns. Some petitions address contemporary issues, such as COVID-19, and others are concerned about longstanding issues like technology advances, taxes, education and immigration, to name but a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        By initiating, signing or promoting a petition through the e-petitioning system, or by signing a paper petition at a community event, local church or shopping centre, each person that has had involvement in these petitions has actively engaged with parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a committee we encourage this engagement, safely distanced of course, and also call on our fellow members of parliament to continue in their support of the right of a citizen to petition the House. Fellow members, if you are contacted by a constituent regarding a petition, you may consider presenting the petition on your constituent's behalf. You may also contact the secretariat for assistance in facilitating this process or to obtain advice for your constituent on the correct form and content for a petition. They are there and willing to help, and these actions will further assist in promoting citizens' engagement with parliament, and to allow individual voices to be heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Speaker. I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the committee.
