        Leah is a member of my local community and a proud early childhood educator, and she has been so for over 31 years. Leah understands how precious the early years of a child's life are to the development of the adult who emerges thereafter.

Labor stands united with women in the pursuit of fair pay, and Labor stands united with the early education seconder too. If we're not prepared to pay our educators what they deserve then the future is bleak. We'll continue to lose quality educators with enormous passion for our kids—
