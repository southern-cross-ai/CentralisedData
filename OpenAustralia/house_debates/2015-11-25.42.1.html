       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge Jake Hiscock today. Jake is a local Lismore mechanic, for Lismore Car Repairs. This year, Jake received the apprentice of the year award from Wollongbar
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        . As part of this award, Jake was nominated to compete in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldSkills" rel="nofollow">
         WorldSkills
        </a>
        Competition in August of this year. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldSkills_Competition" rel="nofollow">
         WorldSkills Competition
        </a>
        gives apprentices like Jake the opportunity to showcase their trade and skill on a regional, national and, hopefully, international level. Jake competed in the regional competition in Kingscliff, where he took home the gold medal. Thanks to his hard work and dedication, Jake is now one of only 10 mechanics going to compete in the national WorldSkills finals in Melbourne. What makes Jake's story truly inspirational is that he had to overcome hurdles through his school life. His last three years in high school were very tough ones as he watched his sister Danielle battle with leukaemia. Unfortunately, Danielle lost her battle in December 2011—the same year that Jake was meant to complete his final year of high school. I would like to congratulate Jake on his success so far and wish him all the best in Melbourne—I know his mum, Tanya, is very proud of him. I congratulate Terri McPherson and the whole team at Lismore Car Repairs.
