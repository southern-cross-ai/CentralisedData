        I would like to congratulate the organisers of the 50th anniversary celebrations for the town of Weipa in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        last July. Weipa is situated on Albatross Bay on the western cape peninsula between the Mission and Embley rivers. In 1967 the Queensland government named the area Weipa North. It was the site for a newly established Comalco mining town. Today it is known only as Weipa, and is the home to a very vibrant community of around 3,500 people. Weipa is steeped in natural beauty and Indigenous cultural heritage, and is the perfect starting point for anyone wanting to explore Cape York's amazing beaches, unspoiled wilderness and incredible fishing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Weipa Town Authority put on an outstanding weekend for those who have played a part in shaping Weipa into the town that it is today. Events included a reunion, historical bus tour, cricket match and gala dinner, and community festival. It was wonderful to share my reflections of Weipa, which go back to the 1970s, and catch up with people who were the real pioneers in their day and hear their amazing stories as we celebrated how much the town has grown. As development south of the Embley River progresses and the bitumen continues to snake towards Weipa, its long-term future as a thriving and diverse city of the western cape is absolutely assured. Congratulations to the Weipa Town Authority and all of those associated with the organising of this event on your terrific 50th anniversary celebrations.
