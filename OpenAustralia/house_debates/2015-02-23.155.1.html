       <p>
        I rise today to reflect on the many ways in which our government is driving jobs growth across Corangamite and the Geelong region. At a time when manufacturing, in particular, is under pressure across our region, our government is rolling out a range of funding programs, reforms and new investments to protect and create long-term sustainable jobs, not the bandaid solutions that we saw under Labor.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund has already created 750 new jobs. It now sits at a value of $29.5 million after our government negotiated a $5 million contribution from Alcoa. Our $155 million Growth Fund, which includes a $60 million Next Generation Manufacturing

        </a>
        and the National Stronger Regions Fund. We are seeing some great applications into those funds, and they will be announced shortly. We are also going to roll out our $30 million regional Infrastructure Fund. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the people of Geelong will have their eye firmly on how that can drive jobs investment across our region. We brought to Geelong the ABS Centre of Excellence—250 jobs; the National Disability Insurance Agency headquarters—300 jobs; and a $500,000 Geelong employment connection program to fund local jobs programs. The abolition of the carbon tax is making a real difference. At

        Softwoods, they are saving $600,000 by not paying the carbon tax, and that is going into new investments.
       </p>
       <p>
        In raising these various initiatives, I do call on federal Labor to cease its relentless campaign of negativity because it has the potential to cause real damage to investment confidence across our region. In the

        </i>
        on 20 February, the member for Corio said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The federal government has let manufacturing die in Geelong—it’s time they do something about our jobs crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an absolutely disgraceful statement, which not only is false but also demonstrates the extent to which federal Labor is working to drag down our region. There are 500 manufacturers in our region. They are responsible for something like 40 per cent of our region's economic output and are employing around 12,000 people. This is a reckless statement by the member for Corio. Every member of parliament, no matter from what side of politics, has a responsibility to be a champion for our region—and our community will not cop this. Geelong is a thriving region. That is why I am fighting for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAND" rel="nofollow">
         LAND
        </a>
        400; it is such an important project. That is why we are fighting to build the East West Link and the 7,000 jobs which Labor is trying to destroy. I will not let Labor's negativity damage our region. We are a great place to live, to work and to invest in jobs.
