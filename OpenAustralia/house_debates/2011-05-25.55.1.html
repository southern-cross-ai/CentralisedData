       <p>
        On 11 May I brought to the attention of this House the urgent matter of unpaid accounts to 56
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        subcontractors amounting to some $600,000 for work done at

        , Bungwahl and Coopernook schools. I have written to the Prime Minister, but to date there has not even been an acknowledgement of the letter, let alone any examination of the issue. It makes these tradies cringe every time they hear a member of the government stand up and say how this BER program saved us from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
         GFC
        </a>
        . Prime Minister, if this program was to stimulate local economies, please explain how that has been achieved when these subbies are still owed $600,000. Labor plays hide and seek when it comes to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        projects in Paterson. When a BER project is finished, Labor seeks out the media and sends Senator Forshaw to spruik the program. But when there are problems with a BER project, Labor is nowhere to be seen. Just last week Senator Forshaw attended the opening of BER projects at Morpeth, Grahamstown and Tenambit, but could not find time to meet with the subbies that have not been paid. Labor has failed to act for those subbies who are now struggling to survive. But Labor are not alone. I am now informed that the member for Lyne,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Oakeshott" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Oakeshott
        </a>
        , has also fobbed off the subbies, most of whom are his constituents, despite being advised on this issue back in October last year. What happened to his passion for representing his constituents with his all new powers? Again I call on the Prime Minister to intervene and sort this mess out before its too late for these people.
