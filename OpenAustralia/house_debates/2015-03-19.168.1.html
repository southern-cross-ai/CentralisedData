        I rise to inform the House that this Saturday, 21 March is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Harmony Day
        </a>
        . Harmony Day is a very special celebration of our multicultural Australia, a nation we share with people from many different backgrounds. The motto 'everyone belongs' is very apt for this occasion. Harmony Day is a day of cultural respect for everyone who calls Australia homeâ€”from our Indigenous population, the traditional owners of our land; to our English settlers, who set up new homes; to each and every subsequent wave of migration: those who have come to Australia for a better life. Harmony Day on 21 March celebrates Australia's cultural diversity, and our policies of inclusiveness, respect, and a sense of belonging for everyone. Harmony Day also coincides with the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Since 1999, Harmony Day has been celebrated across our schools, community groups, churches, businesses and governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        This day is particularly important to the constituents of Barton. Barton is one of the most culturally diverse electorates in Sydney and in Australia. My constituents come from over 160 different nations and speak over 43 different languages, and this is an amazing statistic. In fact, 45 per cent of all Australians were either born overseas or have a parent who was. They have all come to this land to build a brighter future for their families. What unites us are our shared values of mutual respect, diversity and tolerance.

        Prior to becoming the federal representative for Barton, I was a councillor for and Mayor of Kogarah
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         City Council
        </a>
        , where we regularly hosted events for Harmony Day, in collaboration with local schools. This is something that I am very proud of, as it espouses the kinds of values we want in our young people and our fellow citizens within our multicultural society. Although we all demonstrate cultural awareness and respect in our daily lives, having an official day allows us to reflect the achievements that this important recognition brings. As such, I am very proud that, in my electorate of Barton, there will be a range of activities and celebrations taking place in the lead-up to and on the day of this wonderful event.

        Kogarah Neighbourhood Centre in Kogarah will celebrate local artworks by children in their before- and after-school programs, as well as the morning tea held on 18 March. Rockdale children's centre, a long day care facility, will have activities and celebrations on 20 March, and, over in Bexley, the St George Migrant Resource Centre will have an array of cultural corners in the Bexley Scout Hall on 21 March. The centre is hosting a specific Arabic cultural day with various performances, children's activities and delicious food on offer. Kogarah City Council recently ran a creative writing competition in honour of Harmony Day titled Everyone Belongs, and the winners of this will be announced at a special event on 20 March in Kogarah Town Square. A few suburbs over in

        , St Finbar's Catholic Primary School will host a school fair celebrating multiculturalism in our school community and around the country. At the other end of the electorate, the Australian Lebanese Hawkers Rugby Union Football Club will organise and host a sevens championship tournament, in conjunction with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rugby_Union" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Eight to 10 teams are being invited from various rugby-playing multicultural communities in Australia to play on the day at Wills Ground in Earlwood. These fantastic events are open to the public, and I urge my constituents to attend at least one of these, which showcase the wonderful electorate of Barton.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1999, communities all over our country have decided how they would like to come together to mark the occasion. Some have morning teas, others organise a fair, and some celebrate by dressing in national costumes. Since 1999, more than 55,000 Harmony Day events have taken place, with nearly 6,500 events registered in 2011. Orange is the colour symbol chosen to represent Harmony Day. Fellow Australians are encouraged to wear orange clothing or the distinctive orange ribbon to show their support for cultural diversity and an inclusive Australia. I look forward to these wonderful events, and I wish the organisers every success in their celebrations.
