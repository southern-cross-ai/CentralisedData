         I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. The

          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         is the centrepiece of the government’s measures to tackle the threat of climate change. The greatest barrier to the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the disunity of the opposition. It is clear, of course, and has been for some time that the coalition is clearly split, with the Nationals having gone off on their own course of action.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">

         and National parties are fundamentally divided over the issue of climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Joyce is spearheading the campaign against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme even to the detriment of rural communities. The government announced over the weekend that we would agree to exclude agricultural emissions from the operation of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
          CPRS
         </a>
         indefinitely as part of a package negotiated with the opposition. In addition to that, the government indicated that we would consider a range of ways in which the agriculture sector could reduce its emissions, including by it being able to generate offsetting credits. It is a significant step that would allow farmers the incentive to sequester carbon. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFF" rel="nofollow">
          NFF
         </a>
         , the

          National Farmers Federation
         </a>
         , and other farming groups have welcomed that move. What has Senator Joyce got to say about this issue? When asked on

            Senator Joyce was asked on

             </a>
            </i>
            : ‘Do you want carbon offsets for the farming community?’ Senator Joyce’s reply was: ‘No. And I want a little red car for Christmas and, if I can, I will take cupid wings and fly around the room.’ That is the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. It is not a wonder he is doing the chicken dance if that is what he is endeavouring to do. Senator Joyce has taken his party far beyond the edge of relevance and credibility in this debate.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the problem is not just the National Party.

            </a>
            s appear to have fallen into two camps on this particular issue. The first camp, led by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom, are obviously supporting negotiations with the government. We are wondering whether the member for Mackellar might be one of the 10 people in the Liberal party room today who, we understand, did not support that position.

               Uncle Wilson has come to the wedding. That is the first camp. The second camp is the one populated by the climate change sceptics. No lesser political figure than the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, Senator Minchin, sees the global efforts to combat climate change as some form of international left-wing conspiracy—a new communist front. This is what he had to say on the
               <i>

              <p class="italic">
               For the extreme left it provides the opportunity to do what they’ve always wanted to do, to sort of de-industrialise the western world. You know the collapse of communism was a disaster for the left, and the, and really they embraced environmentalism as their new religion.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate carrying on about a communist conspiracy that is the basis for taking action against climate change. This puts all the major world leadership, including other political figures and including the Leader of the Opposition, in a communist conspiracy. That is what climate change is all about, according to Senator Minchin.

              <p>
               But we have the other side of the spectrum represented in the Liberal Party as well. The member for Hume had a different take on this issue in his second reading contribution on the bills. Instead, he suggested that climate change science is the modern equivalent of Nazi science. This is what he had to say:

                   I simply say to the Manager of Opposition Business: if he really wants me to take the point of order seriously, I wish he would resume his seat and await a response. Whether he believes that he has been provoked or not, entering into a discussion is not very helpful. The question was in order and the minister is responding to the question.

                     I know you do not like hearing it, but you are going to hear it. This is what he quoted of

                    <p>
                     The member for Hume then went on to say:
                    </p>
                    <p class="moved">
                     That is just as applicable today to the perverted science of global warming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     That is unbelievable. That is a completely incredible contribution. For political figures with the responsibility of people such as the member for Hume and the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, Senator Minchin, to engage in such bizarre, ridiculous and absurd nonsense is extremely irresponsible, given the threat that this country faces. No modern political party can be held captive by climate change sceptics and hope to retain credibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Prime Minister made the point earlier that the member for Groom had indicated some optimism that a potential agreement with the government may obtain support in the Liberal party room. We hope that is the case. We continue to approach these negotiations in good faith. We will endeavour to secure an agreement and we are hopeful that it will obtain support in the Liberal party room because it is important to this country’s national interest to tackle the threat of climate change. The sceptics and the extremists need to be cast to the edge.
