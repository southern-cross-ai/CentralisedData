        I have a question to you. I refer to page 548 of
        <i>
         Practice
        </i>
        , 'Rostering of ministers', where it says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although there is no rule to this effect, it has been traditionally expected that all Ministers who are Members of the House, unless sick, overseas or otherwise engaged on urgent public business, will be present at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time" rel="nofollow">
         Question Time
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the Deputy Prime Minister isn't able to attend question time in person because of the issue of COVID in the New England region, but I do note how many of my team, including my deputy, are here every question time, participating in the parliament. I would have thought that that is appropriate. My question to you is: is it appropriate, just as the Prime Minister took questions virtually and was available, that the Deputy Prime Minister should be available during question time for members of parliament on both sides and on the crossbenches to hold him to account and ask questions? I note that he hasn't turned up but he is on the payroll, and it is expected as a minimum that ministers will be here.

        <p>
         I'll make a couple of points to the Leader of the Opposition. What the ministerial arrangements are obviously have nothing to do with me. That's a matter for the government. In terms of those participating remotely as a result of the agreement, all members have the option to participate remotely if they're unable to be here. I won't go through all the aspects of the agreement, and I don't know all of the circumstances. The requirement is that they're trained—they're trained in their electorate offices—and they participate from their electorate offices, for the reasons I've outlined at great length before: for the best possible connection. They participate in a way that's as similar to parliament as it is, with parliamentary attire and a parliamentary backdrop. But it's not compulsory. That's really all I can say on the matter. But, while I'm at it, I will commend the member for McMahon for having the best backdrop that I've seen. And I think if everyone models themselves on him, that would be good.
