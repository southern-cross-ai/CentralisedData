        I would like to pay tribute to a wonderful lady from my electorate, Kay Sidman, who will hold her 12th Biggest Morning Tea event for the Cancer Council tomorrow. So far, Kay has raised more than $193,000 for the cause, making her one of the country's top fundraisers for the Cancer Council. With the help of the Macarthur community, she hopes to crack the $200,000 mark this year. Kay holds a morning tea every year in memory of her sister Jan who died of cancer in 2004. In a recent media interview Kay said that each year she hoped the money she raised 'would help kill this dreaded thing called cancer'. Kay's Biggest Morning Tea draws huge crowds and has grown much bigger than she could ever imagine. This year guests can enjoy massages, aromatherapy, tarot card readings, food, drinks, a chocolate wheel and a fashion parade. I think it is fantastic that one lady can inspire so many people to come along and support her event.

        This year the Campbelltown Lions Club will fire up the barbecue. Many locals have donated items and vouchers, including one local family who have donated hundreds of dollars in fuel vouchers for the event. Kay Sidman is a great asset to her family and the Macarthur community. Her love for her sister is now helping thousands of Australians who benefit from the work of the Cancer Council. The money she raises each year brings us one step closer to finding a cure for cancer. I would like to publicly commend Kay for her great work and her commitment to the cause. I join the Macarthur community in being very proud of her achievements and I know her sister Jan would be very proud of her efforts too.
