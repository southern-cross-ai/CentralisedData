         The member for Mayo will resume her seat. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition: I can't hear the question being asked. The member for Mayo has the call, and I'll get you to start your question again.

          Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience. The Drought Communities Small Business Support Program has helped many off-farm rural businesses in my electorate who've experienced hardship caused by drought, bushfires, hail damage and COVID. This program is doing a power of good for rural businesses right across Australia, so why is the government ending this funding at Christmas?

           I thank the member for her question and acknowledge the hard work that she has undertaken during last year's

           events and the impact it has had on her communities. The government isn't ending these programs. In fact, we've put it as part of the new Recovery and Resilience Agency, led by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Stone" rel="nofollow">
            Shane Stone
           </a>
           . We're working through those contracts not just with respect to small business but also with the Rural Financial Counselling Service. We've gone out to those particular providers to make sure that the support that is provided to them is adequate in understanding the demand that will be required moving forward and understanding that the recovery time for these communities is different. Every community heals differently.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are working with them, through Shane Stone and his agency, and the Rural Financial Counselling Service, who have led this process for us because they have the experience and the corporate knowledge with which to run out to farmers but now also into small businesses. The agency will be making further announcements soon with respect to furthering those contracts and the resourcing, working across the nation, understanding that the demand shifts in some regions are different to others and how we can move some of those people into the regions where there is still demand.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is being handled as delicately and openly as we possibly can. I know that Shane Stone is working with people on the ground. We've tried to make sure that this has been a locally led recovery, of having boots on the ground and having people from his agency sitting around kitchen tables understanding exactly what you have been able to articulate: the demands that are out there for these people to get back up on their feet. I'm happy to make sure that I can provide you with further details specific to your counselling area. If there are inadequacies, I'm happy to make sure that we can facilitate that with Mr Stone.
