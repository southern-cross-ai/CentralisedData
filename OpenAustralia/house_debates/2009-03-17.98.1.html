        I rise today to talk about four members in my electorate of Maranoa—four people who have worked hard for the people of Queensland and who are ready to make a change for a better Queensland. These four people have a lot in common but they share one very special quality: they are part of a team, a team that will help Queenslanders this weekend become part of the new Queensland government. This team, which represents the state electorates that come under Maranoa are ready to deliver a better Queensland, not only for Queensland’s regional communities but for all Queenslanders—from banana farmers in the north to tourist operators on the

        and to the farming and rural communities in western Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        This team I speak of, and of which I am extremely proud, consists of:

        As members of the LNP they are ready to take on the challenges that face the sunshine state. They are ready to end the 11 years of failed Labor government, which has resulted in Queensland having a $74 billion debt. Where did all the money go? Where did all that money go from the mining boom? It did not go into the health system. It did not go into the regional and rural roads. If Labor can take Queensland into a $74 billion debt, during these good times of a mining boom, how can we trust

        and the Labor Party to manage the economy in the tough times? Queensland deserves a team who can manage the economy, return our health care to a respectable standard and provide us with an education system that we can all be proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Queensland right now, under Anna Bligh and the Labor government, they are actually borrowing the money to pay the nurses, doctors, teachers, police and emergency services personnel—this is the disgrace of the Labor government in Queensland that will be thrown out of office this weekend. The LNP members in my electorate are part of a new team—
