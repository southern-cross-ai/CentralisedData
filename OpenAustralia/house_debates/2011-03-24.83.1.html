        The YMCA New South Wales Youth Parliament, which convenes, for the 10th consecutive year, in 2011, is a highly prestigious forum for young people to learn about and participate in the parliamentary process. The youth parliament brings together young people from across New South Wales who are nominated and selected by New South Wales members of parliament to represent the young people of their electorate on issues of concern to them. Typically, these young people are high achievers academically, with a strong commitment to community services and a desire to make a real difference in the lives of residents in their electorates. They are passionate about making their local communities a better place in which to live and want to improve their skills in public speaking and leadership. I congratulate Paige and Blake on their successful selection to participate in the
