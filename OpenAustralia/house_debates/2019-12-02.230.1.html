        Waheguru ji ka khalsa waheguru ji ki fateh. It's my pleasure to rise in support of the motion from the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        . I'm very pleased that this motion has come back to the chamber, which gives me the opportunity to expand on some of my previous comments to the House and extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Australian Sikh community on the momentous occasion of the 550th anniversary of the birth of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak" rel="nofollow">
         Guru Nanak
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Guru Nanak was a leader, teacher and social reformer. Although he may be long gone, his teachings have had an enduring impact on the world, and he was indeed ahead of his time. He taught that the worth of a person was not determined by some innate quality, be that their gender or a social label, like the family into which one was born, but rather the way in which one interacted with one's neighbours and the world. Guru Nanak maintained, 'He who regards all men as equals is religious.' He rejected the caste system as antiquated and ridiculous, often resulting in strong criticism from many of his contemporaries. His recognition of the role of women in society and teachings about the equality of the sexes is an enduring legacy of the Guru's time on this earth.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guru" rel="nofollow">
         The Guru
        </a>
        's emphasis on love and respect are everlasting, and, particularly during what can often feel like an increasingly divisive time in which to live, these lessons are as relevant as the day he taught them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the wonderful opportunity and the great honour to celebrate this anniversary in Sydney and in my local community with so many Australian Sikhs from all walks of life. For example, Sikh Youth Australia hosted celebrations in Pyrmont which were a beautiful reminder of the way in which the Guru's teachings helped inspire and energise Sikhs hundreds of years after his birth. I acknowledge the member for Werriwa in the chamber: there were tremendous celebrations with the Sikh community in her electorate in south-west Sydney too, as well as right across west and north-west Sydney and, indeed, right across Australia.

        is continuing to grow. It's only fitting that this place should acknowledge the values of a religion that fits so well within both the Australian narrative and the Australian identity. Selflessness and social justice are quintessential Australian values. Lending a hand to those in need is something that Australians will always continue to do. We've seen that recently, with the terrible bushfires that have caused so much devastation: ordinary people doing extraordinary things. On that note, we saw the selflessness and community-mindedness of Sydney Sikhs when members of the Guru Nanak Gurudwara in Turramurra delivered food to volunteers from the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Support Rural Fire Brigade. The Guru would be so proud of your dedication to community. I want to acknowledge those Sydney Sikhs and also our many firefighters who have truly gone above and beyond to keep us safe in weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the federal member for Greenway, I have the privilege of representing a vibrant and welcoming Sikh community in north-west Sydney. Having worked closely with the community over many years, I say with all sincerity how grateful I am for your passionate advocacy and commitment to improving both our local community and this country.

         I rise to support the motion and thank and congratulate the member for

         </a>
         for his ongoing contribution to his diverse and multicultural community. Like the honourable member, my electorate of Werriwa has a strong and proud history of many religions, cultures and backgrounds. One of those religions, Sikhism, last month celebrated a significant event: the 550th birthday of its founder,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak" rel="nofollow">
          Guru Nanak
         </a>
         . Sikhs have a long history in this nation, dating back to the first half of the 19th century. Despite their small numbers, they've made a significant contribution and played a hand in many of this country's major historical milestones—they were at the gold rush, they fought in both world wars, including the Gallipoli campaign, and they made a sizeable contribution to our agriculture sector, especially in bananas and sugarcane.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sikhism has grown rapidly over the last decade and is now the fifth-largest religion in Australia and the sixth-largest religion in my electorate of Werriwa. I'd like to take this opportunity to make specific mention of two Sikh organisations doing great work in my local community. The Sikh Mission Centre at Austral has been serving its local Sikh community since the early 1990s. For close to two decades, the centre has provided the community with religious service at the gurdwara and vegetarian meals out of its kitchen. It held its celebration for the birth of Guru Nanak in late November. While I was unable to attend, I am well informed that the event was a great success. I congratulate Bawa Singh, the team at the Austral Sikh Mission Centre and all of the devotees for the great work they've done in our local community over 20 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Turbans 4 Australia, a Sikh organisation based in my electorate, held their celebration for the birth of Guru Nanak in early November. The event featured a parade through the streets of Liverpool, followed by an event in Bigge Park. The event was very well attended by local Sikhs and wider members of the community, with stalls, performances and vegetarian meals for all in attendance. I also commend Turbans 4 Australia for a recent community campaign to assist our fellow Australians suffering from the tragic bushfires, particularly on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         north coast. The Sikh community came together, gathered their donations, filled a truck full of pallets and drove it from Sydney to the north coast and onwards to Tenterfield. Under the banner of mates helping mates, these amazing people donated their time, resources, money and possessions to ensure that our bushfire victims got just what they needed. Turbans 4 Australia are regularly involved in charity drives and are always willing to lend a hand to their fellow Australians. Like all Sikhs in this country, they make a contribution to our multicultural nation through the values first inspired by Guru Nanak over five centuries ago and shared by their fellow Australians: selfless service, social justice and equality.

          I'm very proud to have the opportunity to rise very briefly to make some remarks in support of this very important motion. I want to acknowledge and congratulate my friend the member for

           McEwen

          </a>
          are both equally proud to represent, in our neighbouring electorates, a large, vibrant and growing Sikh community and, through them, to have been introduced to the tenets of Sikhism, tenets which have a great impact on how I see the world as well as how I go about my business as a member of parliament.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was very pleased to have the opportunity to play a role in this place in various celebrations reflecting the 550th anniversary of the birth of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak" rel="nofollow">
           Guru Nanak
          </a>
          . I joined many of my colleagues, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Grayndler, in paying tribute to Guru Nanak, the 550th anniversary of his birth and his enduring significance, not only to the Sikh community but also, through the celebrations, to the wider Australian community. I say to all those Australians who practise Sikhism: I acknowledge what a wonderful occasion this has been and I look forward to joining you in carrying on the celebrations.
