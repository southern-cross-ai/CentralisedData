       <p>
        Throughout the electorate of Longman we have a wealth of business men and women who are proud to serve the community and their customers. One such businessman is Ross Cutts, who is the branch manager of Repco Morayfield. On Monday night, Ross received an award for his 50 years of service—that's right, 50, five zero—with Repco and became the first inductee into the Repco hall of fame. Congratulations, Ross. Thank you for your many years of service and for your tireless efforts in serving the community you know and love.
       </p>
       <p>
        From a young age, Ross wanted to work in spare parts and follow in the footsteps of his brother and father, who were motor mechanics. He left school at 15 to follow that dream. Ross is another example of someone making a career for themselves without having any form of higher education. He is testament to what can be achieved through good old-fashioned hard work in a job that you love.
       </p>
       <p>
        After getting his start as a young lad with Repco, he would later move to the Caboolture branch, in 1994, before that business moved to the neighbouring suburb of Morayfield. Since then, Ross has built a strong rapport with local customers, as well as with the staff who work with him on a daily basis. Ross has so much passion for what he does, the people that he works with and the company he works for, and that truly shines through when he speaks about his job. Maree, who works with Ross in his office, has also been there for 30 years, so this is obviously a great place to work. Thank you again, Ross; we need more people with your kind of passion, loyalty and dedication.
