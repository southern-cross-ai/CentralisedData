        I rise in the House tonight to speak on the issue of bullying. Rueben Cunningham, a constituent in my electorate, contacted my office earlier this year with a plea for help. His daughter, Chloe, was severely bullied during her school years. Her story is quite terrifying and with her permission I will share it with you today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The severe bullying started when Chloe was in year 7. Chloe has said that food was thrown at her, drinks were poured down her back, there was name-calling, exclusion from groups and relentless Facebook bullying. She relocated schools three times. The bullying continued through her high school years and, when she was 18, the effects of bullying manifested themselves in severe physical symptoms. She stopped eating, lost 10 kilos, her kidneys failed, she had short-term memory loss and was in constant pain. She was in a wheelchair for four months, spent a number of months hospitalised and her symptoms led the medical profession to think that she could have motor neurone disease or

         MS
        </a>
        . Luckily, Chloe has made a full recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rueben has now started an organisation called Angels Goal with the intention of educating kids in schools about the effects bullying can have on a person. He is so passionate on this matter, contacting schools, MPs, local councils and sporting and community groups to get his message out. His plan is to get school children to sign a pledge to affirm that they will not bully others. This is to create awareness and encourage accountability. Rueben would also like Angels Goal peer support networks in place to help those who have experienced bullying. His next aim is to create a mentoring program for workplaces.
       </p>

        Bullying in all its forms is basically an abuse of power by someone who is stronger—physically, verbally, mentally, socially, electronically, politically or financially—towards someone who cannot block the bully's games and cruel behaviour. Threatening behaviour is unacceptable and reflects on the judgment and intelligence of the perpetrator. Bullying causes damage to everyone concerned: the target, onlookers, families, the school, the workplace, employers and the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Technology is now often used as the medium for bullies to hurt their victims. Fights are being filmed and placed online, inappropriate pictures and text messages are being sent, and insults are being thrown around on Facebook. Young people—indeed all of us—need to understand that our behaviour can be broadcast worldwide, and it is very difficult to get that content deleted. The damage it can cause includes physical, psychological, social and identity injuries. It can affect studies, careers, relationships and financial wellbeing. It can cause severe mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, lasting many years, or conversion disorder, like Miss Cunningham.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are being bullied, it is important to remember that you are not to blame and that there are steps you can take to stop it. Bullying is a serious matter and no-one should have to put up with being bullied. In March this year the Gillard government launched the new Bullying.

        of Action Against Bullying and Violence. We have also launched the cybersafety help button, a free desktop application for kids which provides information about counselling services, reporting abuse and dealing with online risks like cyberbullying.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cyberbullying is an increasing problem, with most kids having access to a handheld mobile device and regularly interacting with social media. This is a serious problem that we need to direct more attention to, and I know Senator Bilyk in my home state of Tasmania has been a big advocate of this. Cyberbullying presents us with a range of new challenges, but we are committed to working with parents, students and schools to tackle this important issue. Confident, happy, resilient children do better at school and are more likely to lead happy and positive lives. We are working with states and territories to implement the National Safe Schools Framework, which will support schools to take a proactive approach to developing safety and wellbeing policies, and addressing bullying.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank Chloe for being so brave and telling her story. I congratulate her dad for his action. Earlier this year we celebrated the National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence. Let us vow to make every day a National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence. Let us make all parliamentarians demonstrate leadership and be exemplary in this area.
