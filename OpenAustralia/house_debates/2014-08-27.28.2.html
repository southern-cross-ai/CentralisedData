       <p>
        I rise to speak about the devastating fire in the town of Nimbin in my electorate of Richmond in the early hours of Wednesday, August 13. The fire destroyed some very well-known buildings in townâ€”the Rainbow Cafe, the Nimbin Museum, the Tribal Magic shop and part of the Bringabong shop in Cullen Street, the main street of this iconic town.
       </p>
       <p>
        These buildings were so much more than just timber and tin. They housed a rich history of Nimbin and reflected its unique culture and lifestyle. I went to Nimbin recently and saw firsthand the damage caused by the fire. It was devastating to see so much history gone; so many of the locals and tourists were visibly upset at this huge loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rainbow Cafe was a very busy eatery and a popular tourist destination. It was one of the biggest employers in town with 20 employees. It has been run for the last 10 years by Jodee Tichborne who said: 'The Rainbow Cafe was the heart and soul of Nimbin.' She has indicated that rebuilding is on the cards.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Nimbin Museum's founder and owner, Michael Balderstone, is also a well-known and respected figure in town. Michael spent three decades building and working on the museum. The museum depicted the rich, colourful history of the town, from telling the stories of the local Indigenous culture right through to those of the world renowned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Aquarius Festival
        </a>
        which Nimbin is famous for. Michael Balderstone best summed up the feelings of many in saying Nimbin was a resilient community and would rebuild; but the museum is gone forever. Sadly, too, the buildings also featured murals, some of which dated back to the Aquarius Festival. Praise should go to the more than 30 firefighters who fought the fire and prevented what could have been a far worse outcome.
