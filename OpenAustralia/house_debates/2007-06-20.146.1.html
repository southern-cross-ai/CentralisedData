        I
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ " rel="nofollow">

        rise to speak on behalf of people with physical disabilities. In recent years quite a number of these men and women have been able to overcome some of their mobility problems by having wheelchairs and cars which permit them to drive themselves to work, to the shops and so on instead of relying on others. This is a huge improvement to their independence and quality of life and this obviously should be supported and encouraged.
       </p>
       <p>
        One such disabled person, a constituent of mine, spoke to me regarding the extreme difficulties he has refuelling cars at petrol stations. He is wheelchair bound. These days very few filling stations actually have driveway service, so there is no-one there to help him. You can imagine the difficulties that these disabled drivers face getting out of their vehicles and into wheelchairs or, at the very least, onto crutches. There is also increased danger for these drivers if the service stations are very busy, with cars whipping in and out of fairly restricted spaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        My constituent made what I think is an excellent suggestion and one that I hope will be adopted by more socially responsible oil companies and petrol station managers. He suggests that two or three times a week, the morning or afternoon shift changeover could be extended by half an hour so that there is a period where there is a spare person who can assist disabled people to fill their cars, check oil and water, clean windscreens and so on. This is obviously also a safety issue. The days and times of this special service should be advertised. For example, there could be a sign in the window so that people will know when they can benefit from this service. These signs could be similar to the roster signs which displayed when petrol station hours were rostered. This would be a very small additional cost for petrol companies but would have an enormous benefit for some people with disabilities. I wish to encourage all companies and managers to support this excellent idea.
