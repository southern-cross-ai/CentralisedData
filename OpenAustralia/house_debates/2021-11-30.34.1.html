       <p>
        [by video link] Last week I received an email from Rachel Crosswell, the Tasmanian coordinator of the charity Hope in a Suitcase. When kids are placed in emergency care, they often leave with simply the clothes that they're wearing on their backs. If they're able to grab a few things, they're luckyâ€”throw it in a plastic bag, maybe. Hope in a Suitcase's mission is simple: to provide each child with their own suitcase filled with items like toiletries, clothing, something to cuddle, a blanket and a few things for fun. The suitcases are a vital reminder that they are loved and have worth at a time that they need it most.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hope in a Suitcase relies on donations from the public in order to undertake its important work. It's no surprise that on the north-west coast of Tasmania donations are pouring in. Burnie's Carmen Guard, an active foster carer, has been instrumental in that. Carmen has helped Hope in a Suitcase get up and running along the coast, and she is currently the sole drop-off point for donations.

        in a Suitcase to continue to do their important work, they're looking for more businesses to be used as drop-off points for donations. My office has put up its hand, and I'm encouraging other businesses right across our region to consider supporting this great local charity. Please get in contact with my office if you feel you can help give these kids hope.
