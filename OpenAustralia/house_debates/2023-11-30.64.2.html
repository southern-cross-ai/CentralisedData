        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, Australians are facing a cost-of-living crisis. The government has wasted $450 million on the Prime Minister's Voice referendum and $250 million on monitoring hardcore criminals that did not need to be released. So will the Prime Minister rule out wasting more—

The government has wasted $450 million on the Prime Minister's Voice referendum and $250 million on monitoring hardcore criminals that did not need to be released. So will the Prime Minister rule out wasting more taxpayers' money on creating up to 53 new federal politicians and 200 or more staff who would come with them?

           <p>
            I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question, which goes to an attack on the existence of politicians. And on the suggestion that some politicians are a waste of money, I think he's right. Over there you could have one of those buttons that you press and it just says no in different ways: no, no, no, no, no. You could set that button up over there, and no matter what the legislation was, you could press the button and there it would be: no, no, no!
           </p>
           <p>
            You know you have really hit the bottom of the barrel, when it comes to desperation, when a politician who's the leader of a political party thinks it's okay to just say, 'Oh, we want less politicians.' This is the mob, across the Liberal and National parties, who recently had the largest international parliamentary delegation since Federation. Fifteen of them went to a conference in London: the members for Cook, Hume, New England, Wannon, Fairfax, Mallee, Bowman, Berowra, Canning and Groom—and that's before you get to the senators.

               Resume your seat. I don't think anyone could argue that that question was tight. It contained the issues of the cost of living, the referendum and immigration and also the issue of new politicians and the cost that comes from that. The Prime Minister has one minute to continue about the broad-ranging nature of that question.

                  It was a conference about the future, with guest speakers such as
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
                   John Howard
                  </a>
                  , who went along to say, 'Multiculturalism is a concept that I've always had trouble with,' and
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
                   Tony Abbott
                  </a>
                  , saying that climate change was both 'ahistorical and utterly implausible', peddled by a 'climate cult'. That's what they see as the future. They went all that way to bag multiculturalism and to bag climate change.
