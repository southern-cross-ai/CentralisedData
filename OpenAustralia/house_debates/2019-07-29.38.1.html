       <p>
        I wish to reflect to acknowledge and reflect on the recent passing of a much-beloved member of our community, Rachel Whitford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APM" rel="nofollow">
         APM
        </a>
        . Rachel was an amazing woman who dedicated her life to her family, her friends and her work and to the community of Logan. For many, Rachel was a trusted friend and someone to look to for help and support. For over 20 years she served the Logan community and devoted herself to a number of community organisations in a wide variety of roles. Her most significant contribution to the community would be her almost 22 years of service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Police Service
        </a>
        . In recognition of Rachel's service she was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        in the

        honours in 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was also branch manager of the Logan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        for many years, where she oversaw the delivery of vital programs to the youth of Logan. She also served as chairperson and board member of Access Community Services before going on to chair the board of Access Community Enterprises Limited and, most recently, as director of the board of Access Group International.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her leadership and contribution to the community is a source of inspiration for those who have had the pleasure of meeting and working with her. Rachel was a truly selfless person who gave much of her time and energy to helping others and she will be sorely missed by her loved ones and by those who knew her.
