        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House what measures the government has taken to address the decision of the parliament, moved and supported by the

        <p>
         I thank the member for the question. It's something I thought the opposition might ask me today, but they clearly have no interest in the consequences of the weakness that they displayed in this chamber yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that last night the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

         met with the Operation Sovereign Borders personnel. This morning the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
          National Security
         </a>
         Committee of cabinet was convened to address this very question. We took the advice and recommendations of our security and border protection agencies—something the leader of the Labor Party failed to do when he came into this place yesterday and wilfully weakened Australia's border protection regime. The recommendations we have taken are to strengthen the posturing, positioning and resources of Operation Sovereign Borders, as required by those who advised us to do so. Secondly, we have commenced the process of reopening
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         —as recommended we do—to deal with any possible future arrivals as well as any transfers that may now take place. I have also asked the home affairs department to provide advice on the implementation of the measures that were set out in the parliament yesterday and were voted upon, moved and supported by the Labor Party in defiance of the national security advice that they were very well aware of.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is an eerie ring to what we are hearing. The Leader of the Labor Party stood here last night and he talked about getting the balance right on border protection. I remembered that phrase very clearly because there was another Leader of the Labor Party who said just that. It was
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         . He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our policy is clear-cut. It's balanced … we've got that balance right.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's a balance that led to 800 boats, 50,000 arrivals, 1,200 people dead at sea, all on the heads of those who sit opposite, all on their heads—on your head, your head, your head and your head! They were all there, willing it on. I remind him of the words of Senator Evans, the Minister for Immigration under the Labor Party, who said: 'The scrapping of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPV" rel="nofollow">
          TPV
         </a>
         s fulfils the Rudd government's commitment to providing a fair and equitable outcome.'

           He said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           …the measure would not compromise the Government’s commitment to protecting Australia’s borders.
          </p>
          <p>
           He said that on 13 May 2008. And we know what followed. That set the boats running again.
          </p>
          <p>
           This leader of the Labor Party does not have the strength to lead this country, to keep Australians safe and secure, and he demonstrated his weakness in this place yesterday, beyond measure. The Australian people have got this man's number. It comes up a big, fat zero when it comes to strength to secure our borders.
