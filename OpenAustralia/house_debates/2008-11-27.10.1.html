         Senate amendments (1) to (109) amend schedules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the

          Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Bill 2008
         </a>
         . The amendments also amend clause 2 of the bill, which provides the commencement dates of the schedule to the bill. These amendments were proposed by the government in the Senate. A number of these amendments implement recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to the bill, and I would like to commend the work of that committee in respect of this matter. These amendments will make a number of changes to those schedules of the bill, including amending references in the bill to ‘the product of a relationship’ definition of child to instead refer to ‘a child of a person’ within the meaning of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law Act
         </a>
         1975 and removing amendments relating to the concepts of ‘legal responsibility’ and ‘custody, care and control’. The amendments also remove the amendment inserting a definition of ‘de facto partner’ into the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 as the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 will now insert this definition into the Acts Interpretation Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         The passage of this legislation—which I assume will take place, given the opposition has indicated its consent—will complete the process of removing discrimination from a wide variety of Commonwealth laws identified by an extensive audit of those laws as a result of considerable work by the department and the Senate committee to which I have referred. I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous work undertaken by the Attorney-General’s Department and senators and members of the House who have made a constructive contribution to the debate. At the end of the day, I think it is quite a significant event for this parliament to confirm that at long last we have removed discrimination against same-sex couples from Commonwealth laws.
