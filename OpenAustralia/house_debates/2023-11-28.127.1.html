        I want to acknowledge 90 years of the Kyogle branch of the United Hospital Auxiliaries of

         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Its dedicated volunteers raise funds to purchase needed items and medical equipment for the Kyogle hospital. It's very active, with 35 members, and it has been operating since 1933. I want to acknowledge the current executive members:

        , Joan Low, Carolyn Barnard, Tom and Betty Fitzgerald, and Grace Dwyer. Since 2019, they've donated $85,000 towards developing a residential aged-care activity and lounge room. I was very happy to get a grant to facilitate that. It's a safe area in the hospital which connects residents with loved ones. I thank all of the current members of the hospital auxiliary for what they do for our community.

        competed in the Catholic Schools Debating Association competition held in Sydney last week. They competed in a regional final and then went on to compete in the state final competition. Year 8 students Judy Irwin, Arliah Hartley and Paisley Padayachee received runners-up in the regional competition. And year 7 students Maya Conaghan, Willow Rowney and Amiah Carroll won their regional final, as did year 9 students Aaliyah-Scarlett Roach, Emily Newman and Poppy Ross. They all went on to compete in the state championships, where they debated that religious schools should be banned and that school should not be dealing with contemporary political issues. Both teams finished second in the state. I thank the teachers and coaches Maria Rouse, Linda Gleeson and Leanne Kelly. McAuley Catholic College is a wonderful school in our community, and I congratulate them on their debating success.

        I want to thank Di Weeks, who has retired after working as a cleaner for 41 years, and 22 of those years were spent at Woolgoolga Public School. Di began in the public works at the Woolgoolga Police Station and then moved on to the Department of Education. She cleaned Mullaway Public School,

        and then Woolgoolga Public School. She is married to Bob and has two children, Fiona and Todd. In her retirement, Di is looking forward to travelling to

        I would like to thank Izzy Miller for her selfless and quick-thinking act of courage and bravery this week, when she took control of her school bus to avoid a major crash. On 22 November, Casino High School student Izzy was onboard her afternoon school bus when it started rolling away, as the driver was not present in the bus. It was heading towards oncoming traffic, parked cars and the North Casino Mini Mart. Izzy bravely took control of the wheel and steered the bus and all its passengers to a safe stop, which narrowly avoided a potentially major incident. Well done and thank you, Izzy.
