        I want to talk to you about beautiful Warringah, and in particular the Manly Scenic Walkway, which is regularly touted as one of the most beautiful walks in Sydney. I would argue that it's one of the most spectacular in the world. It has 20 kilometres of bushwalks that run from Spit in Mosman to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Head" rel="nofollow">
         North Head
        </a>
        in Manly. The walkway meanders through beautiful native bushland and past harbour beaches and bays. This beautiful walk is just one of the many exciting holiday activities that Warringah offers in summer, and that's why we are calling on everyone, from both within Warringah and outside Warringah, to have a staycasion and rediscover Warringah and our local area. It's so important at a time when international borders are closed that we plan holidays at home and make sure we support our local tourism and hospitality industries. Across Mosman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        , tourism and hospitality employs over 13,000 people and contributes over $2.5 billion to the economy, so supporting these local businesses is good for the community, good for the economy and good for the soul. I absolutely urge everyone to come and discover. Maybe come and have a ride on the Manly ferries that are currently under threat. There is a strong push from the community to maintain the Manly ferries as they are very important to tourism in Manly. They bring thousands of people to our shores and it's very important that they be valued for what they represent. This is not a commuter mode of transport; it is for tourism.
