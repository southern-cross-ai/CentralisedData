        It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak about a very brave young man from my electorate who is raising money and awareness for juvenile diabetes. Will Cullen, from

        , is seven years old and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes five years ago. He is the

        campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I met Will recently, I was inspired by his positive attitude and his dedication to raising awareness and money to help find a cure for diabetes. He showed me how to do a finger-prick blood test to check his sugar levels and shared his wish with me that one day there would be a cure for diabetes. When I asked Will's mum, Mel, if he would need to take medication and monitor his sugar levels for the rest of his life she said yes. But Will was quick to correct her. 'Not for the rest of my life, Mum,' he said, 'just until we find a cure.' He has such a positive attitude for such a young child. This is why I am very proud of Will and I think he is a fantastic ambassador for juvenile diabetes and for all the children and families in Macarthur who live with the condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year, Will and his family and friends take part in the Walk to Cure Diabetes and have raised more than $30,000 for the causeâ€”a great achievement that they should all be very proud of. When Will comes to Canberra in November for the Kids in the House diabetes event, I hope to introduce him to my colleagues here in parliament. I am sure that he will touch their hearts just like he has mine and encourage all of us to do everything possible to support these brave young Australians living with diabetes. Keep up the good work, Will. You are an absolute champion.
