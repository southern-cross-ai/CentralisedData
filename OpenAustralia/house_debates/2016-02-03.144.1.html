        I rise to pay tribute to some outstanding people in my electorate of Robertson, who were recently honoured as part of the Australia Day Community Awards hosted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford City Council
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        has a long history of great citizens who have answered the call to serve our country and preserve the freedoms that we all cherish. Honouring their sacrifice is no easy task, but Andrew Church has risen to this challenge by establishing the Central Coast Interactive War Exhibit, featuring hundreds of items like uniforms, medals, wartime artefacts and weapons sourced from around the world. It really is an incredible exhibition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opening its doors to coincide with the Anzac Centenary last year, more than 1,000 students,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel, aged care facilities and community organisations have so far seen this exhibit, with plans to attract around 200 students every week this year. I am proud to advise the House that Andrew Church is the 2016 Gosford City Council Citizen of the Year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Young Citizen of the Year is an incredible 14-year-oldâ€”Jessica Atkinson. Jessica developed and implemented a sun safety program for primary school children; her own initiative. Working as part of the Beat the Heat initiative, Jessica's innovation also pioneered an online version of the program, increasing the reach and independent delivery to primary schools around our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also recognised a number of other volunteers who are the lifeblood of our community, including the indefatigable and outstanding Clive Blunt, who was honoured for his tireless work with the Gosford community through not-for-profit organisations such as Gosford City Rotary and, most recently, for his organisation of the upcoming Toast the Coast festival on 2 April at Gosford's Entertainment Grounds. Clive has been working with Coast Shelter to ensure that funds from the festival flow back into supporting domestic violence initiatives at Coast Shelter.
       </p>

        Barney Waters received the Arts, Culture and Entertainment Award for his dedication to the Gosford Musical Society's pit orchestra since 1964. Suzy Miller was presented with an Outstanding Achievement Award for a range of community initiatives, including her local youth mentoring initiative, fundraising and her professional networking group for women. Volunteering Central Coast was honoured for its Community Visitors Scheme, which relies on the commitment and dedication of nearly 50 volunteers. They visit socially isolated people living in aged-care facilities on the Central Coast, and bring hope and support to our community.
       </p>

        A community event award was given to Narara's Ecoburbia Festival, a fantastic celebration of sustainable community development. Last year this attracted 4,000 residents and local business representatives. Our senior citizen of the year was
