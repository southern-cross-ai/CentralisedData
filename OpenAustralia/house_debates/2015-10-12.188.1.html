       <p>
        I rise today to talk about an incredibly joyous occasion that occurred recently in my electorate. I recently had the privilege of attending this very exciting occasion at the Fairways assisted living home at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Heads
        </a>
        . This great occasion was the 75th wedding anniversary of Bill and Flo Robson. Seventy-five years of marriage is a remarkable achievement. This amazing local couple were joined by many family and friends to mark this really important milestone. It was a wonderful occasion for Bill and Flo and their family and I was indeed honoured to have been invited to celebrate this really significant and unusual achievement. It is wonderful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill and Flo have been fortunate to have had such a long and rich life together, and they celebrated with their very large extended family, which included five generations. They have three children, twelve grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and eight great-great-grandchildren. Of course, everyone wanted to ask them what the secret was to such a long and happy marriage, and they said the secret is to always be each other's best friend. That was clearly evident on the day. They truly were best friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill, indeed, is a true gentleman with a very cheeky manner, and Flo is a very kind woman with a really beaming and inviting smile. They are a lovely couple and a wonderful family, and it really was a great occasion to have been there with them to celebrate this remarkable milestone, their 75 years of being married. I would like to congratulate both Bill and Flo for that remarkable achievement.
