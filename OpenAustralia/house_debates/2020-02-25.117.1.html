       <p>
        It's a well known fact that Townsville is suffering significantly from a crime epidemic, and there are very few solutions that have been offered by the state Labor government. The three local MPs sit idly by and do nothing about it, even though it's their job to fix this problem. Despite the federal government having no jurisdiction on crime, I cannot with clear conscience sit by and do nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I was happy to attend a meeting with Geoff and Vicki Toomby at the invitation of the Townsville action against crime committee. Geoff and Vicki run the Ultimate Rural Training Centre, just outside of Townsville, based on the Wonderland Station. Their rural training programs focus on practical experience on the farm. Learning the key skills needed for the industry, successful participants finish with a cert III in rural operations. Geoff and Vicki have hosted dozens of school-age students, many from troubled backgrounds, whose lives have been transformed by the program. In fact, they say they have an 83 per cent positive strike rate, in terms of finding work for participants and getting them re-engaged in their communities. This includes children who have long histories of crime, drugs, and violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the future of the program has come under question, with the state Labor government pulling Geoff and Vicki's funding for delivering their program. The kinds of young people who go through the program are from disadvantaged backgrounds and don't have the means to pay for it out of their own pockets. As the plight of the program has come to light in the media and throughout the Townsville community, there has been a ground swell of support for Vicki and Geoff, in particular for the way their programs could potentially work as a solution for disengaged youth, who are responsible for the bulk of the crimes committed in the Townsville area. They are desperate to help in any way they can, as they too are members of our community.

        Part of the plan would be to get veterans involved as mentors to work with young offenders. I think this is an excellent idea, as we know that there are many veterans in the community looking for positive engagement. There were three veterans present at the meeting, putting their hands up to be a part of it. Many veterans have lived experience of what it's like to do it tough, and have plenty to offer in this space.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge the state Labor government to reconsider the funding for this program, and realise the positive impact it has had on so many young lives. In the meantime, I'll be working closely with the Attorney-General and the Minister for

        to see if there's anything that we can do in the federal space.
