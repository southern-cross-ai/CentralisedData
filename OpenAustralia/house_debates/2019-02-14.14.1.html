        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, the government introduces the additional estimates appropriation bills. These bills are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These bills underpin the government's expenditure decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 3) 2018-2019 seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just over $2.5 billion. These bills also ensure there is sufficient appropriation to cover estimates variations related to existing programs, for instance changes in costs for demand-driven programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline the more significant amounts provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, this bill will provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>

       </p>
       <p>
        Second, this bill will provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        with almost $600 million, including funding for national security, provision of refugee and humanitarian assistance, and investment in critical national capabilities to enhance Australia's natural disaster preparedness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, this bill will provide $100.5 million to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Regional Development and Cities, including assistance for farmers and farm communities in drought.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fourth, this bill will provide $89.8 million to the Department of Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        , including assistance for farmers and farm communities in drought.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, this bill will also provide the Attorney-General's Department with $60 million, including support for the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. The royal commission will primarily look at the quality and safety of care provided in residential and home aged care to senior Australians and young Australians with disabilities living in residential aged-care settings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill would also provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sports_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Sports Commission
        </a>
        with just over $60 million, which includes $30 million to expand the Community Sport Infrastructure Program to provide a greater number of grants for the community sporting facilities, $2 million to fund the development of a detailed business case on options for the future of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Sport" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Sport
        </a>
        site and $25 million to support athletes preparing for the 2020

        </a>
        and Paralympics.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also provide, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
         National Gallery
        </a>
        of Australia with over $14 million to continue to safeguard and exhibit its collection of artworks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill and the portfolio additional estimates statements tabled in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
