        It's always a good time to celebrate our teachers, but, as we near the end of the school year in Tasmania, it's especially fitting to say thank you to the teachers and education staff across all of our schools. I'm sure any parent who has undertaken the task of home learning at any stage recently has a new-found appreciation for what's really required when educating young minds.

        In Tasmania this week, educational professionals were recognised at the 25 Year State Service Awards, including Caryn Kerrison, Jill Fish, Colleen Elliott, Natasha Gibbons, Anthony Leonard, Bronwyn Morgan, Jennifer Radford, Caryn Watson, Marie Stannus, Tony Brazendale, Dearne Lansdell, Marcella Glachan and Sussen Cute. I'm fortunate enough to know a few of the recipients, including Jill Fish, who has I think taught all of the Archer children over many years in

        . He says that his passion for education remains. 'I turn up every day, love what I do, and so here I am,' he said. Riverside Primary School teacher Jennifer Radford always knew she wanted to be a teacher and has spent her career teaching kindergarten through to year 2. Ms Radford sums it up perfectly when she says, 'What we do isn't about literacy or numeracy but rather the relationship we build with the child so that they can become the best person they can be.'
