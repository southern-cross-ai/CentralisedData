        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post

        has announced that it is closing its

        plaza post office on 29 September, and our community is very disappointed about this decision. Australia Post says the closure is due to a 44 per cent reduction in foot traffic. This data has been taken over four years, including across two COVID-19 lockdowns and recovery periods, when it would be logical that foot traffic would be much lowerâ€”including no traffic at all. The next Australia Post post office closest is on the high street of Penrith, which has been identified as a location to take on the majority of customers from the plaza. There are only six car spaces at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        post office and one accessible space. Street parking is very difficult to find. The position of the post office, with cars entering and exiting, is not pedestrian friendly. I don't believe the High Street post office is going to give residents and small business owners an adequate customer service experience, based on the above issues. I want to ensure local services are kept to a high standard and that sites are accessible and easy for everyone in the Lindsay community, particularly for our seniors and local small businesses. I raised the issue with Australia Post, and in parliament this week I asked the Minister for Communications to review the decision. This is an important issue for our community and one that is very much worth trying to find a better outcome on.
