        It is fair to say that Peter Bol was not high in the public consciousness until this week, but his wonderful journey is now playing out before our eyes in Tokyo, with two Australian records in two days in the Olympic heats and semifinalsâ€”incredible achievements, with a strong feeling there's more to come. Tonight he's running in the Olympic final. He has a chance, too. He is on a quest to be Australia's first male individual gold medallist on the track since

        Peter Bol's story is a powerful one, starting with his family moving to Australia after being born in Sudan and spending time in Egypt. But this storyline does not define him. In his own profound way, Peter Bol often delves deeper into that narrative, showing that we as Australians all go through struggles no different to his and that we should get to know the person instead of the assumptions. I've been lucky enough to know Peter and his friend and running mate Joe Deng these last three to four years. From our shared coffee shop, Phat Milk, to helping them find stable accommodation in Niddrie and training with Clementine, it's been my family's pleasure to know them. Determination, focus and energy exude from Pete on the track. It's a reflection of his life journey thus far, his family, and the team and values he surrounds himself with. Hours before the final, Peter Bol is on top of his game. He knows it. He has enjoyed and revelled in

        life. He is calm and focused and not in the least distracted. One more special moment awaits in Tokyo tonight. We're all cheering you on, Peter Bol!
