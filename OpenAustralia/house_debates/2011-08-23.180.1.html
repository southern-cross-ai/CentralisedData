        We are all used to the man of stunts in federal politics but I want to make the House aware of his new apprentice down in Victoria, Premier Ted Baillieu. Today in a stunt the premier went to the school as principal for the day. It is ironic, because at the same time as he did this his government was ripping over $400 million out of the Victorian education system. With his track record on education there is no doubt that today, as principal for the day, he was channelling

        , the horrible principal from the Dahl classic
        <i>
         Matilda
        </i>
        . Miss Trunchbull's idea of the perfect school, she says, 'is one in which there are no children at all', and this seems exactly what the

        wants.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems the Premier's idea of a perfect education system is one where his government spends no money to pay teachers and no money to build schools. Today, as he smiled for the cameras as principal, his Liberal government ripped $12 million out of the

        , otherwise known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAL" rel="nofollow">
         VCAL
        </a>
        . The Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning is a hands-on option for students in years 11 and 12. It provides students with practical, work related experience as well as literacy and numeracy skills and the opportunity to build personal skills that are important for both life and work. Similar to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCE" rel="nofollow">
         VCE
        </a>
        , the VCAL is a recognised secondary qualification, and most students who undertake VCAL are generally more interested in going into training in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        , completing an apprenticeship or getting a job after completing year 12. The VCAL is an important part of education and strengthening the labour force, which is particularly important when we talk about skills shortages. Skills shortages, which flourished under the former Howard government, is only being addressed by the Gillard Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once students complete VCAL the opportunities are endless; they can go straight into employment, apprenticeships or traineeships or are able to obtain a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_II" rel="nofollow">
         Certificate II
        </a>
        , III or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
         IV
        </a>
        and a diploma and advanced diploma. Cutting VCAL is probably one of the cruellest things this out-of-touch Liberal government has done since being elected. We all know that the Premier himself may have been able to afford a very privileged education. We know that he chose to go on to university, but for many students in Victoria it is a far different story. Many students are interested in completing an apprenticeship or going to TAFE and we should be encouraging this and giving students more options, not depriving them of crucial career pathways. This Liberal government, like all Liberal governments, does not believe that is the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        We on this side know that VCAL provides students with a hands-on experience if they choose for whatever reason not to do the VCE. It prepares them for further education and training as well as related work experience and job training. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Curriculum_and_Assessment_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority
        </a>
        , VCAL students gain the knowledge and the skills that assist their preparation towards entering a trade. The On Track destinations survey for students who completed a VCAL intermediate or senior certificate illustrates that 87 per cent of the students followed a pathway to education, training or work after VCAL.
       </p>
       <p>
        These mean, short-sighted cuts are denying our students of the training and the skills they require for jobs and in turn is denying the Victorian economy a strong workforce. Families and, importantly, students in my electorate and across the state will be heavily impacted by these mean cuts and this mean government. They are schools like Wallan Secondary College,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittlesea_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Whittlesea Secondary College
        </a>
        , Broadford Secondary College, all our schools in Healesville, schools in Yea, Seymour, Alexandra, Gisborne, Craigieburn, Mount Ridley and Sunbury College, just to name a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        These savage, mean-spirited cuts to children's education are having a wide-ranging impact on our highly valued local learning and employment networks such as the Central Ranges LLEN and the HumeWhittlesea LLEN. All are highly valued and highly successful organisations delivering real results for our kids. With these cuts to VCAL many schools in my electorate will not be able to give students an alternative pathway and options to VCE. The Baillieu Liberal government's first budget saw $481 million of cuts to education. It seems they believe education is a privilege to be earned and not a right or necessity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Governments should be giving every student every opportunity because when given these opportunities we know that kids will succeed. Not all parents can send their kids to private schools but all Victorian students—no matter where they live and regardless of their parents' income—are entitled to the best quality education system. Thankfully Premier Baillieu was only principal for a day because I would not want to see the further damage he would inflict upon education if he were given that position to any longer period of time.
