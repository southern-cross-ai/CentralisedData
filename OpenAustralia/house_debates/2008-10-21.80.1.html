       <p>
        I rise in this parliament to speak on the issue of Kempsey District Hospital. Kempsey hospital is a good hospital. It has dedicated staff, but it is under-resourced and the buildings are years out of date. Services at Kempsey hospital have been eroded year after year. But people who live in regional areas have a right to quality services where they live; they should not have to drive hours to find appropriate medical treatment. It is essential that Kempsey hospital be upgraded. The community of the Macleay Valley desperately needs a new hospital. A master plan has been developed for a new hospital for Kempsey, but the new wing dates back to the sixties—let alone the older buildings in the complex. The Kempsey District Hospital Action Group has been working tirelessly to convince the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        state government of the need for a redeveloped hospital at Kempsey, but to this point the government has ignored those requests.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to table a petition from the community of Kempsey having in excess of 4,400 signatures and calling on the federal government to provide funding under the national health and hospital fund to assist in the redevelopment of Kempsey hospital. Kempsey hospital has been abandoned by the New South Wales government. The people of the Macleay Valley deserve better.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition has been supported widely throughout the community. The new Mayor of Kempsey, John Bowell, who was a tireless campaigner for an improved hospital, is a keen supporter. Sue Gorman and Liz Campbell, from the Kempsey and District Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have supported the petition.

        , of the South West Rocks District Chamber of Commerce and Industry, supports the petition, as does the wider Macleay Valley business community. Allan Snowsill collected signatures throughout the area, visiting outlying centres such as Bellbrook and Willawarrin, and he collected signatures at the Kempsey

        . The support throughout the community has been tremendous.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise the efforts of the state member for Oxley and Leader of the Nationals, Mr Andrew Stoner, who has been lobbying the New South Wales state government year in, year out but to date without success. The New South Wales state government will not even admit there is a problem with Kempsey hospital, let alone address the very urgent need for 21st century facilities to support the staff and the community of the Macleay Valley. I call on the New South Wales government to get behind the people of the Macleay Valley. I call on the federal government to support the petition and to provide funds available under the national health and hospital fund for a new Kempsey District Hospital to take it into the next century.

        The petition read as follows—
