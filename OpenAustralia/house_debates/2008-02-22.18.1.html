        Mr Speaker, I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That the Speaker’s ruling be dissented from.
       </p>

         standing order 133
        </a>
        (b) it is clear that you have the capacity to order a division of this House. This place is turning into a farce because, specifically, the government has failed to make the Prime Minister and ministers accountable to this House and accountable to the Australian people for their actions. This is not the way we want to behave in the parliament, but if you are going to close down the parliament, if the Labor Party is going to try to close down accountability, if it is going to close down transparency, then we make no apology at all for calling for question time to come on. It is very important that the member for Moncrieff have a voice in this House for his constituents.

         That the member be no longer heard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The question is that the member be no longer heard. All those of that opinion say aye, the contrary no. I think the ayes have it. Division required. In accordance with
         <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=5" title="Deferred divisions on Mondays and Tuesdays    a. On Mondays and Tuesdays,...">
          standing order 133
         </a>
         , the division is deferred until the commencement of the next sitting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Because there has been no completed division, the issue is not resolved and therefore the member has a right to continue speaking. The issue is simply not resolved. You cannot move on to the next item until this matter is resolved. The member has a right to exercise his entire speaking time because the House has not voted that his time has completed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat. This is what the motion before the chair is about. That is the reason the dissent motion is being moved.

           should have his microphone on.
          </p>
          <p>
           I asked the Clerk prior to this day whether the Serjeant would remove anybody who was disorderly, and I was told—

          <p>
           The member for McMillan does not have the call.

           You called him up!

           I thought that this situation may come to what has happened today. I asked the Clerk whether the serjeants would remove anybody from this House, and the answer I got was, ‘Very unlikely; no, they would not.’ I think the member for Moncrieff has been thrown out improperly.
