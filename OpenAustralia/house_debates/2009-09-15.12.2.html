         I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I know that, with her long and strong history in defending the rights of working men and women, she knows what an important issue this is. Australians are rightly proud of the progress that we have made over many years in achieving greater equality between men and women. But, while Australians have changed their attitudes and their behaviours over time, it is a little disappointing to see that the opposition in many respects have not. Yesterday we heard from the member for O’Connor, who said that women want to work part time on the weekends so dad can be home to look after the kids.

           <p>
            Mr Speaker, I was actually going to agree with the member for O’Connor in one respect, which is that that does suit many families. There are many families where they want to have one person working part time. But there are a lot of families where women want to work full time too. It is a little difficult to be the Governor-General or the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
             CEO
            </a>
            of Westpac or the CEO of Heytesbury Holdings and work part time. In fact, there are women all over Australia who are supporting themselves and supporting their kids, struggling along with full-time work—and they are proud to do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is that the modern world has both men and women working and it has both men and women wanting to share the responsibility and the joy of raising kids and looking after a family. Our modern workplace laws have to reflect that. They have to reflect the modern reality that women work part time and full time. Dads tell me all the time that they want to spend more time with their kids. The fact that some women want to work part time so dad can be home with the kids on the weekend certainly is not a reason to exploit them. It is certainly not a reason to pay them less or take away their pay and conditions. It reflects a very old fashioned view that women are not supporting a family when they work; they are working for pin money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last week we saw the gratuitous insults about women in our defence forces. We heard opposition members say that women on the front line would threaten rational thought and the success of the mission and that the psychological standards of the forces would be compromised by the admission of women. Well, news flash: women are already soldiers, sailors, pilots and medics. They are already on the front line.
           </p>
           <p>
            We see an emerging trend here—an emerging trend of an opposition stuck in the past and out of touch with the reality of modern Australian lives. And nowhere is this more evident than on the website of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Liberal Party of Australia
            </a>
            . I had a look at the website of the Liberal Party of Australia and it has a section about the Liberal Party. In the section about the Liberal Party it has a subheading ‘Women and the Liberal Party’. It is good. It is very interesting and very informative. I looked at the picture in the ‘Women and the Liberal Party’ section and found that it has one, two—

                  The photograph has four blokes and one woman. But it actually gets even better. It says that the ‘government recognises that the ability of women to participate in the workforce, and in society more broadly, is underpinned by education and training’. It goes on to say that the ‘government is committed to an Australia where women are full and active participants’, and ‘the government has introduced a number of measures to allow women to better prepare for their retirement’. Oops! It has been almost two years now—

                   On a point of order, Mr Speaker: at four minutes and thirty seconds, I would invite you to ask the minister to draw her answer to a conclusion.
