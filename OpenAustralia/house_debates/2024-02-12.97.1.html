        My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness. How will the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts help tradies building the new homes Australia needs? What has been the response to Labor's plan for tradies to keep more of what they earn?

          I thank the member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
           McEwen
          </a>
          for that question. I know the member for McEwen has been a big supporter of our ambitious housing agenda in his own electorate and, indeed, around the country. That's why, of course, every tradie paying tax in Australia will get a tax cut from 1 July under Labor's plan. Every taxpaying tradie will get a tax cut and, for many, they will get a bigger tax cut thanks to the Labor government. Labourers on an average taxable income of $57,000 will get a tax cut of $1,349, over $700 more than under the previous plan.
         </p>
         <p>
          But it is not just labourers; eighty-eight per cent will get a bigger tax cut under our plan. Sparkies, on average, with their average taxable income of $110,000 will get a tax cut of $2,262, over $750 more than the previous plan. Indeed, 84 per cent of electricians across the country will get a bigger tax cut because of Labor's plan. Carpenters, critical to the building industry, on average taxable incomes of $72,000 will get a tax cut $1,563 on average, over $730 more than under the previous plan. Indeed, 94 per cent of carpenters in this country will get a bigger tax cut under Labor's plan. A plumber on an average taxable income of $79,000 will get a tax cut of $1,730, over $750 more than under the previous plan and 94 per cent of plumbers in Australia who pay tax will get a bigger tax cut under our plan—so 94 per cent of plumbers better off, 94 per cent of carpenters better off, 84 per cent of electricians better off, and 88 per cent of labourers better off.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a tax cut for every working Australian, all 13.6 million of them and for the 76,000 of them in the member for McEwen's electorate. But that's what responsible government is about. It's about listening to the people, making the tough but right decisions to help people with the cost of living, and it is in stark contrast to what those opposite are doing. Indeed, they are all over the place when it comes to tax cuts. They said they were going to fight them in this place. They said they were going to roll them back and, indeed, on the same day they support the very tax cuts.

             You are correct on the first point, but this question contained what has been a response, so the minister—I was listening carefully—was reading a direct quote about the changes that have been presented before the House, so I will not uphold the point of order.

              For tax cuts that they support, those opposite appear very angry over there. They either support them or they don't. But let's be honest, these tradies with their tax cuts are critical to building the houses that Australia needs. We know that the tradies are critical to this. We want them to earn more and we want them to keep more of what they earn so they can get on and build the homes that Australia needs.
