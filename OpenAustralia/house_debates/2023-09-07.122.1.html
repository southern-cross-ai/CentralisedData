        Today I proudly stand to celebrate the achievements and progress of clubs within my Pearce electorate. The support provided by the government through the Stronger Communities Program has proven instrumental in helping these clubs realise their goals, fostering inclusivity and strengthening our local community bonds. The Stronger Communities Program provides between $2,500 and $20,000 for not-for-profit community organisations and local governments to deliver small capital projects that deliver social benefits and boost local community participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Wanneroo Giants Baseball Club is located at the Kingsway Regional Sporting Complex. This fantastic club has displayed its commitment to inclusivity through its challenger program, which provides a platform for children with diverse abilities to participate in the joy of baseball. Recognising the challenges faced by children with mobility difficulties, the club has embarked on a mission to improve their accessibility. Their request for assistance will enable the creation of additional gate access points, allowing these young athletes to get onto the field with ease. This will not only foster direct engagement with the game but also facilitate interaction with their buddies, who provide unwavering support. These changes will uplift the experience for the players, the umpires and the ground crews and will also lay the foundations for increased community participation, empowering more wheelchair-bound children to participate in sports.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also recognise the wonderful Ridgewood Little Athletics Centre, which has five member clubs: the Butler Boomers, the Clarkson Cougars, the Mindarie Mustangs, the Quinns Rocks Sharks and the Yanchep Dolphins. A story of growth and aspiration, this club recognised the importance of upgrading its facilities, to upgrade its timing gates, computers for track events and advanced high jump mats to ensure the safety of its members. The club's dedication to safety and the development of our youth stands as a testament to their commitment to creating a stronger community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, I applaud the welcoming and inclusive Yanchep Sports Club, which has undergone a transformation in response to changing demographics. With the influx of young families into the region, the need for a safe and enjoyable space for children became apparent. The club embarked on a mission to not only accommodate the changing needs of the community but also encourage family engagement. The creation of a safe, enclosed area for youngsters to gather, play and learn fosters a strong sense of community and belonging. This integration enriches the club's offerings, strengthening connections and relationships within the community. It is heartening to witness these clubs leverage the support provided by the government to create lasting positive change while sowing the seeds of a stronger, more united society.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I wish to recognise the remarkable dedication of club executives, committees, coaches and all who have worked hard to bring these visions to life.
