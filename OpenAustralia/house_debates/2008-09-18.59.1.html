           </small>
           <p>
            I thank the member for Makin for his question. I know he has a particularly strong focus on the interests of his local community, as a former mayor. In fact, I have visited various projects which the honourable member has had running in his former municipality on local water conservation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Climate change is a challenge for us all. It is a challenge for the future. It is a challenge which requires the nation to act nationally and internationally. That is why this government’s approach to climate change rests on three core pillars. Firstly, how do you reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Secondly, how do you shape a global solution which means being part of the Kyoto process, not pretending that it does not exist? Thirdly, how do you also adapt to climate change, which is of such a critical concern to so many out there in rural and regional Australia as well?
           </p>
           <p>
            Our response to this—on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions—is what are the practical ways forward? The Treasurer has spoken to one in the parliament already today: a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
             Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
            </a>
            . This is a very significant reform both for the environment and for the economy. It will be tough. It will be hard. It will require difficult decisions, but this government is determined to take those difficult decisions. The second way forward is: how do we go about boosting energy efficiency in our country? The government is developing an energy efficiency strategy to that effect. The third way forward is: how do we also boost the renewable energy role within the overall national electricity grid? Once again, the government is developing a strategy on that as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the period ahead, however, we have got this huge challenge with coal-fired power stations. What are we going to do about emissions now from coal-fired power stations and into the period ahead? We have more than a passing interest in this—not just in terms of our domestic reliance on coal-fired electricity generation but, beyond that, in the critical role of coal exports for this country. We are the largest coal-exporting country in the world. We, therefore, have a particular responsibility given our national energy requirements, as well as our national export requirements, to deal with this challenge of ensuring that coal-fired stations in the future are as clean as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            That brings us to the question of clean coal technology and carbon sequestration. How do we deal with this effectively? Earlier today I spoke on legislation which has been introduced by the Minister for Resources and Energy concerning the regulatory regime for offshore sequestration sites for Australia. This is a world first. This is something which those opposite fiddled around with, but they never actually got their act together to bring the legislation through.

             They did not. They had a lot of time to act on this but failed. Legislation has been put forward by us. It has been introduced into the parliament, and I commend the actions of the minister for energy in what he has done on this in making sure we have got something which works for industry but, critically, works for the national economy as well.

              I would say this to those opposite, as they howl in interjection: we have an opportunity for Australia to be the world leader in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCS" rel="nofollow">
               CCS
              </a>
              technologies. The question is whether the government is going to get behind industry on this or push industry to one side. This government intends to get right behind industry and work with them, because we believe it is absolutely critical for CCS to work. The G8 recently in Hokkaido came up with a proposal to have 20 demonstration projects, up to 250 megawatts each, in operation by 2020, capable of demonstrating that this technology works. The practical question for all of us is: how is that going to happen?

               Those opposite find this enormously amusing. As Australia is the world’s largest coal exporter—I really find it interesting that those opposite find this so amusing—we are interested in protecting Australia’s long-term coal industry. We are interested in protecting Australia’s long-term coal exports. We are aimed at doing this both for our own economic interests and to make sure that we are doing the right thing by the global environment.

                  technologies are so critical. Our government’s ambition is to become the world leader in this technology and its application. We will have more to say about this in the days ahead. I suggest to those opposite that, rather than carping and being critical about it, they should get on with the process of supporting the government’s actions.

                 <p>
                  The other part of the honourable member’s question goes to the impact of climate change on water. Here again we are confronted with a dilemma in terms of the posture of those opposite. We know that the Murray-Darling is suffering from enormous stress. That stress, contrary to what the previous Leader of the Opposition said, is partly the product of climate change. It is also the product of historical overallocation of water entitlements. Our challenge is: what are we going to do about it? Therefore, what we have done since coming into government—and I say ‘done’ since coming into government; we have not dreamt about it like those opposite did for so long—is begin to buy back water entitlements.

                          , we have taken a decision to buy back the water entitlements associated with the purchase of that station—20 billion litres of water to the Darling, peaking up to 80 billion litres in flood times. What do we have from the shadow minister for water security on behalf of the National Party? His statement is that this is an ‘anti-rural Australia act’. So the view of the coalition—because he is the shadow minister for the coalition—is that they are opposed to our buying back 20 billion litres worth of water entitlements to the Darling and up to 80 billion litres in flood time.

My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is this: do you back the shadow minister for water or do you back the member for Sturt? Where does the Liberal Party stand on buying back water entitlements? In nine short months, we have acted on this. We have purchased 37 gigalitres. We have now purchased a station which possesses a potential to buy back another 20 and up to 80. Where does the—
