        It is disappointing to hear that citrus canker has again been detected in Australia. This has happened seven times over the last hundred years. Within Flynn are several large citrus farms: 2PH Farms in Emerald, and Golden Mile Orchards at Mundubbera and Ironbark Citrus at Mundubbera, just to mention a few. In 2004 we saw the wholesale destruction of the Emerald and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        citrus industry, a 50-kilometre exclusion zone and the eradication of every tree in the town and the surrounding properties. If you had a lemon tree in your backyard, that went too. I met with Craig Pressler of 2PH Farms on Friday. He is very concerned about the rise of citrus canker. In 2004 the Pressler operation was crippled by citrus canker. To eradicate the canker some 500,000 trees had to be destroyed at their Emerald orchard. This was done to curtail the incursion. Vigilance and swift action is the key. It is paramount that strict quarantine is followed. We now have canker in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        and some parts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        . I urge the authorities to take the same action as they did in Emerald in 2004. The same action is now required in the Northern Territory and WA, otherwise the risks are very high and could see the end of the citrus industry in Australia.

        While at Emerald I attended the Western Queensland Local Government Association conference. It was attended by 150 delegates, as well as a minister and senators. The 12 shires that attended included Barcaldine, Blackall, Isaac and Longreach, just to name a few. Well done and congratulations to the committee chair, Mr Kerry Hayes, mayor of

        , and his team. It was an excellent conference.
