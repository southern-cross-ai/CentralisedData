         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I accept that the question is in order but I am confident that the answer will not be. Mr Speaker, I would seek your assistance in terms of maintaining the order of the House in holding the minister strictly to matters—

           I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. The member for Lindsay knows how important integrity in written material is because he was the victim of a fake pamphlet prior to the last election. In the modern age, the integrity of emails is just as important. That is why the Rudd government has marked National E-security
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness_Week" rel="nofollow">
            Awareness Week

           . It began, very interestingly, just two weeks ago—two weeks ago, the day after the first question, based upon a fake email, was raised by those opposite, it was National E-Security Awareness Week.

                    Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under 100(d) of the rules, imputations are not permitted. I have to say that I found the minister’s imputation highly offensive, as did many other people on this side of the House. I would ask that you ask him to withdraw.

                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness_Week" rel="nofollow">
                       Awareness Week
                      </a>
                      has some key lessons. As part of the material, its lessons for all computer users include:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      When dealing with email it is important to not just blindly follow attachments from unknown sources.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That was part of the lessons that were out there in the National E-security Awareness Week promotional material for the general public. It also said:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      It is important to take a bit of care in trusting where the information came from.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That is what the National E-security Awareness Week material said, just two weeks ago. Indeed, we launched an education module aimed at year 3 and year 9 students. There is no doubt that in the future it can be played in some of the new classrooms that we are building. We also produced a series of postcards. I commend to members of the House the website: www.staysmartonline.gov.au. The postcards say:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      What have you lost?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Maybe the leadership! They also say:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      Protect yourself online.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We even have the program ‘Budd:e’. I table it for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, who may need one or two in coming days. Clearly, the opposition did not pay attention during National E-security Awareness Week, because what we have seen from the opposition is their reliance upon a fake email to call for the resignation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The sorts of lessons that are being taught to kids in year 3 have not been learnt by those opposite, who are the alternative government of the nation.

                      The contradictions, when it comes to the connections with Mr Grech and this email, are quite extraordinary. At 7.55 am today, the shadow Treasurer, when asked about the correspondence with Mr Grech over the last few months, said, ‘Not to my knowledge.’ At 8.05 am the Leader of the Opposition was asked on
                      <i>
                       AM
                      </i>
                      :
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      Has anyone in the Opposition, to your knowledge, spoken to Mr Grech in the last few months apart from that conversation

                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The answer was:

                     <p class="italic">
                      Well, I’m sure they have. I mean Mr Grech is very well known and I have certainly spoken to Mr Grech.

Another lesson is that you cannot delete them from your computers. There are other lessons there as well. The members of the opposition might bear that in mind and cooperate with the
