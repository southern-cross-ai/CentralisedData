       <p>
        Last week I attended the Underdale High School's governing council meeting and want to congratulate the principal, Nigel Gill, teachers and parents for some of the good work they are doing at Underdale High. It was especially good to hear two of the senior students, members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC" rel="nofollow">
         SRC
        </a>
        , who reported on some of the social initiatives the students were doing, particularly in the area of social justice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another unique program at Underdale is the soccer academy which, for the past 11 years, has used the beautiful game as a tool to attract students and train a new generation of soccer administrators and players. The academy teachers students on-field as well as off-field aspects of soccer, from nutrition and fitness to the high-level technical and physiological attributes needed to make it in the world game. The academy's director, Rod del Nido, said the academy was established as a bit of a behavioural management tool where kids who were misbehaving but had a passion for football started this program and became more engaged in their education. He said the daily attendance of above 90 per cent has translated into other subjects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great initiative is a program run by the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , promoting social justice through football, through the Football United program in South Australia. At this time of the World Cup—and I say go the Socceroos against the Dutch!—it is great to see some soccer programs out there in our community.
