       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated sharply.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the global financial crisis, the global economy is now facing a much deeper and more protracted recession than previously expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Advanced economies are expected to experience the sharpest collective decline in gross domestic product in the postwar period.
       </p>
       <p>
        The key emerging economies of China and India are now forecast to slow markedly, with growth in China expected to halve in just two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        And as a result, the global commodity boom, which has provided significant stimulus to Australian growth and incomes over recent years, is winding back.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the weight of the global recession now bearing down on the Australian economy, growth is expected to be weaker than anticipated and unemployment will be higher.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also impact directly on the budget bottom line.
       </p>
       <p>
        The global recession has wiped out $115 billion of tax receipts across the forward estimates and moved the budget into temporary deficit.
       </p>
       <p>
        To support jobs and growth in the face of the global recession, the Rudd government has announced the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will temporarily add to the deficit.
       </p>
       <p>
        This
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4041" rel="nofollow">
         bill
        </a>
        will ensure that the government can raise the funds required to meet this temporary deficit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 provides the Treasurer with a standing authority to borrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        This standing authority to borrow is limited to $75 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment proposes to supplement that limit by providing that, in special circumstances, the Treasurer may increase the cap by $125 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current global recession, and its impact on Australia, is clearly such a special circumstance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overwhelming majority of the increase in net debt is due to the collapse in tax receipts as a result of the global recession and the unwinding of the commodities boom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rises in payments, also associated with the slowing economy, are contributing to net debt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government’s measures to support jobs and growth will also contribute.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian government net debt will remain very low by international standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the end of the forward estimates Australia’s net debt is forecast to be just 5.2 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        , while the average net debt for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        countries in 2010 is estimated to be around 45 per cent of GDP.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government remains committed to its medium-term fiscal strategy of achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the cycle.
       </p>
       <p>
        As soon as the economy recovers and grows above trend, the government will take action to return the budget to surplus.
       </p>
       <p>
        These surpluses will be drawn upon to retire debt as rapidly as economic circumstances permit.
       </p>
       <p>
        But now, in the face of a deep and protracted global recession, the government must be focused on supporting jobs and growth, while investing in nation-building infrastructure—and we make no apology for that. I commend the bill to the House.
