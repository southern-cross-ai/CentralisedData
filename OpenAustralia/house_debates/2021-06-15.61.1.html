        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Will you commit to broadening the definition of immediate family for travel exemptions to include parents and also prospective marriage visa holders? If this definition remains unchanged and the government does not provide a clear road map, we face the risk of a skills drain. I presented a petition to the House today. Some of the signatories are in the House, and they're awaiting your response. They're desperate for their parents' help, and they need some answers.

         I thank the member for her question. I take on board the very serious issue that she has raised, and there are a couple of parts to it. The first part clearly deals with the definition and whether or not that should be widened. Allow me to come back to that in my answer. The second deals with skills shortages here in Australia. This government takes very seriously both of those issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the skills shortages issue, I understand that the minister responsible is looking very closely at what we can do to address a significant skills shortage in a number of areas here in Australia, and I am very much prepared to work with the minister to make sure that we can do all that we can to ensure that Australia has the skilled workforce that it needs not only now but for the months and the years ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the question that you asked in relation to broadening the scope and the definition, all I'm able to say at this point in time is that there are a number of investigations that are taking place at this point in time. I would be more than happy to meet with you directly to pursue this further. Thank you very much for your question.
