        Sadly, last week, on 27 July, a man lost his life on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appin_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Appin Road
        </a>
        in my electorate of Macarthur. We've been talking about Appin Road really since 2015, when approval was mooted for a Lendlease development on one side of that road. There was increasing traffic from the port of Wollongong coming along Appin Road, through my electorate of Macarthur, through Campbelltown and into Sydney. There had been a number of deaths on the road.

        Shamefully, nothing has changed. In the last two decades, 25 people have lost their lives on that road. It's a very dangerous two-lane road—one lane each way—surrounded by heavily wooded areas with large trees. If you make a mistake on Appin Road, there is no way out, and it is very likely you will lose your life. Liberal-National governments have done nothing about that in spite of entreaties over years. We have been talking and talking. We can't even get the ministers for the

        state government out to look at the road. We need koala protections on that road, but most of all we need attention to that road so lives can be saved. I have called for a summit of federal, state and local government members to try and finally get some action on the very dangerous Appin Road. We all should be ashamed of what's happening.
