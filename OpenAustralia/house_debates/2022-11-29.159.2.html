       <p>
        Last week we observed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an international campaign against what is, sadly, the most pervasive human rights violation worldwide. This is a topic that's important to my community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        and to me personally as a woman, a mother, a sister, a friend and a proud citizen of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is often recognised as an international leader in women's rights. In 1902 we became one of the first countries in the world to grant women the right to vote. In 1924 we elected our first woman to parliament: the iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cowan" rel="nofollow">
         Edith Cowan
        </a>
        . In the 1970s, under Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, we passed a series of legislative reforms to improve women's access to contraception, equal pay, early childhood education and divorce which, ultimately, laid the groundwork for the fairer society we see today. We have fought to promote and defend women's rights on our own shores, as well as advocated for women's rights overseas, through our foreign aid programs, peacekeeping contributions and engagements with bodies like the United Nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite our ambitions and some progress towards equality, the reality is that we still have a long way to go. Statistics show that gender based violence in Australia is widespread. Fifty-three per cent of women have experienced sexual harassment. Take a moment to look around this room or to think about the women that you know. That means that over half of us have been made to feel unsafe or humiliated by unwanted sexual advances and behaviours. This reality is staggering. Disturbingly, the normalcy of this type of behaviour has often made it more difficult than necessary not only for it to be called out but even, at times, for it to be recognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        From my own personal experience, I know the feelings of self-doubt and shame that come when you're faced with harassment or abuse. The immediate question that is all too easily asked is: 'What did I do to deserve this?' And the damage in this mindset or this frame of mind is that it often melts across generations. So it is that mothers pass it on to daughters and mothers pass it on to daughters—thus, abuse has intergenerational consequences. This is compounded by the capacity of people to now harass and bully with impunity via social channels—something that has become far too frequent an occurrence since I took on this role. We know that not all disrespect to women results in violence, but all violence against women—indeed, all violence—starts with disrespect. As a public figure, I've now been subject to gender based bullying and harassment online, as I suspect many of my colleagues have. I believe we'd all be subjected to a similar daily barrage of abuse from cowards hiding behind their keyboards. But even knowing this as I took on this role, some of the messages that I've received during this time have been truly breathtaking, with one of the more recent—and I'll apologise in advance for offence—saying, 'You fucking ugly big nosed slut. And you're a fat cunt. Climate change is bullshit.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Public awareness of sexual violence has grown in recent years, thanks in part to brave women like Grace Tame, Brittany Higgins and Chanel Contos, who have opened up about their experiences and inspired others to do the same. In the words of the indomitable Grace Tame:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When we share, we heal, reconnect, and grow, both as individuals and as a united, strengthened collective. History, lived experience, the whole truth, unsanitised, and unedited, is our greatest learning resource. It is what informs social and structural change.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was Brittany Higgins's courage that resulted in the Jenkins review, whose recommendations are now playing out in the Anti-Discrimination and Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Respect at Work) Bill 2022 that passed the Senate last week.
       </p>
       <p>
        A survey conducted as part of that review found that one in three people working in this building had personally experienced sexual harassment at work and that over half of us had experienced at least one incident of bullying, harassment or assault. Those numbers are absolutely unacceptable, particularly when you consider the example we are setting in this house for workplaces around the country. As the highest office holders in the land, federal politicians must be held to the highest standards. We in this chamber must take the lead in putting an end to gender based violence in Australia with our words, thoughts and deeds by working with specialist organisations, states and territories to support and protect vulnerable women; strengthening our justice system, responses and services; and identifying and addressing problematic cultural norms that still stand in the way of true equality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The war against gender based violence has many fronts, and I'm proud to represent a passionate and compassionate electorate that is contributing significantly to positive change. In 2016, a group of North Sydney residents came together to open Mary's House, a dedicated women's shelter for victims of domestic violence. As the shelter puts it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mary's House is symbolic of the community's commitment to say no to domestic violence, to reduce risk of harm from domestic violence and save lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most recently, I met with the organisers of a new grassroots effort to teach hairdressers how to recognise signs of domestic violence and help victims get the support they need. As many of us know, hairdressers not only cut hair but sometimes also fill the role of de facto therapist and confidant for women visiting the salon. This makes hairdressers uniquely well placed to help educate the community about gender based violence and support potential victims of abuse. It's a brilliant idea. The Northside Baptist Church and Crows Nest Centre, who are spearheading this effort, deserve all our thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spent much of my career working with advocacy groups towards a better, fairer, kinder society for all. I've seen the tremendous impact community led initiatives like Mary's House, the Delvena Refuge, Northside's hairdressers education campaign and others like them can make to individuals in our society. Truly, people can do amazing things when we are united behind a common purpose. Today, as we observe the United Nations 16-day campaign, we in North Sydney call on our fellow Australians to unite against gender based violence. Violence against women is a scourge on our civilised society. It's time to push forward to end violence against women and girls, here and everywhere.

        <p>
         Before I begin my speech, I'd like to acknowledge all of my sister survivors-victims out there who are living with or recovering from family and domestic violence, and I want to take time to also pay my respects to all the women and children that we have lost—far too many. A home is supposed to represent a place of warmth, comfort, affection and security, but we know that for many people in Australia their home is a place of violence, a place of cruelty and a place of abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last Friday was the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         for the Elimination of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_Women" rel="nofollow">
          Violence against Women
         </a>
         and it marked the beginning of the 16 days of activism against gender based violence and Western Australia's 16 days in WA campaign to stop violence against women. I've been incredibly honoured, over the years, as many women from across Australia have confided in me. They have opened up to me and shared their most vulnerable selves with me, discussing their experiences of being a survivor, their experiences of supporting a relative as that relative flees a violent situation or their experiences assisting a survivor as they reassemble the fragments of their life. In every story, I can feel the pain and I can feel the sorrow all too keenly. But I also know that there are many, many, many more stories out there—untold stories belonging to those who are still in danger and who may never make it to safety. For too long, domestic violence has been a taboo topic in our society, but we can no longer deny that it is part of everyday life for millions of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Too often here in this country, we've looked at other societies and we have had a habit of using the status of women as a yardstick of progress—measuring ourselves against those women in Iran or in other societies where perhaps they don't have as many freedoms or as much equality as we have here. But we need to stop doing this because the fact is that domestic violence in Australia is alarmingly common. Given that we are saying goodbye to an average of one woman every 10 days, it's time to stop and think about just what it is within our own society that is perpetuating these high rates of domestic violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns only intensified violence, with an increased severity or frequency of violence, because survivors and perpetrators spent more time together and because of the pressures of economic hardship. But I also want to discuss the enormously harmful impacts of domestic violence on all members of the household. It is not the case that children are simply exposed to domestic violence when they reside with families. Rather, they are survivors in their own right. There is rarely a situation in which children and teenagers are exposed to domestic violence without also being substantially affected by this violence. There is enough research out there about the impact of domestic violence on the development of children and young people. Yet children are often treated only as witnesses but not victims of domestic violence in and of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need a trauma informed approach to healing for both the mother and the children who are escaping family and domestic violence. Indeed, homelessness is one of the most visible effects of domestic violence on young people. A recent report by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Mission Australia
         </a>
         estimates that around 80 per cent of homelessness among young people is due to domestic violence. Domestic violence, when it occurs between intimate partners carries more victims than just those who are involved. We need to recognise that children in domestic violence situations and young people in domestic violence situations are also victims and are also living with domestic violence. When I think about the 16 days of activism against gender based violence, I think that it's apt that we start talking about these things and that we start talking about the impact on children.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps, controversially I'm also going to say this: I think we should stop talking about domestic violence as being about respect because I can tell you now that my ex-husband—my first husband—respected the women that he worked for. He was perfectly capable of showing respect to the women that served him in the shops and the women that he worked with, and the women that he encountered in his everyday life. It's not about respect; it's about power. It's about time we start calling out domestic violence and the origins of domestic violence and why it occurs and speak about it in those terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         For all of those women out there who are living with the impacts of domestic violence: I hear you, I see you, I know you. I know what it's like to live with that trauma. I know that you carry it around with you no matter how far you've gone and no matter how far you've come in your life. I often describe it as a tiny little broken bone, a crack somewhere in your body, that you carry with you. You don't always feel it, but you always know it's there. That's the impact of the trauma of family and domestic violence, and it's a lifelong trauma. I've had women in their seventies come and talk to me about the violence they suffered 30 or 40 years ago. I've had women teenagers and women in their twenties come and talk to me about the violence they are suffering now.
        </p>
        <p>
         In closing, I'll say that I'm proud to be part of a government that takes domestic violence seriously. I'm proud to be part of a government that has a vision to eradicate violence against women and children in a generation. I'm proud to be part of a government that has recognised intersectionality in our plan to eradicate violence against women in that generation. The fact is, and the statistics are, that women of colour are less likely to be believed when they report violence and are more likely to be victims. I want to put out a message that, if anyone out there listening needs help or support or if they know anyone who does, there are services available, so please reach out. Reach out to 1800RESPECT, Kids Helpline, Crisis Care, the Women's Domestic Violence Helpline and many more. Violence against women needs to stop, and we all have a part to play, every single one of us, men, women and children. But it won't stop if we don't talk about it. So let's use these 16 days of activism to talk about it.

             It is a privilege to speak on this motion today, but I think we would all prefer to live in a world where such motions weren't necessary, a world where violence against women wasn't such a widespread danger. But we don't live in that world, and we won't live in that world until we change our culture.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a global problem, but violence against women is tragically common in Australia. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
              Bureau of Statistics
             </a>
             has found that one in three Australian women, 15 years or older, has experienced physical violence—one in three—and one in five Australian women have experienced sexual violence. We've all heard stories from our friends and our families. We know how prevalent it is. We know that the majority of this violence is the product of men who are known to the victim. I represent the community of Wentworth in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. We are a relatively wealthy electorate, and many people wonder if this is a problem in our community. It is a problem in our community. I have spoken to the commander of the police in our community, who says that 50 per cent of police time in our area is spent on domestic violence. It is everywhere, in every part of this country.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also want to acknowledge the work that some incredible people have done, particularly activists like Grace Tame and Chanel Contos, who is also from my electorate. They have done so much to share their stories and shine a light on a shameful part of our culture and how prevalent these issues are in our community, particularly among younger women. Like so many people in Wentworth, I have read their stories and the stories of others they have shared, and it has broken my heart. It is simply overwhelming, but I deeply admire what they have achieved. They have put a spotlight on something we have ignored for far too long, and they've driven real change. Grace Tame bravely led the way in changing the laws in Tasmania so that survivors could speak out. Chanel Contos led the way in changing the laws in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             to require affirmative consent and to embed consent education in schools. Both are continuing to drive vital changes in our laws. But it's not just changes in our laws we need. We need changes in our culture, our attitudes, our behaviours, our values and the power-imbalance between men and women in this country.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can start with the little things such as the language in our classrooms, our locker rooms and especially in our parliament. It's small but it matters. It matters because small things lead to big things. Children learn from what they see and hear. If they see disrespectful attitudes, they will think that's what is acceptable and that is how they will behave. We also need to improve the education of our children so they understand respect and consent from an early age. We teach young girls to support each other, to be careful and to defend themselves because they have no choice, but let's make sure we're teaching the young boys the attitudes and behaviours that will make them responsible members of the community. With strong, positive role models, I believe this is possible. Everyone should see themselves as role models for young people in their lives. Men who are caregivers, teachers, coaches and others in similar roles have a special responsibility to teach boys how to handle their emotions in a mature, constructive way. This won't solve violence against women today, but it is a really important step.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also absolutely critical that we acknowledge the impact of the economic imbalance between men and women and the impact that that has in terms of violence against women. We must empower women economically because that is about empowering women in terms of power, and that makes a difference in terms of violence against women. I acknowledge the government for their work on increasing parental leave and I strongly advocate that we make sure that this ensures that men take up a significant care role within their families because it is absolutely critical for men to play that role, but also for women to be, and continue to be, economically empowered. It is absolutely critical.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is so much more that we need to do. The work of Grace Tame, Chanel Contos and many others show us that change is possible and change can be achieved. So much has changed in the last five years because of strong female leadership from across the community, particularly women of all ages who are standing up, and wonderful services like the Bondi Beach Cottage which provides the grassroots services that are so critical for those in need. I'm sure much more will change in the next five years. It has to.

             </p>
             <p>
              The Albanese government and, I know, all members of this House—this entire parliament—are absolutely committed to women's safety. The fact is that women's safety is a national priority. This is a commitment I know we all share. We're all committed to ending violence against women and children in one generation. We know that every 10 days one woman dies at the hands of a current or former partner. We know that each week police across the country deal with 5,000 incidents of domestic violence. This is something that I know as a former frontline police officer, having attended hundreds of domestic violence incidents and seen firsthand the tragedy and horror that it brings. Ending violence against women and children is everybody's responsibility and it is, indeed, everybody's business.
             </p>
             <p>
              Last Friday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the commencement of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. These 16 days really are a time for the world to unite and raise awareness, and call for the prevention and elimination of gender based violence. We must all be speaking out. This parliament, our community, family, friends—everyone that we know must be talking about this issue. As the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of

             </p>
             <p>
              It is very important for anyone listening or reading this later on that, if you or someone you know is impacted by domestic, family or sexual violence, you can call 1800RESPECT, which is 1800737732, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Of course, if it's a life-threatening situation, call triple 0. Reach out. Get some support.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said, for our government, women's safety is an absolute national priority. Recently, we launched the National Plan to End Violence against
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
               Women and Children
              </a>
              . The 10-year plan outlines our shared vision to end gender based violence within one generation. The plan is a strong commitment to 10 years of sustained action, effort and partnership across governments and the sector, working towards eliminating all forms of gender based violence. And, of course, we work very closely with all of the states and territories as well. Everyone is on the same page.
             </p>
             <p>
              This plan, this 10-year plan, is underpinned by four very important pillars: prevention, early intervention, response, and recovery and healing. What that means in practice is that we need to stop the violence before it starts. We need to work with those people most at risk of experiencing violence and also with those who may be prone to using violence. We must provide support, most importantly, for the victims-survivors in the short term and the long term. The national plan recognises that trauma informed and person centred approaches are needed to address a lot of the barriers to recovery and healing and to minimise the possibility that victims-survivors will be retraumatised and harmed when using services and systems. They need to be getting the correct support when they need it. The national plan also provides clear indicators to track our success to support and help in reducing the prevalence of violence.
             </p>
             <p>
              To support the implementation of the plan, we have made the vitally important step of appointing the very first Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner, Micaela Cronin, who has an extensive history in the community sector and is very widely respected. Micaela Cronin has just started in that role, and the commission that she will lead will provide a formal mechanism for consultation with victims-survivors and will work to create a supportive and structured approach to engagement at a national level. It's these voices, the victims-survivors' voices, that will help to inform priority for policy, research and data collection. The fact is victims-survivors have to be at the absolute heart of the solutions. We know that effective solutions can only be achieved and developed with the people that are most impacted by them.
             </p>
             <p>
              The commissioner will also promote coordination across state and territory jurisdictions and the sector more broadly to highlight service gaps and areas of greatest need and to enable a system that works together to provide that holistic support. This, really importantly, includes the development of consistent definitions for improved reporting, data collection and evaluation frameworks. Through all of this, the commissioner will be able to monitor and measure the progress of the national plan.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, as well, the Albanese government's recent budget committed $1.7 billion in funding for initiatives to support the implementation of the national plan. Really importantly, we're delivering on our election commitment of just over $169 million over four years for 500 new frontline community-sector workers. These workers will provide support to those experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence right across the country. These new workers will particularly meet service gaps, especially in our rural and regional areas. We know how important it is. Often people in regional areas are very isolated, so we want to make sure that support is there for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              This $1.7 billion package also works to address the structural issues that contribute to violence against women. Some of the things we need to address include housing, women's economic security, access to child care, paid family and domestic violence leave and, of course, respectful relationships and consent education in schools. All of these are vitally important. In addition to our 500-worker commitment, as I said, that we made during the election and are now delivering on, the women's safety budget package gives $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options, because we need to have more options for women and children who are experiencing domestic violence and also for older women who are at risk of homelessness. We need to have that crisis accommodation in place.
             </p>
             <p>
              We also have additional funding for the escaping violence payment program. As part of that package, some of the key priorities that we are addressing include a commitment to an investment in consent and respectful relationships education. We need to have that in our schools so at a young age people become aware about this issue and about the need for respectful relationships. We have our commitment of over $42 million to address sexual harassment at work by implementing the recommendations of the Respect@Work report and a commitment to support the implementation of our landmark paid family and domestic violence leave, which is so important. This 10 days will ensure that no individual should have to choose between having a job and leaving an abusive relationship. We're very proud to be delivering on that as part of our absolute commitment to women's safety.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I and many speakers have said, ending violence against women and children is everybody's responsibility and it is indeed everybody's business. In line with the theme of the 16 days of activism, I implore everyone to keep talking about these issues, to keep raising them. For those who we know are victims, encourage them to get support. We have to all work together to this end. We do.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have this strong commitment to eliminate violence against women and children in one generation. I know that everyone, as I say, from all sides of this parliament shares that commitment to working towards that goal. We have to achieve it when we look at those statistics, when we look at one woman dying every 10 days at the hands of a current or former partner. When we look at police attending the 5,000 incidents per week, we have to have this change. We have all put of these measures in place since we have been elected. This is a national priority for the Albanese Labor government, and I know that our commitment is shared by everyone throughout this House.

                Social Services
               </a>
               and the shadow minister for child protection and prevention of family violence. Thank you for your continued commitment and for the heartfelt statements that have been made by each of you in this place to date. Hearing the similar goals of policies and planning benchmarks provided by each as we work towards eradicating this scourge from Australian society concisely reaffirms the bipartisan approach that is already in place and must continue to drive meaningful change.
              </p>
              <p>
               We, as a collective government, must be decisive, evaluative, reflective and realistic in our goals, and appreciate that truly moving forward requires generational change. As we plan the next year, three years, 10 years, we must judge each step against a longer term commitment: I appreciate that the current government has the same noble intentions as the one that preceded it and a strong desire to move the dial further. A simple fact that I know that we all appreciate is we cannot buy our way out of this endemic. Every dollar we spend in aid of this cause needs to drive societal change and a systematic evolution of how we, as a community, deal not just with violence against women but with all family and domestic violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since accepting the role of shadow of assistant minister for the prevention of family violence, I have met with dozens of organisations not only from within my electorate but also broadly across Australia who currently provide services and support for victims of family and domestic violence and, in some cases, for perpetrators. I have listened to and consulted with these organisations who span the pillars of the recent plan, from prevention to early intervention, response and recovery. While I have significant firsthand experience from my years as a police officer and then a prosecutor, there are many challenges and nuances faced by each organisation at each stage of the family violence journey that I now better appreciate. One particularly vivid analogy that I was presented with earlier on and which subsequently resonated with many of these providers was the feeling of being the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an example, the

                New South Wales
               </a>
               police have attended over 140,000 domestic violence incidents each year for the past three years. This equates to one call to the police every four minutes in my home state. In one particular township within my electorate, I've heard from the providers that domestic violence response contributes up to 50 per cent of their workload. In regional and rural areas as a whole, incidents of domestic violence and subsequent court orders are significantly higher per capita than in their metro counterparts,. To illustrate this, in 2021 there were over 2,300 domestic violence orders granted in the

               areas, a rate more than double that of

                Greater Sydney
               </a>
               . When looking at statistics such as these, I'm saddened and equally disgusted. I am also determined to ensure that, as parliamentarians, we are paying enough attention to prevention and early intervention.
              </p>
              <p>
               I absolutely recognise the very real and immediate need to provide response and recovery services and to invest in appropriate housing and support measures for those already in the cycle. I personally worked with local and state governments in my first term to provide a great example of this in Kempsey, where the old ambulance station that was no longer in use is now being repurposed into 26 apartments to be used for crisis accommodation along with 24-hour on-site support and youth facilities. It's overdue and critical infrastructure that I am extremely proud to have played a part in. But I recognise that a lot of funding is back-end loaded and, without adequate resourcing and effective programs for prevention and early intervention, we will perpetually be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, spending infinite time and resources on response rather than providing a pathway or guide rails for respectful relationships and attitudes towards women.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have said before, and continue to say, that I am committed to working with any individual, organisation or party who dedicates themselves to ending violence against women, children and families. We owe it to our communities and we owe it to our future generations. This generational change must start with the saturation of education: education in schools, education at home, education at work—in sporting clubs, businesses and industry—not just for six months, not for a year but year after year until the message is heard and listened to and the language and the actions of respect are the norm rather than the exception. And I look forward to working with my colleagues across the floor.

                </a>
                . As those who have spoken before me have expressed, domestic and family violence is a national crisis and a national shame. One in four women have experienced family violence and one in five women have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. Australian police deal with a domestic violence matter every two minutes, with an estimated 657 domestic violence matters, on average, every single day of the year. These are shocking statistics but they are not just numbers. These women are our mothers, grandmothers, sisters, daughters, friends, neighbours and colleagues, and they all have the right to be safe and to live free from violence and fear.

                I would like to do my part to end men's violence towards women and children, as a political leader and as a man, and that's why I'm taking up Emily's call to action.

                To date our public conversation around violence, perhaps understandably, has focussed on a crisis response, and the onus has been on the victim-survivor to leave the violent relationship. And in response to this public conversation we often hear the words 'not all men'. Well I've never met a domestic violence frontline worker or victim-survivor who has claimed that all men are bad and perpetrate violence. That is not what they are advocating for. But all men do have a responsibility to help change the culture that allows this gendered violence to occur. As Tarang Chawla, an advocate whose sister was murdered at the hands of her partner, said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                If we have a room of 10 men, and one of them is a potential killer, and the other nine men there are silent, they might as well not be there.
               </p>
               <p>
                We must address this gender inequity together. We must end a culture where women are mistreated and discriminated against based on their gender. I feel this and I am committed to this, not just because I am the father of a daughter but because, quite frankly, it's just the right thing to do.

                . I recommend you visit Our Watch to find resources for how you can help change the culture and prevent men's violence against women because we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves, to call out poor behaviour, to reflect on our own actions and to listen to the women around us.

                I would like to conclude by saying that if you or someone you know is experiencing violence you can call 1800RESPECT. For counselling advice and support for men who have anger, relationship or parenting issues you can call the Men's Referral Service on 1300766491. We have set a goal to eliminate violence against women over a generation. That is an ambition I share, and as a man I am pledged to support the strength, the courage and the work of Australian women seeking to achieve this important goal. It's time to end this national shame.

                  International Day
                 </a>
                 for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and the beginning of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. I would like to thank Minister Rishworth and Assistant Minister Elliot for marking that occasion with statements in the House and commend them on their ongoing work towards eliminating violence against women.

                 In Australia, one woman dies every 10 days at the hands of her former or current partner. One in two women will experience sexual harassment in their lifetime—that means 50 per cent of all adult women you know have experienced, may currently be experiencing or will experience sexual harassment. And every two minutes in this country police deal with a domestic or family violence matter, but let's call them what they are—assaults.
                </p>
                <p>
                 While it is true to say the violence against women happens across every community in Australia, across every demographic and every postcode, we know that some women are more likely to experience violence. Aboriginal and
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 women are 11 times more likely to be killed due to family violence than non-Indigenous women. And women with disability are more than twice as likely to experience domestic or family violence than those without disability. Compounding social disadvantages also play a role in increasing a woman's risk of experiencing violence. But let's be clear: there are no excuses, there are no reasons. Violence is never acceptable.

                 and Children 2022-2032. Importantly, this government, along with all states and territories, has committed to a shared goal of ending gendered violence within a generation. This is a very ambitious goal, there's no denying it, but it's critical. Women and children have a right to feel safe in our communities, and that's why we're investing a record $1.7 billion towards that goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our national plan involves actions that could be structured into four broad domains. Prevention: we will work to change the underlying social drivers of violence by addressing not only the attitudes, but also the systems that give rise to violence against women and children—to stop it before it starts. Early intervention: we will focus our efforts on identifying and supporting individuals who are at high risk of experiencing or perpetrating violence. And, to be clear, we do need to work with perpetrators and those at risk. Response: we will continue to build on, and improve, services and supports to support victims-survivors experiencing violence, such as crisis support and police intervention and a trauma-informed justice system. Recovery and healing: the plan has a focus on reducing the risk of retraumatisation and supporting victims-survivors to be healthy and safe, and to recover from trauma in terms of both the physical and the mental, emotional and economic impacts of violence.
                </p>

                 The national plan also works in collaboration with our implementation of the recommendations of the

                 report—which passed parliament last week—because women should be safe in the workplace as well. And, of course, there is the 10 days of paid domestic violence leave because a woman shouldn't have to choose between her job and her safety.

                 Boothby is filled with wonderful women's organisations. These groups often do unrecognised work, providing safe places, resources and other supports and awareness raising, for women in our community. I particularly want to acknowledge the Zonta Club of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">
                  Adelaide Hills
                 </a>
                 . Zonta are participating in the 16 days of activism campaign, which calls for action against one the world's most persistent and insidious human rights violations: violence against women. Zonta in the Adelaide Hills are holding displays in community settings which highlight the importance of stopping violence. They are providing local businesses and offices, including my own electorate office in Glenelg, with posters. Ours is proudly displayed in our office in Boothby.

                 I spent my last three years of high school education at an all-girls school. It's the sort of school that does high school reunions. The 10-year reunion was about careers and marriages and how lucky and happy we all were. The 20-year reunion was about children: every one a gifted student. The 30-year reunion, sadly, was about divorce. Then the true stories came out: the woman whose first marriage lasted three months because her new husband broke her leg; the woman who endured a 25-year marriage of financial and social control, threats and violence, followed by a couple of years of abuse via the legal system; the woman whose ex-husband kept driving past her house, years after their separation, knowing that that was enough to terrify her after decades of conditioning—just knowing that he was somewhere nearby; and the woman who was too frightened to leave, knowing her husband had the financial wherewithal and contacts to take the children and leave her destitute. These were secrets that had been kept for years. There were women and children living in fear and misery; women thinking it was only them having that sort of experience or conditioned to think that it was because of them—that it was their fault; women terrified to leave because they knew it would anger him; and women terrified to stay because it was only getting worse. Sometimes family didn't even know. Sometimes they did know, but they didn't support the woman to leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Working in the homelessness system and in women's health and safety services, I saw women from all walks of life. Domestic and family violence was very often a part of how they had become homeless, and sometimes it was years after the actual experience of violence, because the trauma that comes from experiencing violence stays with you. The trauma that comes from being psychologically manipulated, being belittled and undermined, being isolated from family and friends and being financially manipulated has lifelong impacts. Homelessness, joblessness, poverty and loss of family are just some of those impacts. No-one deserves violence, and no-one should expect it or have to live with it. This must end.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is no place in our society for violence against women, and that's why I'm proud to stand here today to recognise, on behalf of the people of Boothby, the government's support for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.
