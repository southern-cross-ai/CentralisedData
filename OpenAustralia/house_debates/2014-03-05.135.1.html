        I rise this morning to talk about three wonderful school in my electorate that have fabulous staff and outstanding students. The Manunda Terrace Primary School advises me that they have selected their house captains after the nominees gave some wonderful speeches. Through a democratic process, the following students were elected as house captains. For Neptuna house, Elisa Niki and Tamikah Lister were elected. For Peary, it was Cody Kane and Thaianne Edwards. For Tulagi, Levi Nichaloff and Ieasha Friel were elected. Student representatives to the

Elected as student leadership council representatives were Mystique Mason, Brendan Hart, Renee Nichols, Scott Sutherland, Chloe Wright, Nathan Crosthwaite, Skye McPharlin, Denzel Tomlins, Samantha Hart, Ricky Tomlins, Lorraine Randall, Cameron Hyde, Bailey Howard and Ashanti Morgan. The sports house captains for Chaney are Lyle Byrne and Sarah Forrest, with Pavlos Mastronikolas and Rianna Carlson the vice-captains. For Nelson, the captains are Patrick Chester and Anna Thai and the vice-captains are Sam Murray and Autumn Sengpho. For Archer, the captains are Brodie Lake and Erin Lasker, with the vice-captains Darcy Simpson and Aaliyah McCourt. Finally, for Johnston, the sports house captains are Jackie Huang and Charli Nomoa, while the vice-captains are

        and Toya Norris.

        It is wonderful that the schools have democratically elected these wonderful people and I hope they get the support they need from their classmates to be great leaders.
