       <p>
        One in two Australians will be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 85. This is an alarming statistic. As part of the national fundraising initiative of the Cancer Council, Australia's Biggest Morning Tea is a fabulous opportunity to connect and join our communities together to fight this terrible disease.

        I was very privileged to have been able to host a Biggest Morning Tea at St Marys Rugby League Club on Thursday last week. It was wonderful for me to have Suzi Ji there, a woman who is currently suffering from cancer. I note her bravery in being able to talk through her journeyâ€”what she has encountered through her time with cancer. My friend Gina Costa was also there. Yesterday marked one year since Gina lost her beloved mum. It has been such an emotional journey for Gina, who still, every day, mourns the loss of her mother.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to thank everybody who attended. I would like to thank the St Marys Rugby League Club, who funded the entire event, putting on the morning tea for everyone, and particularly

        , who is a patriarch in my community. I would implore members to also host their own Biggest Morning Tea. For anyone who chooses to donate, please go to biggestmorningtea.com.au. Thank you.
