       <p>
        Tragically, 22 of the 23 recorded COVID-19 deaths in Victoria in the past 24 hours are related to aged care. Yet , earlier today in the Senate, this government's aged - care minister turned his back on his responsibility and walked out — walked out when the Senate was trying to ascertain what was going on.
       </p>
       <p>
        You don't see aged - care workers turning their back s on their responsibilities . They're turning up to work, working double shifts, working seven -day rosters back to back and putting themselves at risk . You don't see healthcare workers turning their back s on their responsibilities. They're turning up to work. Our nurses are turning up to work, making sure that people are safe and making sure that people get the health care that they need. You don't see retail workers turning their back s on their responsibilities. T hey're turning up to work , despite the high risk in our shopping centres —because we know that infection can spread there. You don't see cleaners not turning up to work , turning their back s on their responsibilities; t hey're doing their bit to help keep us safe. Yet we have an aged - care minister in this country who turns his back not just on the sector but on his job , a nd we have a Prime Minister who won't stand up and take responsibility for either the minister's action or what's happening in aged care. It's a disgrace.
