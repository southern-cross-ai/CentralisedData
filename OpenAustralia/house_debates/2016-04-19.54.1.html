        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House the central role of small business in the government's economic plan to manage the transition to the new economy? Is the Prime Minister aware of any risks to the viability of family businesses as key drivers of jobs and growth in communities across the country?

          The greatest risks to small business in this country are sitting opposite. It is the Labor Party that has shown again and again its determination to drive small business out of business. We have seen a Labor Party tribunal established as part of a dirty deal with the

          , established by the Leader of the Opposition with the express purpose of putting out of business owner-drivers, and it fulfilled its objectives perfectly. The Transport Workers Union were delighted. All of those independent operators—all of those mums and dads who borrowed money to buy their rigs, to get a start, to be independent and to realise their dreams—were put out of business. Thousands and thousands of trucks were idle. Thousands and thousands of businesses were out of business. Thanks to the coalition and to our determination to stand up for business and to stand up for jobs—

            that tribunal has been abolished. Its abolition was opposed tooth and nail by the Labor Party.

           <p>
            It was only yesterday that the member for Chifley, who is so sensitive to the concerns of the owner-drivers in his electorate, described their concerns as a 'stunt'—wonderful! Men and women out of jobs—I suppose if you have a safe Labor seat in the House of Representatives, you do not have to worry too much about the precarious existence of small business men and women. But we do, because we know that is where the jobs come in Australia. That is what drives our economy and that is what drives jobs growth. It is the enterprise, the determination and the courage of those small business men and women, who are having a go every day. We stand up for them.
           </p>

            Every policy the Labor Party propose in this coming election will be a job-destroying policy. They are going to discourage investment by putting up capital gains tax by 50 per cent. If you want less of something, increase the tax on it. Labour clearly wants less investment. They do not want people to borrow money—

              and have a go and start a business. They do not want people to borrow money and buy a rig, or buy some property. No, they are going to ban negative gearing. Only wealthy people with investment income and only companies with lots of income will be able to negative gear, but ordinary men and women—the small business men and women like the ones we were with on Sunday—will not get a start under Labor. Under Bill Shorten's view of the world, those men and women will have no choice—join the big union. That is not the Australia we believe in. We believe in a free Australia, an enterprising Australia and an Australia with great jobs.
