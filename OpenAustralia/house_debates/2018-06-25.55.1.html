        I rise to pay further tribute to awardees of

        honours from my electorate of Robertson and congratulate all recipients across the coast, including Jocelyn Maughan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        and her late husband, Robin Norling, who also received an OAM, posthumously. Jocelyn and Robin met 26 years ago and quickly became an incredible team who dedicated much of their lives to the arts not only on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        but also in New South Wales. After travelling the globe, Jocelyn and Robin returned to Australia in late 1966, where they both continued with their work in art education. Throughout her career as an art educator, Jocelyn worked as a senior head teacher of art and design across a number of institutions, including Meadowbank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        . Robin worked as a lecturer, writer and presenter, as well as spending nearly 10 years as the senior education officer at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
         Art Gallery
        </a>
        of New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jocelyn and Robin then moved up to Patonga, on the Central Coast, and in 1993 bought the local Bakehouse Gallery. In 2000, they reopened the gallery, and it has been operating since then as a community-focused space. Nearly two decades later, Jocelyn still has the studio at the back, and she told me just this morning that she was there working on a new piece. For Jocelyn and Robert, their passion for what they called old-fashioned art values of composition and drawing fuelled their commitment to art education. They've both been enormous supporters of the Central Coast art community, giving back and supporting local artists wherever possible, something that Jocelyn continues to do in Robin's memory.
