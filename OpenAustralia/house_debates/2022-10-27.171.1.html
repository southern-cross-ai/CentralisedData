        I spent last Sunday on the bowling green at the Chirnside Park Country Club with a group of inspiring individuals of Bowls Gr8 for Brains. Bowls Gr8 for Brains is a not-for-profit organisation that brings together veterans, current defence personnel and frontline emergency service workers to reconnect, improve their mental health and develop bowling skills. The organisation exists to minimise the risk of self-harm and suicide through empowerment, engagement and the strengthening of relationships through participation in bowls.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an absolute privilege to meet the co-founder of Bowls Gr8 for Brains, Darryl Coventry, to hear his personal story and learn how Bowls Gr8 for Brains began. The organisation is a result of Darryl's own battle with mental health trauma. Darryl is an ex-police officer who overcame some major challenges in both his professional and his personal life. The work Darryl is now doing as a volunteer to improve the lives of others is truly inspiring. Bowls Gr8 for Brains all began when Darryl walked into a bowling club one day and quickly found the positive impact sporting clubs can have on mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken in this chamber previously about the safe place I found through sport, and it was amazing to hear that so many others are finding that same sense of belonging through Bowls Gr8 for Brains. Those involved in Bowls Gr8 for Brains describe the group as their therapy, and for others it has literally been a lifesaver. For those who experience

        , bowls stimulates brain functions and helps bring the mind to the present moment. It was an honour to be asked to say a few words at the event, to thank all the volunteers who have brought this initiative together and to thank all those emergency service workers and service men and women in the room. After the formalities, I then got to see the bowlers in action. There was banter and smiles all round as Darryl, Troy, Paul, Happy and the crew battled it out on the green.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bowls Gr8 for Brains has several venues across the country and has just launched in Victoria. They will now be playing at the Chirnside Park Country Club once a month, with each session supervised by a qualified lawn bowls coach and volunteers with experience in supporting mental health. I am delighted that the organisation is coming to Casey. I look forward to joining them on the green. Sport provides opportunities for friendship and fitness while boosting mental health.
