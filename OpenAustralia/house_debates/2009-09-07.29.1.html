        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">

        has today in writing, in this letter, confirmed to me that the schools stimulus display signs are electoral advertisements, will the minister undertake to ensure that all other promotion of the

         I thank the shadow minister for his question. As the shadow minister would be aware, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
          AEC
         </a>
         has also referred to the arrangements that we have announced in relation to the signs, which satisfy the requirements for authorisation. It strikes me as passing strange that the shadow minister would have become so concerned about this topic, given the track record of the former government when it came to signage and recognition arrangements. I have some material here that I could go to but I do not want to restrain the House for too long on this question. I draw the House’s attention to the Investing in Our Schools Program
         <i>
          Guidelines for state schools
         </i>
         . That was the one we were referring to a little bit earlier with the 80 per cent costing. It says:

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister was asked a specific question about whether she would ensure that the website and literature associated with the schools stimulus debacle were compliant with the Electoral Act, and I would ask her to answer the question. I am also happy to table the school program guidelines.

               I have been asked about programs and compliance with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Electoral Commission
               </a>
               guidelines. Obviously, precedence and what has happened in the past are relevant to this. My attention has been, and I think the House’s attention probably should be, drawn to the fact that under the old Investing in Our Schools Program guidelines if you ended up with a school grant and, say, bought 5,000 books for your library every one of them had to have a sticker included in it. Every piece of material bought with the Investing in Our Schools Program money—10,000 books or 5,000 books—needed to have a sticker in it. Having had my attention drawn to this sticker here—it is very small print, so it may be challenging for some of us—I actually do not see an authorisation. I do not see an authorisation that would satisfy the Australian Electoral Commission on it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whilst we are on the question of school signs and other things, my attention has also been drawn to signage under the Investing in Our Schools Program. Here is one example, at the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wantirna_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
                Wantirna Primary School
               </a>
               , that actually told you who opened the project. It helpfully tells you that it was
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pearce" rel="nofollow">
                Chris Pearce
               </a>
               , the member for Aston. It tells you that he opened the project, obviously, at a school. Once again, it is not authorised in terms of Australian Electoral Commission style authorisation. Whilst I may be straying onto—

                Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, and a very important one as it relates to keeping the law. It is the obligation of ministers to comply with the law of Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister is not answering and giving a guarantee to the place. If she thinks two wrongs make a right she should, of course, admit to it.

I thank him for his very frank concession that the Howard government behaved in a wrong fashion when it was in office. I thank him for that concession and say that he, at least, is an honest man on those topics. The Howard government behaved wrongly in office—here comes an apology for it.

                   Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister was asked specifically whether she would ensure that the website and the literature were compliant with the Electoral Act, and I ask you—

                    The member for Sturt will resume his seat. There is no point of order. The Deputy Prime Minister will respond to the question.

                     Finally, though it may be straying onto the portfolio responsibilities of the minister for infrastructure, my attention has also been drawn to this sign under Roads to Recovery, just outside a school fence. No authorisation on that one. I think the minister would confirm to me that under the
