        I rise today to put on record a significant event at which I had the privilege of representing the Minister for Veteransâ€™ Affairs, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Griffin" rel="nofollow">

        , in Darwin last month. The event was the 66th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. Much has been said about the bombing of Darwin, and in the chamber on 18 February the Hon. Alan Griffin spoke of the significance of the event. It is also appropriate at this point to remember the bravery of the crew of the Australian flagship

        I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight the tragic losses that occurred in Darwin Harbour during the first wave of attacks on Australian soil. Eight ships were sunk in Darwin Harbour and 15 were damaged. Two merchant ships were sunk near

        records that one of the first bombs severed the wharf from its shore approaches and killed 22 waterside workers. It is this group that I would like to put on record, highlighting their bravery and courage. After 7 December 1941, nobody was conscripted to work on the wharf. The reason for this was the danger associated with the work. At worst an invasion was anticipated and at best they could expect to be bombed. All the men on the wharves were there because they chose to be, and each and every one of them knew their work environment was inherently dangerous. This was a clear and unmistakable testament to the courage and commitment of these wharfies.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was highlighted in the story of John Cubillo and George Tye, two of the 70 waterside workers on the wharves when the Japanese attacked. History tells us John and George were not rostered to work that day. However, they knew that they would be two men short, so they wanted to help out their mates, so they dutifully went to work. As fate would have it, only George returned home. As bombs were dropping all around them and George was swimming for his life, he saw John running along the wharf trying to get to shore. Moments later a bomb exploded just where John had been. The wharf had taken several direct hits, and several sections had broken away. Twenty-two waterside workers did not return home from that day, a tragic price to pay for doing your job. Once again, as the 66th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin has just passed, I would like to have put on record the bravery and courage of the 22 waterside workers killed during the bombing.
