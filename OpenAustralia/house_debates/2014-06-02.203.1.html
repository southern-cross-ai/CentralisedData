        At different times between 1911 and 1972 Australia has had national service. I know the member for Bass, who is me, had a distinguished career. In that time 238,000 people who have served. It was a great honour yesterday to be invited to attend Burwood and District National Servicemen's Commemorative Service Day. It was an even greater honour after the election to be contacted by Ms Rhonda Kelly and asked to become the group's patron, which I grabbed with both hands.

        Particularly of note in my family's history is that when Sydney training happened at Holsworthy the nearest pub in those days was the Crossroads at Ingleburn. My father, Arthur, was the licensee between 1959 and 1962. My grandparents had the pub for years and the affiliation of my family with the nashos in those days—'nashos' being, obviously, a term of affection—was one of great pride. It was my honour yesterday to attend the service. I would like to thank all those from 1911 to 1972 for their service. I would like to thank those for yesterday's celebration and for bestowing upon me the honour of becoming their patron.
