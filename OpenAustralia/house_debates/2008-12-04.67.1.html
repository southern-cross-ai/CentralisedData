         I thank the member for Corio for his question, which will be the last question in the parliamentary session this year.

         perhaps echo a theme started by the member for Batman, that there would be many members in this parliament and many members of the Australian community who are looking forward to some quiet time at the end of the year and a few holiday pursuits. Amongst the things that people might be thinking of doing as they move towards the festive season and get a bit of quiet time is going to the movies. Of course, one of the movies they may be going to see would be the new movie

           Yes, a romantic. The Acting Leader of the Opposition is suggesting he must be a romantic because he did take himself off to that movie very quickly and came back with good reports. That movie is one way of showing Australian landscapes and Australian stories to the world. One way in which we think about ourselves and work through in our own minds what it means to be Australian is through the images reflected in popular culture. There would be many members of this House who grew up with images of
           <i>
            Skippy
           </i>
           ,

           and various other shows that have reflected to us what it is to be Australian.

           I actually rise at the end of question time to deal with a rumour I know is sweeping through the corridors of

            Parliament House
           </a>
           . It may be concerning people, but there is no truth in the rumour that over the summer break members of the opposition will be filming an Australian version of
           <i>
            Batman

           but did not do quite so well with the superhero bit. I am informed that the member for Sturt screen tested very well as Robin. You can imagine him in that role. I am informed that various members of the Liberal front bench screen tested well in the roles of the Riddler and the Joker, and I am informed that the Acting Leader of the Opposition, in the honourable tradition of
