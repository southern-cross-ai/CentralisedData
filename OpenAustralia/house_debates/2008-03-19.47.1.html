        Mr Deputy Speaker, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Deputy Speaker’s ruling be dissented from.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will speak to this motion now, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is unprecedented for a government to move such a motion. Clearly, the Labor Party have not worked out that they actually are in government. They are moving this sort of spurious motion to try to get television time tonight. The Leader of the House rang me yesterday and said, ‘We want to get through our bills tomorrow. Can you cut short your speakers list so that we can get through our bills?’ and then the government moved an absurd motion like this.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order, which is in your interest. You would be aware that this is a motion of dissent from your ruling. The member opposite has to refer to your ruling, which upheld a point of order moved by me, based upon
         <i>
          House of Representatives Practice
         </i>
         , that the House had determined a question. He has to refer to your ruling. He has not mentioned one thing about your ruling.

          <p>
           Absolutely; I am more than happy to do so. Mr Deputy Speaker, we have moved a motion of dissent from your ruling, because there has been a rich history in this place on these issues, particularly in relation to when the now member for Warringah was Leader of the House. On numerous occasions the then opposition moved motions, and then subsequent motions, to close him down. If this is the way they are organised in the chamber, Lord knows how they are organised on the Expenditure Review Committee and Lord knows how they are organised in relation to getting the budget right. It should come as no surprise that they have not got any answers in relation to the Chinese trips by the now minister for agriculture, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.

                      They run the parliament. It is the government that set down the order of business for the day. It is the government that set down the legislative agenda for the House. Here they are moving a motion on their own time during government business. They do not understand the standing orders. This is what you call a political stunt by the government.

                        How ironic it is that the Labor Party now have not yet realised that they are in government. They are moving motions in this chamber to suspend standing orders. I have no recollection in 11 years of the Howard government that the government ever lost control of the chamber in the way that the Labor government have lost control of the chamber today, let alone their having moved a motion like that one—there is no precedent for it. We are going back into the Hawke years as we stand, trying to find a precedent. This just illustrates that these people are more interested in stunts, more interested in the charade of government, than in making hard decisions. How ironic it is that they had to move 34 amendments to their own

                          In my view the reason that the Deputy Speaker’s ruling should be overturned by this chamber is that the decision is wrong. The decision is clearly wrong. The decision is wrong, based on precedents involving the member for Warringah and based on precedents involving the previous Manager of Opposition Business, who on numerous occasions moved that the Leader of the House be no longer heard and moved subsequent motions within the speaking time allocated to the Leader of the House. Of course, what we know is that the Leader of the House in this place does not understand his own standing orders. He does not understand his own standing orders, and that is why he tried to move that we be no longer heard, in a debate on a motion of dissent.

                                    We want to get on with the business of the House. We want to get on with dealing with the government’s legislative timetable. It is the government that have suspended their own standing orders to bring on a motion full of politics, vitriol and rhetoric—the same old tired stuff that they had been running in opposition. They ran it in opposition. They won the election; we accept that they won the election. But now that they are in government they actually have to make some decisions. I know it is going to come as a rude shock to the Treasurer, who should be out there studying the economics books rather than in here being party to a political stunt.

                                               Thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I think I was, quite correctly, pointing out the circumstances of this dissent motion. The member for
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

                                               quite rightly is concerned by the ruling that you have given that a motion that a member be no longer heard cannot be moved against the same person speaking at a particular point in time. The dissent motion is that that ruling was incorrect—in fact, a motion that a member be no longer heard can be moved at any time. The precedent for that is very clear. I have been in this parliament since 1993, and the member for Warringah has been here since 1994. I remember times when such motions that a member be no longer heard were taken by the then opposition against the member for Warringah when he was the Minister for Employment Services.

                                                         Of course, it has been complied with. It was complied with right at the beginning of the debate. Unlike you, we know that you have to put dissent motions in writing, have them moved and seconded. That is why it was put down right at the beginning of the debate, you silly goose! No wonder everyone behind you is talking about getting rid of you as Leader of the House. My point is that we have dissented from the Deputy Speaker’s ruling because his ruling was wrong. It breaches precedent previously established in this House. If the right of the House to ask a member to be no longer heard is taken away from the opposition or, in fact, any member of the parliament, it would be a huge breach of the parliamentary requirements of the Westminster system. This right allows the opposition or any member to move that a member be no longer heard when they are being irrelevant, when they are traducing the good name of the parliament and when they are using motions such as the one moved by the government for stunts rather than for getting on with the business of government.

I can remember being in this chamber when I was the Minister for Employment Services and moving a suspension motion on the then member for Dickson. I can remember—and I invite the clerks to go back and look at the

If it was good enough for the then opposition to close government ministers within a few seconds of the resolution of a previous motion, if it was good enough for the occupant of the chair on that day to allow successive closure motions, the precedent has been set and we are perfectly entitled to move a closure motion on this minister, who has not learnt a new script since she got into government. It was all very well in opposition to run this anti

                                                           When you are a minister in this country, you cannot govern this country by constantly repeating a mantra of opposition; you have actually got to make decisions—and that is what this government has not done in the 3½ months in which it has been in office. I refer to no greater authority than the former Leader of the Labor Party, the former member for Werriwa, who has said that this new government has engaged in nothing less than a circus of symbolism since it has been in office. This stunt today is the very quintessence of symbolism. It demonstrates that, rather than get on with government, it is still running the same tired old script. It is basically an opposition which found its way into government because of the longevity of the incumbents, and now it is trying to work out what to do. That is the problem that this government has: it does not actually know what to do now that it finds itself in government. Come on! I say to members opposite, ‘Surely after all those years as union organisers, surely after all those years of delving deeply into workplace law, you must know something about this.’

But, with our losing the election, members opposite are now in government, and they simply have to get on with the task of governing. Constantly running the sorts of stunts that we saw this morning, having deceived the opposition about their desire to get on with government business, having engaged in a rank act of deception, pulling on this stunt and then pulling that bogus point of order, which, unfortunately, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have upheld, really demonstrates that the former member for Werriwa,

                                                           Frankly, the time of this parliament is being needlessly consumed by a government which should know better. It is constantly running the old lines at the behest of a minister for workplace relations who was moderately effective in opposition—I will grant her that. But the task is not to criticise the former government; the task now is to be a good government in the stead of the former government. I have to say that the longer this mob opposite is in place, the better the Howard government is going to look. The longer this mob is in place, the more likely that the people of Australia will look back to 2.1 million new jobs, a 21 per cent increase in real wages and a doubling of the real net wealth of Australians as a golden age to which they would like to aspire at the next election.

                                                            Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak against the dissent motion and in favour of your ruling. In doing so can I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is apparent from the quality of the debate that this dissent motion is not actually about your ruling; it is about buying time for the opposition and the Liberal Party to work out how they want to vote on the motion I have moved. They are trying to characterise that motion as unimportant, but it calls on them to do a very important thing. The reason this dissent motion has been moved is to prevent them for some time from having to come to this point of decision.

I am sure it is a matter of much regret to you and the members opposite that they were unable to hear my contribution in this debate. It is of great concern to us that, whilst we respect your ruling, in this case the matter has not been appropriately dealt with. The people of Australia are really expecting action from this government. There are very important matters before this House today that the people of Australia are expecting to be dealt with. But what do we have? As a result of the opposition-like tactics of the members opposite we see the time of this House wasted and, rather than the important matters of the day such as the cost of living, such as how carers and pensioners are going to continue to live against the backdrop of rising prices, we see a childish and trivial stunt by this government, taking up the time of this House. I know that this government can kick carers around, and it can kick seniors around, but we as the opposition do not want to see that happening and we do not want to see it attempt to kick the parliamentary process around. I know that the actions of this government are already causing great distress amongst the people whom I represent. I recommend that the government should be putting its energies into good government rather than political stunts. There is no mileage to be had from this government pulling political stunts and embarking on endless symbolism when in fact—
