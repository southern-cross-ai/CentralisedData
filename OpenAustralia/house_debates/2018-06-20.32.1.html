       <p>
        I'm proud to be a men's health ambassador. Last week we celebrated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_Health_Week" rel="nofollow">
         Men's Health Week
        </a>
        . To mark the occasion, I was proud to sponsor a men's health expo, which was held in Darwin, down at Raintree Park. I want to thank Jason Bonson for pulling the event together, and I want to acknowledge all the stakeholders who made it such a great success. It's getting bigger every year.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the organisations that participated in the expo was the Darwin Men's Shed. It is great to have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Australian Men's Shed Association, David Helmers, with us today. It was great to have David visit our Darwin and Palmerston men's sheds recently. I was impressed to learn that up there in Darwin we've got one of the only 3D printing set-ups in a men's shed anywhere in the country. It's a great idea for men's sheds to get into that new technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge all the men's sheds around the country and the important work they do, especially for our senior Australian men out there. Members of men's sheds aren't doctors, but they save lives. They're not psychiatrists, but they help the mental health of our men—our uncles, our fathers and even our sons.
       </p>
       <p>
        To finish up—because it isn't all about the blokes—I'd like to acknowledge a delegation of female electricians that is here today from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It's great to see strong female leadership in our union movement—
