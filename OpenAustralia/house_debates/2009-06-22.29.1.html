        My question is to the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services. Minister, are you concerned about reports of misleading conduct with regards to the sale of Australian insurance companies? How important is it that people in the financial services industry maintain the highest standards of conduct, accountability and integrity? Minister, what recent threats have there been to these standards?

         I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. When it comes to the proper functioning of markets and our public debate, it is more than a little important that the highest standards of integrity and honesty be maintained. Our legal framework for dealing with deceptive conduct in the business world is also vital to ensure that consumers and investors are fully informed in making financial decisions, because without access to truthful information the market simply would not function properly as poor economic decisions would be made. Investors, companies and consumers have the right to truthful information—much the same as citizens and voters have the right to that truthful information.

         I was asked about concerns about the sale of certain insurance companies. The House may be aware of concerns relating to the tactics that surrounded the selling of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAI" rel="nofollow">
          FAI
         </a>
         insurance to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIH" rel="nofollow">
          HIH
         </a>
         , which played a very important role in the downfall of HIH. In 1997,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs" rel="nofollow">
          Goldman Sachs
         </a>
         Australia considered being a party to the purchase of FAI. After a thorough study of the business of FAI, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Australia concluded that the business was in bad shape and was worth very little. That chairman was Mr Malcolm Turnbull.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 7 September 1998, Mr Turnbull sent a memorandum to Goldman Sachs executives in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
          New York
         </a>
         advising them that the assets of the business were worth very little. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We estimate that the true net assets of FAI (that is, after write-downs and unwinding of reinsurance contracts) is approximately $20 million, compared with a stated book value of $220 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fair enough. They did their work with due diligence and decided that it was not worth very much at all. But Mr Turnbull then agreed to help Mr Rodney Adler sell FAI insurance. In the process of finding a buyer, it would be common practice for FAI to appoint an independent valuation expert to give potential buyers some information about the value of the business. Mr Turnbull not only did not advise them to do this; he advised them not to do it. Mr Turnbull wrote to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Adler" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Adler
         </a>
         recommending against the appointment of an independent financial examination of FAI, stating, “It may not be in FAI shareholders’ interests to have such an investigation conducted and presented.”
        </p>
        <p>
         On 11 January 1999—four months after Mr Turnbull argued that there was little value in the FAI business—on the basis of information provided by FAI and Mr Turnbull the insurance firm HIH purchased FAI for $295 million.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hate to be pedantic, but there is a standing order about referring to members by their proper titles. We all know what the government is trying to do here. It is smear and smear and smokescreen.

                    I should disclose to the House that this matter has now been settled by a confidential settlement. We do not know the details but we know it has been settled. But there will be no confidential settlement about misleading behaviour on other matters in the House over the last few hours. There is nowhere to hide from this one. There will be no confidential settlement on lying about an email, because he might be able to hide behind a confidential settlement in the business world but you cannot hide behind one in politics.

                        The member for Warringah will resume his seat. Those on my right! Regrettably, the contention that the member for Warringah is putting to me is not correct. It is assumed that there should be a more robust debate which I, as the predominant person that was in the chair for the debate, allowed. I am now learning my lesson! It is usual, if we are going to have those robust charges made, that they are part of the motions that we are discussing, and on this occasion they were not. Perhaps, to clarify the matter I should have pulled up these comments earlier in the debate. I have indicated to the minister and those who follow that they should be a bit more careful with the language that they use.
