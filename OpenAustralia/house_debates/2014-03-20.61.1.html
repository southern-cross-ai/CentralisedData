         I thank the member for Kennedy for his question and I appreciate his concern. I appreciate the concerns of many members of this House, such as the member for Dawson sitting in front of him. I appreciate the concerns of all members on this side of the chamber and, indeed ,people on the crossbenchers, like the member for Kennedy.
        </p>
        <p>
         I appreciate his concern, and our concern, to try to ensure that the workers of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Isa
         </a>
         continue to have jobs—to try to ensure that those mines and plants in Mount Isa continue to operate. I do share the member's concern to try to ensure that nothing is done by government to make that harder and that whatever possible to make that easier is done by government. The best thing we could do in this House right now, and in the Senate right now, to help reduce the price of power is pass the carbon tax repeal legislation. Get rid of the carbon tax! Even on the members' opposite's own figures that would reduce the price of power by 10 per cent. That would be a material benefit not just for every household in our country, which would be $550 a year better off, but would also be a material benefit to the industries of places like Mount Isa.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do appreciate the question from the member for Kennedy. There is a measure before the parliament right now—right now—that could help the workers of Mount Isa, and that is scrapping the carbon tax. It is long overdue and members opposite should stop misleading the Australian public on this matter. They should stop saying one thin in Perth and doing the opposite here in Canberra. They should start to tell the Australian people the truth, and they should start acting with honour to help the workers and the households of our country.
