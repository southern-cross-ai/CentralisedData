         I did leave off 2019! But I won't torture the title again. That moved through this House on Tuesday evening and is presently the subject of consideration and debate in the Senate. I'm not aware whether or not the result of that consideration will be the bill's being passed with or without amendments or some other result. In those circumstances, it may be that you are minded to suspend the sittings until the ringing of the bells, at which point we will obviously have a better idea of the results of that debate in the Senate. The bill can either be dealt with here or I, as Leader of the House, can adjourn the proceedings.

          There's been good consultation between the Leader of the House and me. As was evident on Tuesday, when we facilitated the bill going through the House that night, there's been similar cooperation in the Senate with respect to making sure that the bill is debated. It's the bill which no-one seems to be able to read out loud and keep a straight face at the same time, so I won't even go to name it. While there's a chance it will go through there unamended, anyone who predicts the Senate is brave. With that in mind, the course of action recommended by the Leader of the House is supported by the opposition.

          <p>
           I thank both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business. As they both know, I will always seek to act in accordance with the sentiment of the House—particularly on a day like today, where we would be going back to the address-in-reply and which members like to prepare for. It's a very important contribution that they make.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I thank both of them for discussing that matter. I think it's a practical thing for members. There is no reason to keep the House going while we wait, so the House is suspended until the ringing of the bells.
