         The committee reports to the House that it has deliberated upon and adopted a process for its consideration of bills for referral to committees. The process is aimed at ensuring that the committee has the necessary information to enable it to judge whether committee scrutiny of a bill is warranted, and to be aware of any programming considerations. To support its considerations, the committee requests that private Members, when presenting bills to the House, also present an outline of the bill in, or as, an explanatory memorandum to the bill.

         In formulating the priority to be given to items of private Members’ business the Selection Committee shall have regard to:(a)   the importance of the subject;(b)   the current level of interest in the subject;(c)   the extent of the current discussion on the subject both in the Parliament and elsewhere;(d)   the extent to which the subject comes within the responsibility of the

         The Committee shall accord priority to private Members’ business:(a)   with regard to the numbers of Members affiliated with each party in the House;(b)   in a way which ensures that a particular Member or the Members who comprise the Opposition Executive do not predominate as the movers of the items selected;(c)   in a way which seeks to ensure balance is achieved over each period of sittings;

         When a private Member has the responsibility for the carriage of a bill transmitted from the Senate for concurrence, the bill shall be accorded priority following the question for the second reading being put to the House in the same way as a private Member’s bill originating in the House is accorded priority by standing order 41.

        <dt>
         4.
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Priority shall not be accorded to any item of private Members’ business if the matter should be dealt with by the House in another, more appropriate, form of proceeding.

         The general principles set out above shall be observed by the Selection Committee but nothing in the general principles shall be taken to prevent the Selection Committee departing from those general principles in order to meet circumstances, which, in its opinion, are unusual or special.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         6.
        </dt>
        <dd>
         These general principles shall continue in effect until altered by the House following a report from this or a future Selection Committee.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p>
        The committee has asked that I draw the House’s attention to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the amendment to the Selection Committee’s report No. 2. Here the committee outlines difficult constraints that the standing orders have placed on the committee’s deliberations of allocating times for speakers when debating private members’ bills. The committee seeks the House’s assistance in addressing these constraints.
