        People in regional Australia live far from the big cities and it is important that they also be given a voice in federal affairs. My electorate of Capricornia in Central and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Queensland
        </a>
        is 91,049 square kilometres. Last week, I continued my series of 'all ears' listening tours around regional parts of the electorate to listen to what people had to say.

        , west of Mackay, I met with publican Karen Collyer at the Criterion Hotel and with a number of local residents. Small-business owners like Karen are important to our small country towns and sidings, and I would like to thank her for her hospitality. I also met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        at Gargett, also in the Pioneer Valley, and attended a lunch provided by CWA President, Mavis Head, and her members Connie Muscat, Dawn Breadsell, Mary Vassallo, Caryn Kempster, Anne Webster, Nola Duncan and Carolyn Tandridge. Recently I was thrilled to announced that after much lobbying we were able to secure a new mobile phone tower at Gargett to fix up mobile black spots. The Gargett branch of the CWA was formed in 1948. I thank the ladies for their warm hospitality and feedback on federal issues. I also met with Peter Woodland, chair of the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association, which represents dairy farmers from Eungella through to Rosmoya near Rockhampton and inland Queensland. I was delighted to meet Julie McEvoy and Ingrid Haviland of Platypus Playcare, a childcare centre in Finch Hatton, and to present them with an Aboriginal and

        I also held a listening post at the Marian Town Centre. Marian is steeped in pioneering sugar and farming history, and the town's Edward Lloyd Park is the final location of Melba House. President of the Pioneer Valley Tourism and Development Association, Lyn McMurdo, kindly hosted me for a visit. This is the original homestead that
