        It's a great honour to stand here today and thank the two guest presenters that I had at the Wannon Sport and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_Awards" rel="nofollow">
         Volunteer Awards
        </a>
        . These awards recognise the outstanding achievements that we see in the Wannon electorate when it comes to the sporting field as well as in volunteering. For the volunteer awards, the guest presenter was Madi Bennett. Madi lost her mother to Huntington's disease at a very young age, and has done outstanding work promoting awareness about Huntington's disease and making sure that there are the supports that are necessary for those families who go through losing a loved one due to Huntington's disease. She spoke passionately and beautifully about her story, and I thank her for what she did.

        Our guest presenter for the sports awards was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Sefton" rel="nofollow">
         Clyde Sefton
        </a>
        . Clyde won a medal for Australia in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Munich Olympics
        </a>
        and a gold medal in Auckland. And he was absolutely outstanding, talking about the commitment that is needed to be able to perform at the highest level. Now, for those who remember Munich—that's where there was the terrorist attack—he talked about how he kept his concentration and was able to go on and perform at the height of his ability. I thank them both.
