        Today I rise to acknowledge the deeds of our local Rural Fire Service brigades in the electorate of Macquarie who, through their diligence and hard work, prevented what could have been another natural disaster earlier this year. On Saturday, 5 February, a fire broke out on a private property in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalong_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Megalong Valley
        </a>
        region of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        . That particular Saturday entered the history books, courtesy of a week-long heatwave that saw temperatures in the greater

        pass 40 degrees Celsius. The unseasonably wet start to summer had prevented the traditional back-burning of key bushlands and, when combined with the high humidity, created a dangerous level of ‘natural fuel’ for potential fires.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Narrow Neck, some 15 kilometres south of Katoomba,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hardy" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Hardy
        </a>
        was on duty in the fire tower. At approximately 11.35 am, Anthony Hardy raised the alarm that a fire had broken out in the Megalong Valley. The significance of Anthony Hardy’s actions on the morning of 5 February is that it was approximately another 15 minutes before triple zero had received a call alerting authorities to the fire and the related dangers. The extra 15 minutes, together with the expeditiousness of the local rural fire brigades, prevented a potential catastrophe as the heatwave conditions of that week had created a dangerous environment of natural fuel, which potentially could have seen the fire quickly spread from the valley to the escarpment, destroying hundreds of hectares of

        listed Blue Mountains and threatening the lives and property of people living in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the people of Macquarie, I offer our sincere thanks for the alertness and actions of Anthony Hardy and the efforts of the men and women of the Rural Fire Service brigades who brought the fire under control. Those brigades deserve a special mention: the Megalong Valley, Shipley, Blackheath, Katoomba-Leura,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medlow_Bath" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and South Katoomba brigades. I would also like to mention the brigades from Hartley and Kanimbla, who assisted in bringing the fire under control. The circumstances surrounding the fire are still under investigation by authorities, but I can advise that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Walker" rel="nofollow">
         Rod Walker

        , Operations Support Officer and Acting Inspector for the Blue Mountains District Rural Fire Service, and Inspector Paul McGrath, their support team and the brigades involved did an outstanding job, limiting the damages to four hectares, with no loss of personal property and, most importantly, no loss of life. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the efforts of all involved saved the residents of the Blue Mountains from, potentially, a natural disaster. On their behalf, I say a huge thankyou.
