       <p>
        Today I would like to recognise some of the wonderful disability support groups and organisations in our community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . This year is a very special anniversary for Technology for Ageing and Disability (South Australia) Inc., or TAD
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        , because it's celebrating its 40th anniversary. It is a not-for-profit volunteer organisation. TADSA has been serving the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        community for four decades with one goal: to improve the quality of life for South Australians who experience barriers in their lives due to disability or age.
       </p>
       <p>
        Formerly called Technical Aid to the Disabled (SA), TADSA specialises in modifying equipment as well as the design and manufacture of customised equipment to suit an individual's needs. The organisation's dedicated volunteers, with a wide range of specialised technical skills, have assisted thousands of South Australians to live more independent, dignified lives. For people who experience disability, having the right equipment in place makes a big difference in helping them to be independent and stay connected to their family, friends, workplace and community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fantastic TADSA volunteers can build or modify just about anything to make life that little bit easier, including wheelchairs, tables, workstations, clothes lines, walkers, cutlery, gardening tools or even fishing rods, to name just a few of the things that they do. A major community access program conceived by TADSA is the Freedom Wheels program, which provides modified bicycles for children who, through disability, are unable to ride a regular bike. Because of this program, these children can experience a new kind of independence and participate in activities so often taken for granted by others. I congratulate and thank all of the volunteers at TADSAâ€”in particular, founding members John Cappo,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Downing" rel="nofollow">

        , Kevin Neylon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Short" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Terry Cody. A special mention goes to Ken Lawson,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jackson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Julie Peak, who have each contributed 20 years of service. A very happy 40th anniversary to TADSA.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to speak about some other amazing organisations in my local area, one of which is the Suneden Specialist School, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Park
        </a>
        , which was the first special school in South Australia and does a truly wonderful job supporting students with intellectual and multiple physical disabilities. It also supports their families. I also have Kilparrin Teaching and Assessment School, in Park Holme, which provides on-site school programs and a statewide support service for students with sensory impairment and disabilities, including early intervention programs, which we know are absolutely crucial. I have Bedford, in Panorama, which provides supported employment, training and day care options that foster independence, socialisation and inclusion for our community. I also have Novita, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys
        </a>
        , and Minda, down at Brighton. I would like to recognise and thank all of the volunteers and staff at these incredible organisations for everything that they do.
