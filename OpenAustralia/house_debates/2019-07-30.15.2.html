       <p>
        I rise today to condemn this government's robo-debt system that is catching innocent Australians in its net. Designed to catch cheats, it is now reversing the onus of proof onto innocent Australians to demonstrate what they have already demonstrated. To put it in simple terms for those playing along at home, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        provides data matching that averages someone's salary across a 12-month period. If you were on Newstart for a six-week period in that 12-month financial year, you are likely to be given a robo-debt notice that tells you that you've done something wrong. Basically, it accuses you of defrauding the Commonwealth. There are hundreds of young people in my electorate who have knocked on my door, and I have sat with them as they've worked this through with Centrelink. I have heard the people on the end of the phone demand from them pay slips that do not reflect the period of time that they were getting social support. They are asking for pay slips that, in this day and age, not every young worker is receiving. That's another issue.
       </p>

        The robo-debt system is causing havoc for families. It is a scourge in this country. It is coming to a family near you if it hasn't already. There are thousands of young people who have accepted a debt that they did not owe, and there are thousands of others who've gone to local members, sought support and had their debt waived. The debt often didn't exist. This system is a failure. This government should review it and cancel it.
