       <p>
        On Australia Day this year, on a magnificent summer’s day, I had the honour on behalf of the Holt electorate to celebrate and publicly recognise unsung heroes in our community by presenting the Holt Australia Day awards to over 20 special people and organisations. It is a great Australian quality that many individuals in this great country give their time and effort in a typically understated way to help improve the lives of others. They ask for no recognition for their work. In fact, they are often embarrassed when their contributions are recognised, but I feel that they should be recognised because they are great role models for our young people and because of the hope that they offer to many. So I take this opportunity—and I hope that I do not run out of time—to mention the special individuals and organisations that were honoured at the Holt Australia Day Community Spirit Awards. On behalf of all of us here in this federal parliament, I want to thank them for their selfless service and contribution to our community.

        All of those people that I have mentioned here today in this place, through the threads of their many stories of their contribution to the community, sum up to me—and I am sure to other members—what it means to be Australian.
