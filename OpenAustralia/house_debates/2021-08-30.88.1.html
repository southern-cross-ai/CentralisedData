        My question is to the Prime Minister. According to ABC reports last night, delivery drivers on the Amazon Flex platform don't get workers compensation or superannuation. They can effectively be sacked with no reason given. How will the Prime Minister prevent Australia's future being dominated by low-paid and insecure work like this?

         I thank the member for his question, and I will undertake to review the matter that he's raised here today and seek that information from the Minister for

         . What I do know is that our government has legislated to support the uncertainty of work of casuals in this country. That was the package of reforms that we brought through this parliament. They were the package of reforms that we worked through with those both in the business community and in the trade union movement. That was the initiative which I commenced in the middle of last year when I set out very clearly that there were many challenges that the country had to face going forward to be successful in a post-COVID world and to ensure that there were both the certainty and flexibility necessary for the Australian economy to perform and for people who are in uncertain work to get that certainty. That's why we introduced that legislation and that's why we supported it. I note the point that has been made by the member in raising that question. But I also note the important action that our government took to create certainty for those in casual work in this country by the legislation we introduced and we ensured went through this chamber and the other place.
