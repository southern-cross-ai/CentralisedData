        My question is to the Minister for Government Services. In my electorate the same record rainfall that's caused widespread flooding has also caused a massive landslide, which has cut off access to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Falls Creek
        </a>
        for at least five months, decimating the summer season economy. But those affected look at the Services Australia website and only see financial assistance for people directly affected by floods. Can the minister confirm that these people are eligible for the disaster recovery allowance, and are there plans for further support?

         I thank the member for her question. As all members here know, many local government areas right across Australia have been affected by incredibly damaging natural disaster events.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Falls Creek
         </a>
         , in the Alpine shire, in the north-east of Victoria, is one of 153 communities that are currently eligible for disaster assistance. There has been a landslide on the way to Falls Creek, and it's affected the businesses. Whilst Falls Creek is a year-round tourist facility, most of its business is in the winter, but there are businesses that seek to operate all year round. Residents of Falls Creek, I can inform the member, are eligible to apply for disaster recovery allowance and also Victorian and Commonwealth funded disaster recovery funding arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Services Australia has investigated for me today, in the course of the day, Falls Creek and whether or not there are payments which people are eligible for that haven't been made. As I understand it, there have been 46 claims made for disaster relief allowance. They've all been paid. There is one claim where the status is indeterminate, but 46 out of 47 have been made. In terms of the year-round businesses affected, that doesn't fall within the immediate preserve of Services Australia, and I'll certainly raise it with the Victorian government. But, as far as my ministerial obligations go, everyone who has put in a claim has actually had it processed. If there are other people who the member is aware of who haven't, we will of course attend to it straightaway.
        </p>
        <p>
         I just want to thank Services Australia staff. They've been working all around Australia, right from central

         through to Rochester in Victoria, and they're doing a great job. I send them our best wishes, from the parliament, for helping the people affected.
