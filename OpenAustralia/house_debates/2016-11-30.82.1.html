        My question is again to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . I refer to the minister's previous answer. The WA Treasurer told his parliament:
       </p>
       <p>
        We contacted the then Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Hon Christian Porter, who knows a lot about this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We put together the draft bill. We showed it to him and we showed it to the commonwealth. We got a letter from the commonwealth saying that it supported the action. We would not have proceeded without that support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why does the WA government provide a different account to what the minister just provided? Can the minister now outline his entire involvement in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Group" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        matter, which is the subject matter of his letter?

        <p>
         I thank the member for the question. Obviously, I have noted comments that have been made publicly by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         Treasurer,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nahan" rel="nofollow">
          Mike Nahan
         </a>
         . Obviously, when this matter became a matter of public note I searched my own recollection and cross referenced that with my diary. My absolute best recollection, which is supported by my recourse to my diary, is that there was a meeting with the Western Australia Treasurer, Mike Nahan, on 5 February 2015. We discussed a range of issues. I meet with Mike Nahan somewhat often. My recollection is that at that meeting he noted that the WA government was considering a legislative course to resolve the Bell litigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         One month later, on 18 March 2015, at this person's request I met with Mr Rod Whithear here at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . He is the managing director of the Insurance Commission of WA. At that meeting he provided me with an overview of the circumstances pursuant to which the WA government was considering a proposed legislative course to resolve the Bell litigation. And, again, having cross referenced my own memory with a search of my diary, my best recollection is that I did not receive any further information or have any further meeting specifically regarding the Bell legislation until the receipt of that email—that, in my previous question, I have described—on 2 March 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 2 March 2016 my office received the email that I have described from the Western Australian State Solicitor's Office. Those circumstances have been the subject of an accurate summary by the Attorney-General,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis" rel="nofollow">
          George Brandis
         </a>
         , and the subject of the response of my last answer. And I just note further than, as I indicated in my conversation with Senator Brandis on 3 March 2016, I have not been involved in any discussions with Mr Hockey's office and Western Australian ministers.
