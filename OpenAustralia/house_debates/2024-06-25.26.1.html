       <p>
        Thanks to the Albanese Labor government, the bottle has now been uncorked for growth in our wine regions. Earlier this year, import duties placed on Australian wine into China were lifted. After more than three years of facing tariffs of around 220 per cent, it has certainly been a long time between drinks.

        In the first month of the tariffs being lifted,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        n winemakers exported almost $80 million worth of wine into China. At the same time, our government is helping to unlock the door to other markets, such as Thailand, one of the fastest-growing markets for wine in the world. The uplifting effect of this change is already being felt across the country, and particularly within my home state of South Australia, including my electorate of Spence.

       <p>
        Spence is home to Esilio Wines in Uleybury, which I recently visited alongside the Minister for Trade and Tourism. Esilio are one of the many winemakers that have had a literal world of potential opened up for them by our government. Esilio's owner, Harry Mantzarapis, said himself that our government's support of this vital sector is boosting our economy's morale and confidence. This is indeed a huge win for winemakers, the viticulture industry and those who work closely with it. It's a home truth that is widely recognised across the sector, and that's certainly something to toast.
