       <p>
        Western Australians know that when the bush is doing well then we're all doing well in our state. The coalition government's Building Better Regions Fund has been a highly successful program that has delivered better facilities and economic opportunities across my electorate of Durack, delivering the services and infrastructure our communities need and deserve. It is a huge shame that Labor has decided to axe the BBRF, as it has made a positive difference to the lives of so many families and communities living in rural, regional and remote Australia.

        As the member for Durack, I could not be prouder of the close to 60 planned, under way and completed projects delivered through the BBRF funding—projects such as the Two Rivers Memorial Park in the beautiful town of

        . They officially opened their new visitor rest stop recently, accompanied by a community celebration. The park has been developed on what was the caravan park site prior to the terrible floods back in 2010, which flattened the area. Now it features an amphitheatre, a shaded playground and—Deputy Speaker Claydon, I know you will love this—the first aerial mustering plane in Australia. I could not think of a better use of this space. Thankfully, the park received nearly $2.5 million through the BBRF, making this remote oasis a possibility. I'd like to pass on my huge congratulations to the

        for their vision and for their follow-through. Thanks to everyone who was involved in the wonderful grand opening.
