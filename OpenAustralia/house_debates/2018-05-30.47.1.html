       <p>
        I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the complete lack of activity on the other side when it comes to bringing in legislation that would curtail some practices in the payday-lending sphere that we on this side have been calling for some time. It is amazing to think legislation that was drafted by the government and that has bipartisan support is yet to come into this chamber for a vote. It's not surprising, however, if you think it is now the responsibility of the member for Deakin.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Deakin was in fact quoted in the media last week as saying that the legislation will be progressed this year, with changes applying 12 months after its passage. That is just not good enough from the member opposite. This legislation needs to come into the House as soon as possible, and the member for Deakin needs to explain why it would need a 12-month application process before it came into effect. People in my community need to be protected from the predatory behaviours of some payday lenders. They need to be protected. They need the protection of this legislation, and this member needs to bring it into this chamber so that we can all vote for it.
