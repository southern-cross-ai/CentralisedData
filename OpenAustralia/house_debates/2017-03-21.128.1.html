        This last weekend was a weekend of community fundraising in Dunkley. The sheer number of events that occurred is one of the many factors that make me very proud to be part of our generous community. Mt Eliza

        , for example, were out on Saturday, rattling tins to fundraise for the maintenance and purchase of equipment to protect our local community, a new tanker, amongst other things. We are so lucky to have an active

        in our community, with

        CFA being a brigade entirely made up of volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the same weekend, this same brigade of the Mount Eliza CFA saw members Madison and Dan both shave their heads as part of the World's Greatest Shave to raise funds for leukaemia and blood cancer research. Every day, 31 Australians receive the news that no-one ever wants to hear—that they have leukaemia. Leukaemia or blood cancer more broadly is the third most common cause of cancer death in Australia and, while research is progressing, an Australian life is lost to blood cancer every two hours. To mark that day, I also coloured my hair Liberal blue and yellow but managed to wash it out in time for the start of the sitting week yesterday–after three or four attempts.

        On Saturday evening, I attended a dinner raising funds for Fusion Mornington Peninsula, who bring purpose, love and resilience into the lives of young people at risk.

        for Life was held to support this fantastic organisation, which helps to get young people's lives back on track. It was an honour to be a part of their journey. Fusion is based at the old Balcombe Army barracks where my own father did Army training. It is great that this venue is still being put to such good use.

        The final event I have time to mention is the K163 Kids' Fun Run on Sunday which was jointly run by the

        I congratulate everyone involved with a marathon fundraising effort this last weekend in Dunkley. We have plenty to be proud of as a community. I was also pleased recently to announce $100,000 for the Langwarrin Community Garden at the Langwarrin Community Centre. This is yet another group in our electorate based in Langwarrin, which provides a great community service and fundraising efforts to help the community of Langwarrin and residents in the wider region. Thank you for the opportunity to raise this today. I look forward to raising future Dunkley fundraising events for our wonderful community.
