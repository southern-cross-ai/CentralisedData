       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 3 September 2009 concerning the recently submitted petition regarding Indigenous languages in Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I am pleased to report that a National Indigenous Languages Policy was jointly announced on 9 August 2009 by myself, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The policy confirmed the Australian Governmentâ€™s commitment to keeping Indigenous languages alive and supporting Indigenous Australians to connect with their language and culture.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Importantly, this is the first dedicated national Indigenous languages policy Australia has adopted.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       In collaboration with other Australian Government departments, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts is currently developing a practical plan to implement this policy.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       This will involve consultation with state and territory government agencies and Indigenous languages organisations to ensure the policy will achieve the outcomes sought.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       As part of the broader implementation of the policy, my Department will examine the proposal for a National Indigenous Languages Centre.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       You should also note that the Australian Government is pursing the idea of a national Indigenous Cultural Education and Knowledge Centre arising from the Australia 2020 Summit.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       As a first step, a feasibility study will be undertaken to develop possible models and options for such a centre, for consideration by Government.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government currently supports extensive maintenance and revival of Indigenous languages through the Maintenance of Indigenous Languages and Records Program which is providing $9.3 million in 2009-10 to some 65 projects nationally, involving around 200 languages.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The policy can be found at:
