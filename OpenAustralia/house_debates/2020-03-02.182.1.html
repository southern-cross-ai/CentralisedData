       <p>
        Like so many people in my community of Lindsay, my family and I enjoy spending time on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepean_River" rel="nofollow">
         Nepean River
        </a>
        . Our river has been there for generations for people in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        to enjoy. That's why I fought so hard to secure funding to keep the river healthy so more young families in our community are able to have more time outside, enjoy our natural environment and stay active. I was joined at the Nepean River by the Minister for the Environment,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussan_Ley" rel="nofollow">
         Sussan Ley
        </a>
        , to finalise the $511,000 that was invested in our river's health and native vegetation. Standing on the riverbank to finalise this project, I was proud to be there once again after fighting for this funding last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was at the riverbank again yesterday for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        with people from across Western Sydney, doing our bit to clean up the rubbish in our community and to keep our river beautiful, as we all enjoy it. I talk a lot about our community spirit in Lindsay, and the turnout and enthusiasm we had to clean up our river shows just how strong it is. I want to make sure that our river is at its best when we have Penrith's very own City to Lakes fun run and walk, which I'm currently campaigning for in our community, just like the City to Surf. The Morrison government's responsible budget management means we can fund the projects that are important to local people, like keeping the Nepean River healthy.
