       <p>
        The Migration Amendment (Australia's Engagement in the Pacific and Other Measures) Bill 2023 amends the Migration Act 1958 to establish the legislative power and framework to conduct a ballot—a 'visa pre-application process'—for specified visa programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill is a necessary first step in delivering on the government's commitment to establish the Pacific engagement visa from July 2023, to boost Pacific permanent migration to Australia and build a stronger Pacific family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boosting Pacific permanent migration to Australia is an essential part of the government's plan to build a stronger Pacific family and strengthen Australia's ties with the Pacific.
       </p>
       <p>
        An increase in permanent migration through the new Pacific engagement visa program will boost Australia's people to people links across the Pacific family, and strengthen country-to-country ties.
       </p>
       <p>

        engagement visa will provide opportunities for skills exchange and contribute to Pacific home economies through remittances and investments. It will also support wider mobility within the region and grow Australia's Pacific diaspora.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will provide the government with the legislative framework needed to implement and operate a ballot for the Pacific engagement visa, for eligible nationals of participating Pacific island countries and Timor-Leste.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year, the Pacific engagement visa program will provide up to 3,000 permanent places for citizens of the Pacific and Timor-Leste to settle in Australia as permanent residents. Eligible participants will be randomly selected through a visa pre-application ballot process and then given the opportunity to apply with their dependent family for a permanent Pacific engagement visa.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, Australia does not have a dedicated permanent residency pathway for nationals of Pacific island countries and Timor-Leste. Contingent on the passage of all associated bills, including the Migration (Visa Pre-application Process) Charge Bill 2023, the Pacific engagement visa would be provided for through amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994,to commence in July 2023. The Pacific engagement visa program will be open to nationals of participating Pacific island countries and Timor-Leste who have drawn a place in the visa pre-application process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Places available for skilled migrants under Australia's annual migration program will not be impacted by the introduction of the Pacific engagement visa. To encourage permanent migration from the Pacific, without jeopardising Australia's existing permanent visa pathways, the annual allocation of 3,000 places for the Pacific engagement visa program is in addition to Australia's overall annual permanent migration program intake.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pacific engagement visa holders will be permanent residents and, like other permanent residents in Australia, these visa holders can live, work, and study anywhere in Australia, which will support local economies and contribute to communities throughout our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ballot process could also be used in the future by Australia's other temporary and permanent migration programs to promote equitable and fair access, specifically for those programs where the number of prospective applicants may exceed available places, and where it is otherwise appropriate to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill, together with the Migration (Visa Pre-application Process) Charge Bill 2023 and the anticipated permanent Pacific engagement visa will deliver on the government's commitment to secure our region and build a stronger Pacific family.
       </p>
       <p>
        These reforms demonstrate to the Australian community, and to our Pacific family, that stronger Pacific partnerships focused on shared needs and priorities are in Australia's national interest, and support stability, prosperity and security in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
