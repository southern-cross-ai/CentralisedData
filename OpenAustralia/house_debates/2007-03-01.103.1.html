       <p>
        I rise this morning to speak on renewable energy, a matter of extreme importance both nationally and internationally. The Howard government’s programs and policies have directly supported or generated investment in the renewable energy industry sector in excess of some $3.5 billion. Currently, the Australian government has provided $52 million to 25 innovative projects through the REDI program and has committed over $1 billion to low emission and renewable energy research and projects, thus stimulating billions of dollars more in private sector investment.

        Australia has produced some of the world’s very best renewable energy technology. I would like to concentrate on wind energy in particular, which is a clean energy source that offers an environmentally sustainable solution in supporting Australia’s future energy requirements. The Australian wind energy industry currently offsets some 2.8 million tonnes of CO per year, the equivalent of taking some 650,000 cars off the road. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        has estimated that the wind turbine market is expected to grow by 20 per cent per annum over the next five years, and, in light of additional responses to climate change, this growth could potentially increase by as much as 50 per cent. Figures released by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Wind_Energy_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Global Wind Energy Council
        </a>
        show that in 2006 the total value of new wind energy generating equipment reached $
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

        23 billion. The Australian wind energy industry experienced significant growth in 2005, almost doubling the industry’s 2004 capacity. Australia has approximately 542 turbines operating across the country, with an average rated capacity of 1.75 megawatts. By the end of 2006, Australia’s installed capacity is expected to represent a total capital investment of some $1.4 billion.

        I turn to my home state of Tasmania, which is a state that is uniquely placed to respond to the demands of clean and green energy. Particular strengths that cannot be easily duplicated include some of the world’s best wind resources, major investment already underway in wind energy, a clean green reputation and local companies with relevant specialist skills. Tasmania is a leader in renewable energy generation in Australia, with over 90 per cent of the state’s electricity sourced from renewable hydro-electricity and with a company established in 2005 between

        Roaring 40s operate the Woolnorth wind farm on the far north-west tip of Tasmania, where the site recorded the cleanest air in the world. In 2004, Hydro Tasmania signed a 10-year $90 million Australian contract with

        has been a beneficiary of wind generation since 1988 and they have a vision to be self-sufficient in renewable zero emission energy by combining wind, wave and solar power. It is important that we continue to support such initiatives.
