       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 4) 2013-2014, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014, which I introduced earlier, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014, are the additional estimates appropriation bills for this financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill seeks further approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just over $3.2 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline the major items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        would receive just under $2.2 billion once this bill commences as an act. This is primarily to administer official development assistance programs which moved to the department from AusAID, which was abolished on 1 November 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection would be provided with almost $400 million for offshore asylum seeker management, including $180 million in capital funding announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This implements the government's policy commitment to process illegal maritime arrivals offshore.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, this bill would provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        with just over $235 million, reflecting three matters. Those are the supplementation for foreign exchange movements, expenditure brought forward into 2013-14 from the forward estimates, and the re-appropriation of amounts between appropriation acts to better align with Defence's current work programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fourth, the bill provides just over $3.3 million for payments to local government for the Liveable Cities Program that is administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. Whilst this program has been terminated, these payments represent the final amounts due. As outlined in schedule 1 of the bill, the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development is responsible for determining the relevant conditions and payments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill and the portfolio additional estimates statements tabled in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
       </p>
