        My question is for the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, it has been reported today that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
         Julian Assange
        </a>
        has left the United Kingdom and is now en route to a United States territory. There are reports that, after 14 years, his legal proceedings may soon be resolved. Prime Minister, is Julian Assange finally coming home?

         I thank the member for Kooyong for her question and for her ongoing interest in this issue. Members on this side of the House, some of the members on the opposite side of the House and the crossbenchers—including the member for Kooyong and the member for Clark in particular—have had a long-term association with this issue.

         The government is certainly aware that Australian citizen Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
          Julian Assange
         </a>
         has legal proceedings scheduled in the United States. While this is a welcome development, we recognise that these proceedings are crucial and delicate. Given these proceedings are ongoing, it isn't appropriate to provide further detailed comment. I will say, though, that the Australian government has continued to provide consular assistance to Mr Assange through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         high commissioner,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Stephen Smith
         </a>
         , who travelled with Mr Assange when he left the United Kingdom, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         ambassador

          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         , who is also providing important assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've been very clear, as the Labor leader in opposition but also as Prime Minister, that, regardless of the views people have about Mr Assange's activities, the case has dragged on for too long. There is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration, and we want him brought home to Australia. We have engaged and advocated Australia's interests using all appropriate channels to support a positive outcome, and I have done that since very early on in my prime ministership. I will have more to say when these legal proceedings have concluded, which I hope will be very soon, and I will report, as appropriate, at that time.
