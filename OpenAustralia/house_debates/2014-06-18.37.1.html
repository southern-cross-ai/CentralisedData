        According to Homelessness Australia, over 100,000 people are currently homeless in Australia. Most concerning to me is that thousands of those people are children. Homelessness is a scourge that both civil society and we as legislators have a responsibility and a duty to address. The best way government can reduce homelessness is by putting in place the right framework to educate our youth and to provide them with opportunities. It is also about putting in place a framework that will allow the economy to grow and prosper and, in turn, create jobs—and it is about putting the right framework in place to support those people in need. However, no matter how well we do at all of this, there will sometimes be those who find themselves in vulnerable positions through no fault of their own—it could be through family breakdown, domestic violence, or mental illness. That is why organisations such as St Vincent de Paul Society are so critical in our society. These volunteer, not-for-profit organisations help some of the most needy and most vulnerable.

        This Thursday night, I will be participating in the Vinnies
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Sleepout. This will be the third year that I have taken part. First held in 2008, it is a wonderful initiative which has raised more than $13 million for people who are suffering from homelessness and issues around poverty, providing education programs, recreation activities and extensive information and referral services. I urge those in this place to support this great cause by supporting those who are taking part in the Vinnies CEO Sleepout.
