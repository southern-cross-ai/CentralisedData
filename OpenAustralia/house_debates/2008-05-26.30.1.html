        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree that even if the arguments in favour of FuelWatch had some validity, working families such as those in

         On the question of fuel, we need to embrace a range of policies. The Assistant Treasurer before outlined the undertakings we gave prior to the last election on enhancing competition in the fuel industry and our implementation of those. And to those we have added our new policy in relation to FuelWatch. On the FuelWatch question, the honourable member refers to Sydney in particular.

           FuelWatch will put motorists—not the oil companies—back in charge … It will put an end the common frustration for motorists of driving past a petrol station only to find when they return hours later the price has jumped by ten cents a litre.

              I find that remarkable from the Manager for Opposition Business, who said, I think, that this policy was copying Liberal policy. Is that what he was saying? And we have just had them say they are going to block this policy in the Senate! I can make neither head nor tail of where the Liberal Party stand on this matter, or any other matter on fuel policy. Divided on excise, now divided on FuelWatch. It will be remarkable to see what unfolds in the Senate.

                <p>
                 Again I return to the question asked by the honourable member, quoting the Liberal opposition fair trading spokesman in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                  New South Wales
                 </a>
                 , the state from which she comes. The spokesman said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 [Labor] has shown leadership ... we think it’s good news for motorists and we’re quite happy to come out and congratulate the federal Labor government for doing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If the Liberal Party cannot sort itself out within Canberra on where it stands on excise, it certainly cannot sort itself out nationally about where it stands on FuelWatch. I find it remarkable that those opposite could hold open the possibility of this measure being blocked in the Senate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The bottom line is that there is no silver bullet when it comes to petrol. We all believe that we need to help working families under financial pressure to the greatest extent we can in dealing with the pressures on the family budget, but we certainly do not have the view that those opposite had barely five or six months ago that working families have never been better off. We did not make an undertaking to the Australian people that interest rates would be kept at record lows. What we have said quite consistently is that we need to enhance what we can by way of competition policy. One statement after another the member for Higgins criticised us for putting forward those policies in opposition, saying that they were not sufficiently prescriptive on the future. Check the member for Higgins’s statements on this in his transcripts. So I say to the honourable member that this will help at the margins. We do not wish to understate it and we do not wish to overstate it: it will help at the margins. But we think in terms of the experience of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Western Australia
                 </a>
                 it is the right way forward. Of course there will be conflicting advice on these questions, there will be conflicting evidence, there will be conflicting points of view. We, however, believe this is the right way forward.

                   If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition contests this policy, which is what she is doing, I presume she is saying the same directly and publicly to the state Liberal leadership in her own state of
