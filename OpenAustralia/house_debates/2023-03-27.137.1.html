       <p>
        To be sent to this place to represent our communities is an immense privilege. It's not lost on me the gravity of the responsibility we have here in this place. We're trusted to make decisions of significance for our communities and for our nation. We are trusted to make difficult decisions, decisions that not everyone will agree with. In a democracy we know that it is impossible to get 100 per cent agreement all the time, so it is a good thing that we not only allow but welcome a diversity of views across our nation and in this place as well. It is the job of government to make the tough decisions and be accountable for them. That's the job. But it doesn't seem to be a responsibility some members of this place take seriously enough. I'm talking about members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greens_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Greens Party
        </a>
        , who scurried out on the recent vote on the Albanese Labor government's $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. We know the opposition opposed. They took that position. Fine. We don't agree with you, but the Greens scurried out this.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the largest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade, a fund which will deliver the government's commitment of 30,000 new social and affordable homes in its first five years, including: $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness; $30 million to build housing and to fund specialist services for veterans who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness; $200 million for the repair, maintenance and improvement of housing in remote and Indigenous communities. That's what we were voting on. Those opposite opposed all of that. Those over there on the crossbench, the minor party, ran out. They didn't vote for it. They didn't vote against it. They didn't have the guts to vote at all. That is just not good enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are sent here by our communities to represent them and their views, but if you can't even make a decision on critical investment in social and affordable housing, what are you here for? They'll come in here day in day out shouting, waving their hands, having a crack during the debate. That's fine. That's part of the cut and thrust of politics, criticising the government. But we are actually getting on with the job. It is a government that is actually making the tough calls in the interests of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We won't always get everything 100 per cent right but we will always take a principled position, front up, justify it and make our case. But what possible justification is there for just failing to do your job entirely—'Oh, we don't have a position, Mr Speaker.' I think that's not good enough. It is not good enough for the thousands of Australians in need of social and affordable housing. It is not good enough for the renters and the mortgage holders of Australia dealing with rising costs. They all know how the make the tough decisions; they are making them every day. They have an opposition in the Liberal and National parties, who are opposing relief for them. Those opposite opposed relief on energy bills as well last December—disgracefully. They are opposing the affordable and social housing fund, and we have a crossbench or minor party that is not even showing up to make that tough decision or to support that bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are decisions that Australians are making everyday to balance their budget, to meet their rental or mortgage payments. These are the people who we represent and the people who we have to make decisions for. There is still hope.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        political party can still rectify their position by voting for the Housing Australia Future Fund in the Senate. Let's hope they see the light. I encourage all the crossbenchers and members of the Senate to support this very important bill. We are not going to get much hope from over there, from the opposition. They have made their position very clear; they just oppose. It is no, no, no to everything. We could have the best possible bill and law put forward in this place and they would still say no. It wouldn't matter. That's just what they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a secure, ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable housing over the long term. Standing in the way of that legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund means standing in the way of 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes. It means standing in the way of $30 million for housing and services for veterans experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of homelessness. It means standing in the way of $200 million for repair and maintenance of housing. It means standing in the way of $100 million for crisis and transitional housing for women and children.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I encourage all of those on the crossbench and opposite to support the Albanese Labor government in delivering this once-in-a-generation investment that will change the lives of thousands of Australians.
