         Brisbane Water
        </a>
        is the beating heart of Robertson. Our towns, our villages, snake along this body of water, and our history owes much to the prosperity it has provided over many years. No matter where you are in Robertson, you are sure to have a view of this waterway or be only a short drive away. Brisbane Water influences the lifestyles that we enjoy in Robertson. Its waterways provide ideal environments for activities like sailing, kayaking, swimming or simply enjoying a peaceful walk along the water's edge. I personally enjoy walking this beautiful area, taking in the natural beauty and serenity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The unique and charming coastal villages that surround Brisbane Water are complemented by friendly and community-minded people, whom I am very honoured to represent. The villages of Yattalunga, Saratoga and Davistown, also referred to as the three villages, are especially committed to ensuring their suburbs are well looked after. These villages are home to the 3 Villages Community Group, which is an assembly of passionate residents that advocate on behalf of the wider community that calls these three suburbs home. I recently met with the 3 Villages Community Group to learn more about what they would like for their communities and how I can provide my support for their causes. It was instructive to listen to them talk about projects that they have been a part of, including the upgrades to Jirramba Reserve playground in Saratoga and the work that they are now involved with to upgrade the Lynton Street Public Wharf and associated car parking.

        It is also very important to note that the group compose and publish a monthly newsletter that is distributed by volunteers to every household in the three-villages area. It is an outstanding community service that must be applauded. I look forward to supporting and working with the 3 Villages Community Group. My special thanks and appreciation go to Taia Sansom, Monique Roy, Stephanie Blower and all the volunteers that help contribute to making the 3 Villages Community Group an effective and successful residents organisation on the
