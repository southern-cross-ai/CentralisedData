        , and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with this report.

        Leave granted.

       <p>
        This is the committee's third report of 2014, addressing the referral made in December 2013 for the development and construction of housing for Defence at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Tindal" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Tindal
        </a>
        , Northern Territory. The referral from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Housing Australia
        </a>
        initially proposed construction of 50 tropically designed dwellings and associated support and infrastructure at RAAF Base Tindal at a cost of $89.4 million. The committee visited RAAF Base Tindal and held hearings in Katherine in late January. The committee subsequently sought additional information on the project from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHA" rel="nofollow">
         DHA
        </a>
        because it was not satisfied that the project cost represented value for money. The committee's concerns were outlined to DHA, and DHA subsequently submitted an amended proposal for 50 tropically designed houses to be built at RAAF Base Tindal at a cost of $47.15 million. At the second public and in camera hearing held in Canberra in April, the committee examined the amended proposal and was satisfied that the project, as amended, has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceeds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report I am tabling today details how DHA was able to make such substantial savings while still delivering 50 houses of high quality which are appropriate for the location. The committee commends Defence Housing Australia for working with it in a cooperative and timely manner to achieve a satisfactory outcome. I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to this inquiry, and on behalf of the committee I would also like to thank the secretariat for their work in relation to this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.
