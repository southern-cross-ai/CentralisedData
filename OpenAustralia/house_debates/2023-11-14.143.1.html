        Last month I visited 97.9
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        , Melton's own community radio station. Students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staughton_College" rel="nofollow">
         Staughton College
        </a>
        hosted the
        <i>
         Homework Club
        </i>
        . Started eight years ago, the
        <i>
         Homework Club
        </i>
        is on the air every Thursday from 4 to 6 pm. It has a team of 28 dedicated volunteers led by Staughton College staff member and all-round legend Will Cachia. It was wonderful to chat with three amazing student hosts Maddy, Lily and Karma. They asked the tough questions about our local community as well as our work here in the parliament. While I acknowledged that it could be a bellicose environment at times, I assured them that parliamentary debate was critical to having a strong contest of ideas in our democracy. The hosts' professionalism and skill were incredibly impressive and a testament to a fantastic program run by Will.

        Melton community radio has proven to be an invaluable community service since it was established almost 40 years ago. It not only gives kids like Maddy, Lily and Karma the opportunity to develop their broadcasting skills but also provides important community programming, with local community news and talkback, culturally and linguistically diverse programming, and local sports, including coverage of the local Ballarat football league games. Tune in to 97.9 FM and stay connected with our community in Melton. Thanks for your work, gang.

        I recently had the privilege of visiting the Grant Street Medical Centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_Marsh" rel="nofollow">
         Bacchus Marsh
        </a>
        after it received funding through our Strengthening Medicare
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        Grants Program. Twenty-eight GP clinics right across Hawke, from Sunbury to Hillside and Melton to Ballan, will receive a share of the $220 million fund that will ensure that local clinics have the resources they need to care for our community. The money will enhance digital health capability, upgrade infection prevention and control, and help achieve and maintain accreditation. This is just one part of the Albanese Labor government's plan to strengthen Medicare, including in my electorate of Hawke.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the Sunbury urgent care clinic opened earlier this year, its opening hours have also been extended. Now open 14 hours a day, seven days a week, the clinic can see more patients more often, and they're all fully bulk-billed. This won't just make it easier for locals to get the care they need for urgent but non-life-threatening injuries and illness; it will also ease the pressure on our hospital emergency rooms. The Sunbury urgent care clinic has already treated 3,500 patients and is ensuring that locals can get the care they need closer to home without spending a dime. The Albanese Labor government is making sure that your healthcare bills are paid by your Medicare card and not your credit card. We'll continue to fight to make sure that locals, from Sunbury and Ballan to Bacchus Marsh and Melton, get the health care they need.
