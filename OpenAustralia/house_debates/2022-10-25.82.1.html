         I want to thank the member for Bendigo, who is experiencing floods in her own region, for the work she's done with her community. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Minister Murray Watt for the work that he has done since entering government. We've had multiple natural disasters and we've had agricultural issues, and his swift response in mobilising the ADF and getting payments out so quickly should be congratulated. As a former mayor who experienced nine declared natural disasters in four years, I'm very aware of the important role that local governments play in supporting their communities through disaster but also into recovery. We're thinking of all those communities, particularly those in and around Lismore, who have felt multiple floods on numerous occasions already this year. We know you're fatigued, and we know it takes a toll on your communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The former government stood on the hose of disaster relief payments. They slowed financial assistance to local government down to a trickle, especially when local governments were struggling to help their communities through very difficult times. The Albanese government is providing financial help—

More than 100 local government areas have been activated for the disaster recovery allowance since 14 September, and a further 30 local government areas have been activated for the Australian government disaster recovery payment. I have called numerous mayors in flood affected areas to let them know the Albanese government stands ready to help.

               There are evacuation orders in place for lower North Lismore, with multiple emergency warnings across
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               . My message is simply: please listen to the authorities. Heed their warnings and advice. We are working closely with state and territory governments to support those impacted local government areas and their communities to provide practical and timely on-ground assistance. People in local government areas affected by these floods can access disaster assistance payments through Services Australia. We currently have a bill before parliament that will transform the former government's failed Emergency Response Fund into a dedicated, ongoing source of funding for natural disaster resilience and risk reduction initiatives. Not only is it important to be there for communities at the time of disasters; it's important to be there to assist them to prepare for what's coming in the future, and that is what the Albanese Labor government is doing.
