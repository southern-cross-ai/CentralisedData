         Australia Day
        </a>
        is truly a time that we reflect on the wonderful things that make us Australians. As the member for Lindsay, I am incredibly proud of the Lindsay residents and the residents of the Penrith local government area that were recognised for their longstanding contributions to our city. One of the people I was really inspired to see recognised with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was John Farragher. Many people know John's story as a man who had an accident playing rugby league which has seen him live his life in a wheelchair. For all of my life I remember seeing John Farragher's face every time I walk into Panthers. He is the smile that greets you and every other person as they come through the doors. John Farragher has seen adversity in his life, but he is one of possibly the most inspirational people I have ever met. He is a true blessing to our city and a wonderful choice for an OAM.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another wonderful citizen who was recognised was Norma Thorburn. Norma is a wonderful citizen, passionate about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys
        </a>
        region and preserving its history. St Marys has such a proud history. Werrington, which sits between Penrith and St Marys, was in fact the home of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Henry_Parkes" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Henry Parkes

        . Our town has done so much.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dodds_McCormick" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dodds McCormick
        </a>
        was a St Marys schoolteacher. In fact, Peter Dodds McCormick wrote our national anthem. These are things that come from St Marys. These are things that are home to the people of Lindsay. Norma is absolutely passionate that our children understand the pride that we have in our region, that the father of our Constitution lived in our area and people like Peter Dodds McCormick lived there and taught St Marys schoolchildren.

        Then there is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Watson" rel="nofollow">
         Rodney Watson
        </a>
        . Rodney, lives in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Clair" rel="nofollow">
         St Clair
        </a>
        , which is in McMahon but still part of Penrith. Rodney has devoted his life to Penrith District Netball. Penrith District Netball is one of the biggest netball organisations in Australia. He is passionate about seeing netball go above and beyond. Netball is one of the largest, if not the largest, participation sports in our country. It is wonderful for a region that has challenges with obesity and diabetes to have so many people participate in sport. Rodney has seen himself elevated to state and national roles. He is an incredible ambassador for netball. He is a wonderful advocate for our community. Once again, a very worthy recipient.

        received awards for their community work along a range of organisations. Chris has spent 37 years in Rotary, where he helped build Hope Cottage. He was a tennis coach, part of the Nepean Medical Research Foundation and a foundation member of the local

        . David Trist is now 90. He has been part of Nepean Legacy since 1960. Also, he was in possession of a Japanese flag which was captured during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . In recent years he had the flag returned to the Japanese village by my good friend,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Mayor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Penrith, Ross Fowler. Townsfolk cried as they saw the symbolism of the sacred flag being returned to the monastery. Dr Jay Chandra, a local optometrist in Penrith, was recognised for his Fiji Eye Project in 2005. So many people were recognised. I am truly honoured to represent a region that has contributed so much to our wonderful country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally in Penrith we also saw Citizen of the Year awarded to my good friend, Wayne Wilmington. Wayne and his wife, Ann, have done so much with regard to the Relay for Life, but also for the Music for Life Foundation, where they have raised money for medical research. They have raised money to help so many others. Wayne is also an

        , Wayne, who is a Luddenham local, has been crucial in helping the community in Luddenham advocate for what they need to see road upgrades for the Northern Road, which will require some degree of land acquisition. Wayne is a truly wonderful recipient to be the Penrith Citizen of the Year. I would like to commend all my local citizens and thank them for their work.
