       <p>
        I rise to update the House on the exciting progress of two really important intersection projects in my electorate—those at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Cross Road
        </a>
        and Fullarton Road, and at Fullarton Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Osmond_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Osmond Road
        </a>
        . Both were funded by the previous government as part of our congestion-busting initiatives. I'm excited to say that both are very close to completion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cross Road-Fullarton Road project is now well through the major realignment surface works. I appreciate all the patient residents who have had to deal with some of the restrictions on that intersections over the last couple of weeks. It's for an important long-term benefit, and I know everyone in that corner of my electorate understands that and is excited about that coming to fruition in the coming weeks. It's been a long and important project that we've spent nearly 2½ years on, from the announcement of that funding in the 2019 budget to the significant consultation process. I'm very excited that we're close to that being completed and, equally, just down the road, to the Glen Osmond Road-Fullarton Road intersection upgrade being completed. That's a little further behind Cross Road-Fullarton Road, but it's coming along and surface works are progressing.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're going to see a transformation of the traffic-carrying capability of Fullarton Road. It will benefit people well beyond my electorate of Sturt. I'm very proud of that investment and that legacy of our government in busting congestion in the eastern suburbs.
