       <p>
        I would like to pay my respects to two people in Isaacs who have recently died. The first is Ranka Cotic, who was a member of the Chelsea branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        . Ranka was 74 years old and she died a week or so ago. Ranka lost her husband, Tom, a few years ago and I do not think she ever really quite recovered from that loss. Ranka had not been able to physically contribute to Labor Party politics in recent years but she was a true, loyal and very strong supporter of the Labor Party, and all that we stand for, for many years. I offer my condolences to the Cotic family.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second person is Jim Strachan, who was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Noble Park
        </a>
        branch of the Labor Party. Jim joined the party in 1941 and I am assuming he was 14 years old, although I suspect he might have been just 13 years old, at the time. He became a life member of the party many years ago. He was a very strong and loyal supporter of the party for very many years. He had not enjoyed good health for some time, but he still attended branch meetings as recently as earlier this year. I would like to pass on my condolences to Jimâ€™s wife, Pat, and to his family.
