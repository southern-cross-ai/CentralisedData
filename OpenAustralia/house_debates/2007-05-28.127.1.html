        I rise to draw the attention of the House to the running this month of the Annual Combined
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Service Clubs
        </a>
        ’ Dinner in Gawler. The reason I bring this to the attention of the House is that so often we hear that we do not get cooperation in communities and that we do not see communities really looking outside of themselves. But the service clubs in Wakefield are made up of a fantastic group of people. In Gawler in particular this annual event is something to be applauded and it should be replicated around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        What happens is that once a year all of the service clubs come together for a dinner where they can share information about the programs they are running, the activities they are doing, needs they have and opportunities that arise so that they can be more effective by working together. The Country Women’s Association hosted this year’s dinner. Linda Bertram as the president welcomed us to the evening and invited each of the clubs to have a representative, either their president or another member, give a report about the club’s membership and the activities that were undertaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thing that really struck me was that, whilst we tend to think of, say, your typical
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        project as being perhaps a shelter at a park or something, what I am seeing through the service clubs in Wakefield, particularly the ones in Gawler, is a real focus on communities. We are seeing a real outreach to communities, not just locally but internationally, that are worse off than our own. There is a real intention to reach out and help them, from Apex and its help for the Westmead Craniofacial Clinic activities through to the local Lions Club, who have restored the train at the Gawler railway station, particularly through their use of the Work for the Dole scheme, which has seen a number of people come and be involved in the restoration of the building environs and the train—and the creation of a real centrepiece for the Gawler railway station.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is the Gawler View Club, and Pauline LaRoche spoke of the many women involved in that locally as well as on a broader basis, and their involvement with the Smith Family—again, looking to support young people and families not as well off as ours.

        spoke on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Gawler, which has very generously made me an honorary member. We heard about Alison Russell and Zonta, which is involved in advancing the status of women around the world in areas such as health and through combating things like trafficking. Interestingly, people like Naomi Arnold have been involved in Zonta not just at the local level but also at an international level. That says a lot for the quality of people in our community who step up to the mark and are prepared to take on leadership roles within these service groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Martin Monument spoke on behalf of the Rotary Club of Gawler Light. I have been very pleased to be involved in some of the activities that this Rotary Club has run, such as the mental health forum in Gawler, where they were endeavouring to bring together people who have an interest in mental health, people who are engaged in supporting people with mental health issues and people who suffer from mental health issues, to bring an awareness of the help that can be provided and of gaps in services that we need to fill. They also have an active role in supporting the Gawler Health Service, as well as things like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Monika Klopas spoke on behalf of the Gawler Para branch of Apex and highlighted the 12 years that they have been running the Christmas light display along the riverbank. She bemoaned the fact that, with a couple of members moving on, their membership is now quite small; but, typical of the function that evening, one of the other service clubs offered to come on board and actually take over that role to make sure that the Christmas light display, which is so welcomed by the families of Gawler, continues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bruce Townsend spoke on behalf of the Kiwanis and highlighted the fact that, whilst there is much need in the world, the Kiwanis approach is to change the world one child and one community at a time, and he gave examples of the things that they are doing to support people in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, we heard about the work of the Country Women’s Association in providing baby packs to needy mums, emergency accommodation to families in need and even reaching out to people like the Fiji Cancer Society through the provision of things like sewing machines. All this just brings into sharp focus the outward-looking nature and community-mindedness of these people in Gawler, and on behalf of all Australians I thank them for the time and effort which they volunteer.
