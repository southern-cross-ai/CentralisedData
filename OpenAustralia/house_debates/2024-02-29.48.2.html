         I agree with all of the sentiments expressed by the member for Kennedy, and I'll add one, which is that he has played an extraordinary role in representing his community over projects like CopperString and over projects around Hughenden.
        </p>
        <p>
         I visited the electorate of the member for Kennedy to look at what are called the Big Kennedy and Little Kennedy wind farm projects and to look at the solar project driven with hydro out of an old goldmine, as well, that's been so extraordinarily successful. I even braved the Hughenden pub with the member for Kennedy, to meet with all of the locals, and to have a community meeting. I risked my life by sitting in the wrong seat of someone who was seven foot eight tall.

         say to the member for Kennedy that I agree with him. I have a longstanding interest, as well, in the Hughenden Irrigation Scheme. It is a proposal that's being developed. The Minister for the Environment and Water, the brilliant

         , is happy to meet with stakeholders and the Queensland government to discuss the irrigation needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         This project would provide around 11,000 hectares of irrigated agricultural area. The Queensland government has written to ask us to consider funding for preconstruction activities, which we have now delivered. I understand that the Queensland government has recently announced a review of the gulf water plan. My government will continue to work constructively with the Queensland government and the member for Kennedy to invest in water infrastructure that considers the region as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are investing in Queensland water infrastructure projects:

         near Bundy in Queensland, Cairns Water Security, the Mount Morgan Water Supply Pipeline Project, strategic planning for improving water security, additional funding between Big Rocks Weir and groundwater improvement, and water efficiency in the Lower Burdekin.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are investing in water infrastructure, which is so important, particularly with the changing climate. What we're seeing is floods but then droughts, often in the same regions as well. We need to make sure that we have adaptation going forward, as well. That's something understood by the member for Kennedy, and I look forward to working with him to promote further investment into Queensland water infrastructure.
