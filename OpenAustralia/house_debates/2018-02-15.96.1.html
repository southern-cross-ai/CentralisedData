        <p>
         Thank you to the honourable member, who has been a relentless advocate for protecting Australians online in whatever they might do. She knows, as we do on this side of the House, that no government has done more than this one to protect Australians online. We know that with rapidly evolving technology Australians are facing risks in their homes, on their phones, in their schoolyards, in their workplaces, in businesses small and large and from an ever-increasing range of threats: threats from government, threats from criminal networks, threats from activists and threats from cyberbullies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just in the last few months we've seen extraordinary attacks on small businesses and large in this country through ransomware, where code is dropped onto the systems of businesses. They are shut down until they hand over money to criminals. That's why, in anticipation of this and in response to it, in April 2016 the Prime Minister and the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         announced the government's Cyber Security Strategy. Never has there been such a coordinated, coherent response to this issue. It included $36 million to our law enforcement and criminal intelligence agencies to attack cybercrimeâ€”to make sure cybercriminals are held to account and that they can't live in a fog of excuses. It makes sure that we are forming global networks to solve global problems with global solutions against local attacks. And, of course, it has a strong focus on forming partnerships across the private and public sectors to ensure we can detect, deter and respond to these attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are risks to this strategy. The biggest risk, as in so many other areas, is a government that can't make ends meet. If we want evidence of this we need look back no further than May 2012, that fateful night when the member for Lilley announced the four surpluses that were never to be delivered. Hidden in that budget was a cut of $1.2 billion to critical
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
          IT
         </a>
         projects, including projects that were protecting Australians against cyberthreats. As a government that makes ends meet, the coalition can be trusted to deliver a strong and coordinated cybersecurity strategy for this nation.
