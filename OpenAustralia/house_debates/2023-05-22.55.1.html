       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary Australian, Rex Hall AFSM, who was honoured last week with life membership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        Volunteer Firefighters Museum. This honour follows Rex being awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS" rel="nofollow">
         CFS
        </a>
        chief officer's commendation in January of this year, as only the second person in the agency to receive that acknowledgement. Late last year Rex was also recognised for 60 years of service to the Naracoorte Group CFS. I've worked with Rex in recent years to help secure federal government funding for the SA Volunteer Firefighters Museum, which includes, amongst other things, a memorial to fallen
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n volunteer firefighters, who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The museum was first conceived over 20 years ago, and Rex has led its development from a fledgling idea to becoming a memorial and museum site. His commitment to preserving the culture and history of volunteer firefighting in South Australia has seen him published four times over his 20 years of research. Rex, who has held the position of chairperson on the museum committee since its inception, didn't stand for re-election this term due to his ailing health. Last week was National Volunteer Week, and I can't think of a more dedicated, passionate volunteer within my community of Barker. From receiving the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        in 1994 to earning these recent accolades, Rex deserves recognition for his outstanding commitment to community service.
