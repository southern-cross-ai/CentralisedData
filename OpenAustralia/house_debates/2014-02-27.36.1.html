       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge the efforts of Mr Andy Nguyen and the committee of the Saigon welcoming arch in my electorate of Gellibrand. One thing that makes Australia so special is its acceptance and appreciation of other cultures. In recognition of this there is currently a community-led project underway in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Saigon" rel="nofollow">
         Little Saigon
        </a>
        in Footscray to build a symbolic welcoming arch recognising and celebrating 40 years of Vietnamese settlement in my community. The efforts of Mr Andy Nguyen must be recognised here, as proposals for a welcoming arch have existed since the 1980s. Without his hard work and determination this project would not be where it is today. However, while progress is being made on the welcoming arch project, it is not by any means a done deal.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a great deal of community support for this project through fundraisers and voluntary donations in my community, but the support of other levels of government is still needed to make the project a reality. My local council has already committed to giving $350,000 to the project but further grants at other levels of government are needed. While donations of all amounts for the project are appreciated, the committee and the Maribyrnong City Council are planning to engrave the names of donors who contribute $5,000 and over on a brick of honour to be laid around the arch. I am proud to say that I will be personally acquiring such a brick of honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Little Saigon welcoming arch will serve as a permanent testament to the pride we take as Australians in our inclusivity and diversity. I strongly encourage any Australian who is proud of our rich cultural heritage to donate any amount they can spare to such a worthy cause.
