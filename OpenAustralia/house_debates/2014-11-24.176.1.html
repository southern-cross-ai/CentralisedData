       <p>
        Today I pay tribute to Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Such" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Such
        </a>
        , who died on 11 October whilst in office as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n parliament after a lengthy period of poor health. Bob Such was the independent member for Fisher, having first been elected to local government in the early 1980s and then as a Liberal member to state parliament in 1989, where he served as a minister in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Brown" rel="nofollow">

        government from 1993 onwards. He became an independent MP in 2000 and was re-elected as an independent in all subsequent elections.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was a genuinely decent politician who regularly took on the bureaucracy or the government of the day in defence of people who were unfairly treated by nonsensical government policies or laws. He was also a true independent who put the interests of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        s or common sense first when taking on a political issue. Even though his health had been up and down for several years, Bob soldiered on in public life, making himself very well known throughout South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my sincere condolences to Bob's wife, Lyn, his sons, Derek, Adrian and Darren, and his other family members, who I know will feel the loss the most but who can also be proud of Bob's political legacy. South Australia has lost a good, honest community representative and he will be missed.
