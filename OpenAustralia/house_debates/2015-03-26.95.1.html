       <p>
        Today is quite a sad day for the chamber because it is the last day for Joanne Towner, Clerk Assistant (Table). She will be retiring before the House resumes for the budget sittings. I would just like to give you the background of Joanne before we wish her every happiness in her retirement and say how much we will miss her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joanne commenced with the Department of the House of Representatives in July 1987, transferring from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        to work with the secretariat of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. After later promotion, Joanne performed very capably as the secretary of the joint committees, as well as other committees, and as Director, Chamber Research Office. She has worked as Clerk Assistant since 2009, undertaking the roles of Clerk Assistant (Committees) and, most recently, Clerk Assistant (Table). Joanne has had a very successful career with the parliament and embodies the very best characteristics of the clerks who serve this House. She enjoys the total confidence of members and of me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honourable members: Hear, hear!
       </p>
       <p>
        She is highly regarded by the staff of the department. It is fair to say that we are all very sorry that she has chosen to commence her retirement. Nevertheless, we wish her and her husband, Ed, all the very best with her retirement, and indeed with her son, as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Catherine Cornish, a longstanding officer of the House, has been selected to replace Joanne. I wish Catherine all the very best in her new role, as I am sure each and every member of the House does.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joanne, we wish you every happiness in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honourable members: Hear, hear!
