        I want to remark upon some wonderful individuals in my electorate. I think we would all agree that it is important to encourage and support young people who demonstrate a commitment to their communities and to active public leadership. Now in its second year, the Gorton Young Leaders Awards are my way of recognising local young people who have shown an exceptional commitment to public service, specifically through involvement in voluntary work, student leadership or community service.

        I am extremely pleased to inform the House that the electorate of Gorton has again produced a number of outstanding young leaders. The achievements of these leaders were diverse, ranging from work with local parish communities, volunteer work for the

        Last week I had the great pleasure and privilege to meet with these young leaders, their parents and college representatives at a morning tea that I convened in my electorate office in Keilor. It was a very successful and well attended event. I know that the winners enjoyed themselves. They conveyed that to me on the day. I look forward to charting the progress of these young leaders in the years ahead. Indeed, they are exemplary role models for not only the western suburbs of Melbourne but the country at large. The achievements of these young leaders reflect highly not only on each individual concerned but also on their parents, schools and greater communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure the House will join me in congratulating them on their efforts and wishing them every success going into the future.
