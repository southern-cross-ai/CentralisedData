        In the last year, more than 400 Curtin constituents have contacted me about their concerns regarding the expansion of Woodside's North West Shelf gas processing plant at the Burrup Hub in the north-west of WA, and the related development of the Browse Basin. Woodside is planning to extend this project through to 2070. This has far-reaching consequences. My constituents have three different types of concerns in relation to this. Firstly, this project has significant environmental impact. The Browse Basin project involves drilling 54 wells in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Reef
        </a>
        , a sanctuary for nesting sea turtles, pygmy and blue whales, dugong, and many other protected species of marine life. These species are directly impacted by drilling, dredging, pollution and any oil spills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, if it continues to 2070, the emissions from the production and use of the gas from this processing facility are about the same as Australia's entire emissions budget from 2030 onwards. This single project will have a global impact on our ability to decarbonise in time. But, believe it or not, the climate impacts of projects like this don't have to be considered in the approvals process. Climate change is the biggest threat to national security, the biggest threat to future prosperity and the biggest threat to a liveable planet, but our laws say it's not relevant to environmental approval processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, the Burrup Hub is right next to Murujuga, which contains more than a million rock art petroglyphs dating back 50,000 years, including depictions of extinct animals and some of the earliest known images of the human face. There's deep concern that the acidic industrial emissions from facilities around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrup_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Burrup Peninsula
        </a>
        are damaging the area's rock art, and expanding Burrup will make it worse. Under our environmental regulations, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPA" rel="nofollow">
         EPA
        </a>
        WA appeals convenor is currently considering the approval of this project. This is the same EPA that was called by the WA Premier and told to lay off imposing requirements on the gas industry. A recommendation will be made to the state minister, who will make a decision about project approval. I don't hold out huge hope that our long-term interests will trump the gas industry's interests in this decision. After this the federal minister would also need to approve the project. I've met with the minister, reiterated the importance of this project and implored her to exercise her power to undertake her own separate assessment of the proposal and not rely on the WA government's assessment. I appreciate that she said she would be considering the matter on its merits when it comes before her. I thank all constituents who have contacted me about this project and reiterate that I will continue to encourage the government to consider its impact on the unique wildlife in the region, our cultural history and the planet.
