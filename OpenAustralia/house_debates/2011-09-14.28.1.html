        I would like to read out a statement on behalf of an Indigenous work experience student I hosted this week. It reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Carly-Jade Chesterfield; Iâ€™m 16 years old and currently go to Airds High School. My favourite subjects at school are Biology and Community and Family Studies. I wanted to be a part of the Learn Earn Legends program to get a different perspective of the political parties and a better understanding of the decision making process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The experience has been a huge opportunity to meet new people such as my parliamentarian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Mitchell
        </a>
        and his media officer, Jinane Bou-Assi, along with two journalists, Richard Willingham from the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        , and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
         Matt Johnson
        </a>
        from the

         </a>
        </i>
        . I have also met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Chalmers
        </a>
        who is Chief of Staff to the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, who gives advice to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         Wayne Swan
        </a>
        . I also met the media adviser, Adam Collins. By meeting those people it has given me a taste of what they do in their fields, it has also given me more self confidence with meeting new people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hopefully at the end of the program I will get a better understanding of the political procedures along with real life hands-on experience. Another thing I will get out of this program will be exploring the different opportunities that are offered within the political field.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So far in the Learn Earn Legends program I have seen the structure of the House of Representatives, also I have learnt about the differences of the political parties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was a great opportunity and feeling when I got to see the Prime Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        walk into the chamber before she introduced the carbon price bill. Personally seeing Julia Gillard was one of the best experiences I have been part of and I think will never forget the time spent in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        with the amazing people I have seen and met during the time spent here.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great privilege to have the opportunity to host this young intelligent person in our office. I wish Carly very well for the future. She has a very bright future ahead of her.
