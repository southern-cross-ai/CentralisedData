        My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer to his previous answer, in which he referred to technical colleges. Is the Treasurer aware that only one student is enrolled at the Gladstone technical college, that there are fewer than 100 students enrolled in the other three Australian technical colleges currently open for business and that three promised colleges may not open at all? Treasurer, doesn’t this mean that your colleges will produce fewer than 100 qualified tradespeople by 2010, the year the

         As I said earlier, the Australian government has set aside money to build Australian technical colleges: $350 million for 25 of them. Four of those technical colleges are currently open, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
          Port Macquarie
         </a>
         , east Melbourne, Gladstone and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Coast
         </a>
         . This is the first time the Australian government has ever set aside money for technical colleges, and people might wonder why it took until 2005 for the Australian government to get into the business of funding and establishing Australian technical colleges. The reason why it took until 2005 for the Australian government to establish Australian technical colleges was that, since the dawn of Federation, the states used to run technical schools which were open to secondary students who wanted a career. Why are those technical schools no longer open in the state of Victoria? There are now no technical schools. Let me tell you why, and it is very instructive: when the socialist Left took control of the Victorian government, under

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Kirner" rel="nofollow">
          Joan Kirner
         </a>
         —the same faction as was advised by the then junior member for Jagajaga—they decided as an arm of policy to abolish technical schools in the state of Victoria. It was an arm of policy. It was decided that all students should go to comprehensive high schools and, as a matter of policy, all technical schools in Victoria were closed.

                 As a consequence of that, there were people who were apt at technical training, who wanted it and who would have appreciated it who were pushed into the university stream. A consequence of that is they did not have the opportunity to go to an Australian or in fact a state technical college. This is the government that stepped in to remedy that defect. This is the government that set aside $350 million to do what no Australian government has ever done. This is the government that is setting up those Australian technical colleges, and for $350 million in 25 colleges it will be a very worthwhile investment.

                   I have to say I did not hear it, but if the Manager of Opposition Business finds it offensive I will ask the member for Sturt to withdraw.

                    Mr Speaker, is ‘hypocrite’ an unparliamentary remark? It didn’t used to be.

                     Mr Speaker, again on a point order: it is my clear understanding it is you who adjudicates as to what is an unparliamentary remark. You asked the member for Sturt to withdraw one; he refused to do so. Your only course now is to deal with him under the standing orders and suspend him from service of the House.
