       <p>
        On Friday we saw a wonderful event take place at Panthers—the Penrith Valley Sports Foundation annual night of nights, where we as a community got to acknowledge some of the best and brightest sports stars, administrators and rising stars across our community. I would like to thank Terry McCallum and the Penrith Valley Sports Foundation for the work that they did and for acknowledging some of our really wonderful local identities.
