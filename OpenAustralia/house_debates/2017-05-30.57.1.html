           The member for Richmond may like to know that under the Turnbull government's increase in school funding the 80 schools in her electorate will get an extra $4.1 million—$4.1 million! But that is not as good as the electorate of the member for Maribyrnong, where there are 54 schools which will get an average of $7.2 million. Or the alternative Leader of the Opposition—

               Forty-nine schools in his electorate will get the benefit of an extra $4.8 million. Or there is the other alternative Leader of the Opposition—the one who is leading in the polls with 30.7 per cent—the member for Sydney, who gave up that foreign affairs portfolio to get closer to the action only to be gazumped by the education minister when it came to schools funding! In her electorate of Sydney, as a result of the Turnbull government's policies 40 schools will get an average of $2.5 million each. And the list goes on.

                Archdiocese of Brisbane
               </a>
               , which said, 'We thank the Turnbull government for the work that they have done on education—increased funding, no decreases in fees.' And what did the member for Sydney say? 'Oh, they only represent 140 schools.' So suddenly, the Archdiocese representing 140 schools does not count. But, really, when it comes to those opposite—

                  I am not sure if the member for Sydney wants me to address her point of order. If she is going to interject I can just ignore it.

                  It was not; it was you, again! Again! The member for Sydney well knows that the minister is on the policy topic. He was asked about education and he was asked about the government's school funding package. He is entirely within order.

                   Thank you, Mr Speaker. The message is clear to the member for Richmond that schools in her electorate will benefit greatly, just as they will in the member for Sydney's electorate and the member for Maribyrnong's electorate. When the Labor Party talk about increased funding for schools, we know that they do not fund it. And we know that it is funny money, because the member for Sydney said, 'We will replace every cent of that $22 billion,' and the final word goes to the member for
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   , because he said, 'Well, it's not going to be $22 billion necessarily.' So not only are they denying the constituents of their own electorates more funding under the Turnbull government's plan; they do not even know how much of that they will be providing to schools across Australia.
