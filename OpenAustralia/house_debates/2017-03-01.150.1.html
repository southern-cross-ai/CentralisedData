        I am pleased to announce to the parliament today that from 6 March the

        District Soldiers' Memorial Hospital will begin a three-month trial of having an overnight doctor. This is fantastic news for my community. Until this time, if it was two in the morning and you had a sick child you would have to bundle your child in the car and take them on the long trip down to Adelaide. It was the biggest issue the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Hills
        </a>
        community raised with me during the election campaign, and I extend my gratitude to the state Minister for Health, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Snelling" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Snelling
        </a>
        , for his willingness to negotiate on this very important issue. I have full confidence that the three-month trial will show the need for the service to be implemented permanently.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this is great news, there remain many health issues in my electorate, some federal and some state, that need to be addressed. We need a renal dialysis service in the Adelaide Hills. As many of you know, dialysis is a commitment of three days per week. A unit would save more than 1,500 trips to Adelaide each year for residents in my community. It would also relieve the burden on major hospitals. We need a headspace in my community and access to better mental health services, particularly on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Kangaroo Island
        </a>
        . I run a youth forum every two months called Young Mayo and it is absolutely packed; there is never a chair left. These young people are currently working on a petition that they are distributing through the community to get better health services, particularly better mental health services, for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several constituents have also raised with me the lack of Medicare-rebatable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">
         MRI
        </a>
        access in our region. Up to 20 patients a day travel to Adelaide to have a scan because they cannot afford the $300-plus cost to have a scan in Mount Barker. That is 7,300 visits per year. These are pensioners, people on Centrelink and people who are vulnerable in our community. I will continue to advocate to the federal health minister on this issue and I am hopeful that we will secure a Medicare licence for a private MRI machine to be located in the Adelaide Hills.
       </p>
       <p>
        While today is a great news day for citizens in Mount Barker and across the Adelaide Hills, I want them to know that I will continue to fight for health services in our region, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pleasant" rel="nofollow">

        all the way down to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Harbor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and through Kangaroo Island. If you do not have your health, you have nothing. We deserve the same services that metro Adelaide receives.
