       <p>
        I rise to talk of the productive and beneficial relationship that has developed between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindfield_East" rel="nofollow">
         Lindfield East
        </a>
        Public School in my electorate of Bradfield and Menindee Central School which is located in the far west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . This positive relationship involves a great deal of interschool contact, as students from both schools have the opportunity to visit each other's schools, which are 1,000 kilometres apart and, in many ways, in different worlds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The relationship was the brainchild of Mark Cepak, whose son attended Lindfield East. He visited Menindee Central School and was struck by the beauty of the outback, but also by the school's art program and the distinctive art produced by the students under the guidance of art teacher Rick Ball and Principal Brian Debus. I was privileged to attend an exhibition of Menindee Central's artwork at a gallery in Sydney last year, and I can attest to the skill and vibrancy of the work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Saturday, I joined a group of Menindee kids, teachers and parents, along with local kids and parents, at the East Lindfield Deli in the Park to present awards to students from Menindee public school, Lindfield East public school and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killara_High_School" rel="nofollow">

        . I want to congratulate

        , Principal of Killara High; and Brian Debus, Principal of Menindee Central School for this very productive relationship between schools in very different parts of Australia. And, finally, I want to congratulate the kids of all of these schools for their enthusiastic engagement with each other and the excellent artworks from the Menindee students.
