        It is my sad duty to report the recent sudden passing of Greg Sutherland in Mackay. Greg's ill health over a number of years never slowed him down, even when he lost a leg to diabetes. He rolled up his sleeves every day to help people in any way he could. Greg had the admiration and respect of just about everyone in the community. He was most famous for his tireless efforts in delivering a rugby league stadium for Mackay, where the field is now called the Greg Sutherland Oval. He was president of the Mackay and District Rugby League for 13 years, and was instrumental in bringing

        trial matches to Mackay.
       </p>
       <p>
        But his impact on the community went far beyond rugby league. He was a Rotarian, passionate about making the world a better place. He was an acknowledged leader of the

        community. He was an advocate for the Indigenous community, having set up the Mackay Regional Aboriginal and Islander Development Association. He was passionate for anyone who needed help. I have to say that he as was passionate about jobs, as the director of Skills Training Mackay. In fact, a few days before he died we shared a meal and he talked about his latest idea for a jobs project that he was trying to pitch to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every community needs a Greg Sutherland and the Mackay community is a poorer place for the loss of ours. He will be missed by us all and especially by his widow, Blanche, and by his children.
