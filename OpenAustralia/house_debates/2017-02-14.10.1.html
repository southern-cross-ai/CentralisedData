        I rise today to pay tribute to the work of volunteer bushfire brigades that cover my electorate and surrounding areas, who last week kept under control a blaze near Wungong and Bedfordale. Through the fantastic work of these volunteer firefighters and with some good luck from the rain, the fire was contained before any homes could be damaged or lives lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Growing up in the Kelmscott Hills, my family and I know only too well how much people in our region rely on the services of the volunteer bushfire brigade and their firefighters. Everyone is well aware of the vital work that these volunteers put into protecting our community during the tragic 2011 Kelmscott-Roleystone fires. Volunteer brigades must be able to have the capacity to defend our homes from bushfires and that requires funding, which is why I welcome the commitment made by WA Labor for an additional $300,000 in funding for bushfire brigades in the city of Armadale and the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale.

        , Barry Urban, is a volunteer bushfire fighter himself and was out with the brigade this week. He knows that our brigades need support, and this funding commitment will go a long way towards ensuring our volunteers have the best possible equipment and facilities to continue their fantastic work. So, once again, I place on the record my thanks to the volunteers who, along with firefighters from DPAW and

        </a>
        , continue to keep our community safe during these hot summer months. We all sleep better at night knowing that they have got our backs.
