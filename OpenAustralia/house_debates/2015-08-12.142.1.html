       <p>
        I take this opportunity to speak today about the fact that on the 22nd of last month the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        signed a $100 million contract with Thales and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithgow_Small_Arms_Factory" rel="nofollow">
         Lithgow Small Arms Factory
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Tuesday" rel="nofollow">
         Last Tuesday
        </a>
        we visited Thales to mark the official signing. It is a new era for the Australian Defence Force with the entrance of the F90 assault rifle. The F90 is a light, versatile weapon that has been well received by our soldiers during trials—and by our special forces especially. Our soldiers deserve the best equipment that is of a high standard and is reliable. This agreement ensures our troops are using world-class weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        The F90 is born from over 100 years of engineering and manufacturing expertise in Lithgow. It is the latest chapter in Lithgow Arms' long contribution to Australian military operations. It is 103 years this year since it was opened. Australians have carried weapons made in Lithgow in Gallipoli,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         North Africa
        </a>
        , Borneo, Kokoda, Iraq and Afghanistan. The contract is good news not only for the Australian Defence Force but for the community of Lithgow and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">
         Central West
        </a>
        . It secures an existing 130 jobs—welcome news for the workers, some of whom started as apprentices at age 15 and are still working in the factory 40 years later. Ten new jobs have been generated, bringing the total workforce to 140. Over the next six years the local workers will manufacture 30,000 rifles and 2,500 grenade launchers plus spare parts and auxiliaries. Lithgow Small Arms is where all the Defence Force small arms are rehabilitated, including the .50 calibre machine guns. It is a long and incredible history. Very few people realise the depth of experience of the tradesmen and their quality,—just how good they are—and if any member of this parliament wants to see Australian workmanship at its best I will gladly take them through the small arms factory to show them how good it is.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commitment shows our government is fighting hard to keep manufacturing jobs local, because, let me tell you, there were a lot of outside-produced weapons put in front of the Army or the Defence Force for their perusal. I am very proud of what we are able to do in our country, in Lithgow and in my electorate. The industry is in the midst of some tough times in the Central West, but this shows how good a job we can do given the opportunity to do so.
