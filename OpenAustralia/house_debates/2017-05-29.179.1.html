        This may have escaped your attention, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, but today I have been hobbling around this place like a poor imitation of

        ! But I can assure you there is a very good reason for that. It is that I was one of 35,000 who took part in the annual

        Run for a Reason yesterday, and it was a glorious morning at that. Throughout my electorate of the federal seat of Perth, 35,000 of us took off on the half-marathon, which started bright and early—it was a bit chilly but, once we got going, we were okay—the 12-kilometre run, the four-kilometre run or the four-kilometre walk. It was a beautiful course that ran through

        It was a terrific event. Not only was it a great event to bring the community together; it raised an enormous amount of much needed money for charities. There was $1,127,515.72 raised to support the Cancer Council of

        and Diabetes WA. It was a terrific example of how the community can come together to promote healthy living, and it was all for a good cause. Well done to the organisers at HBF and well done to every one of those 35,000 who got over the finish line.
