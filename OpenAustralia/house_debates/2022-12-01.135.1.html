       <p>
        I'm deeply honoured to stand here today and read a speech prepared by Will Cullen, a local Macarthur high school student,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDRF" rel="nofollow">
         JDRF
        </a>
        ambassador and patient of mine, as part of the Raise Our Voice campaign. Will states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hi, my name is Will, and I am 17 years old and am just about to complete my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_School_Certificate" rel="nofollow">
         Higher School Certificate
        </a>
        and enter the adult working world!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been living with Type 1 Diabetes since I was 2 years old and luckily for me, my family has been able to afford the many costs associated with living with Type 1.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My concern now is about how I am going to be able to afford to take over the costs of managing my diabetes along with all the extra costs I will now have as I leave school and start working.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The cost of fuel and tolls are going up constantly and I hope that they government will look at how they can help support young people like me, about to start an apprenticeship and begin the rest of our lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I don't ever want to be in a position where I have to choose between fuel and diabetes supplies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Being a JDRF Advocate and involved in the Access for All campaign has been great and I am forever grateful to Dr Freelander and the Government for their support for type 1 diabetes, in particular the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGM" rel="nofollow">
         CGM
        </a>
        access funding and hope this will continue into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a great speech, Will, and I'm proud of you and everything that you've done and will continue to achieve. There is, you're right, much more to be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government is determined to continue providing the support and resources needed for those suffering from diabetes—type 1 and type 2—and I welcome Minister Butler's announcement in July this year that all 130,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes will gain access to subsidised CGM products under the National Diabetes Services Scheme. I thank the determined efforts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Diabetes Australia
        </a>
        , JDRF and local advocates such as Sister Terri Anne O'Sullivan, our diabetes educator, and the paediatric diabetes team at Campbelltown Hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's much more to do in our campaign against diabetes and helping those living with it. I thank Will again for not only his speech but his determination not to be held back by type 1 diabetes—to get on with his life being a productive member of our community. I thank him so much.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to wish all my Macarthur constituents, my parliamentary friends and all the staff in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        a very, very happy Christmas and new year and a safe one as well. I thank everyone for their support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank those in the opposition. We've been able to achieve a lot in a bipartisan manner in health care, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity that I've been given in this parliament. I thank all those involved. I thank my staff and I wish everyone a happy, prosperous and very safe new year.
