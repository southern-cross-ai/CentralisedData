        I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel if he would update the House on how the Morrison government is ensuring that Australian veterans continue to receive the crucial financial support that they deserve?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Menzies for his question. He is, of course, a former Minister for Defence, and he has served his electorate, this parliament and our nation with distinction. I want to thank him for that and for his ongoing advocacy for veterans.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our country asks a lot of those who serve and those who have served our nation in uniform, and we also ask a lot of their families. So the least we can do in return is make sure they have the best possible care, treatment and support our country can provide. That's why, this year, we're investing $11.7 billion to support 336,000 veterans and their families with care and support, including free mental health care for life.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the work of veterans' welfare can never cease, and that's why this week the Assistant Treasurer and I have announced that we're going to pass legislation to ensure that vulnerable veterans affected by the Federal Court decision known as Douglas will not suffer those adverse effects, that they won't have extra tax taken out of their fortnightly invalidity pensions—up to $100 a fortnight—and that they won't be hit by back tax. That could affect up to 7,000 veterans. We're also going to ensure that those veterans who've had a win and a benefit under Douglas will keep that benefit. Ultimately, this is about ensuring that there's more money going into the pockets of vulnerable veterans, and we'll be working closely with stakeholders to ensure that we can get that legislation right and get it through the House next year.

         Tomorrow, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Defence and Veteran Suicide will begin with a ceremonial sitting in Brisbane. Over the coming months, the nation will hear evidence which is very traumatic and very tragic, but these are stories that our nation has to hear. It is my hope, and indeed our hope, that this royal commission can be a catalyst for positive change in the treatment of our ADF personnel, our veterans and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to let anyone associated with or following the royal commission know that there is support and care and counselling available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for those who need it. ADF personnel, veterans and their families can call

         on 1800011046. For those who want to make contact anonymously, they can call Safe Zone Support on 1800142072. I would encourage anyone who feels in need of that support to reach out, because it is there and we are there for them.
