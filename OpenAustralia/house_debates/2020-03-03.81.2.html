        It is a sad day today. I want to acknowledge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAP" rel="nofollow">

        journalist who was here. AAP will not be operating here anymore. Those journalists will be not employed in those positions. We extend to

         Paul Osborne
        </a>
        , Katina and the whole team our best wishes to you and your future. AAP has had a proud history here in the Australian parliament. Many of us will remember Peter Veness from many years ago. He was a marvellous man who we lost to cancer many years ago. They have a wonderful history in this place. When you have such an important position, such as AAP, coming to an end not just here, it is a matter of real concern. We want to wish them and their families all the best. We want to thank all of those who filled the gallery on behalf of AAP in the past for all their great work. We wish them all the best on this difficult day as well.

          Yes, Speaker, I did indeed. Today is a tragedy for our democracy.

          , Lucas Koch, Mick Tsikas, Colin Brinsden, Matt Coughlan, Rebecca Gredley, Finbar O'Mallon, Don Woolford, Marc Tewksbury and Eamonn Tiernan, we wish you well. We thank you for your contribution over such a long period of time in terms of holding us to account and informing the Australian people wherever they live. That's the important thing about AAP, that, unlike the other bureaus, with respect, they got out everywhere. We were covered on radio and covered on other newspapers, including suburban, regional and rural newspapers. You will leave a massive void in terms of information coverage. Democracy should not be taken for granted. It relies upon the education and communication of what happens in this place and around economic, social and environmental issues to the Australian public. The Australian public will be less informed as a result of the decision today that I think is a great tragedy.
         </p>
         <p>
          On a personal level, I thank you for everything that you've done and I wish you well. I hope that you stay involved in what is an honourable profession in the media. We on this side have had a bit of a run in recent times, saying journalism is not a crime. Well, that's true, but it's much more than that. It's a vital component of our democracy.
