       <p class="italic">
        (b) NSRF is delivering infrastructure projects to create jobs in regional areas, improve community facilities and support stronger and more sustainable communities across Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my great pleasure to rise and speak on the National Stronger Regions Fund, which was an incredibly important program right across not just Victoria but Australia. We are so incredibly proud of the way that this program has made such a difference to so many regional communities right around the country. This has been a wonderful program. I know how much this program has meant to the people of Corangamite.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last round of the program, $13.3 million was committed to a number of very important projects. There was one in Queenscliff—the Destination Queenscliff project. I do want to commend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_of_Queenscliffe" rel="nofollow">
         Borough of Queenscliffe
        </a>
        on the work on this particular program, revitalising a very significant tourism town. There was also a wonderful project—the beautifying Winchelsea project. This was a project about injecting pride and investment in the town of Winchelsea. After more than half a billion dollars is going to be spent on duplicating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        —the township of Winchelsea is already looking magnificent—this program will really make a difference, also. There have been projects right across my electorate—whether it is Baptcare's Norlane community hub which is supporting Diversitat's vision with $1 million or $225,000 to upgrade refuelling facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethbridge_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Lethbridge Airport
        </a>
        . In an incredible project, $7.25 million was awarded to support Baptcare's Norlane community hub. This includes a very significant investment in affordable housing, in a new aged-care facility and in an allied health and medical practice. I know that is making an enormous difference to the people of northern Geelong. It, really, will be making an incredible difference to so many people seeking that access to housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am incredibly proud be part of a government that is putting regional Australia first, whether it is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        or critical mobile communications infrastructure—$220 million has been invested in mobile base stations all around the country, including 18 base stations in Corangamite. The National Stronger Regions Fund is yet another example of our government's commitment to regional Australia. I do note that it has received a very positive tick of good health in the way the fund has been administered. I do want to say that, in contrast, under Labor the report of the Auditor-General of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        into the predecessor of the National Stronger Regions Fund, the Regional Development Australia Fund, found that it was wanting. The minister at the time, the member for Ballarat, was found to have been wanting in the way in which that program had been administered.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are now about to launch a new program, the Building Better Regions Fund. This is yet another example of our government's commitment to regional Australia. Two hundred and ninety-seven million dollars will be available in the first round. In fact, the infrastructure round closes tomorrow. For all those groups that are scrambling to get their application in, it does close to tomorrow. Then, what we have done with this particular fund, in contrast to the National Stronger Regions Fund, is open up a separate community investment stream which opens up the criteria to a range of broader projects. What is also significant about the Building Better Regions Fund is that it is only open to minor capitals, regional cities and regional, rural and remote Australia. So the capital cities are excluded from this program. I think that has been a very important sign and a very important decision by our government in that we are strongly focused on delivering for regional Australia. We accept that not always do people living in regional Australia have the same opportunities as those living in the major cities. So this sends a very important message.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really excited about a number of projects that are going to be submitted under the Building Better Regions Fund, including a wonderful safe harbour project that has been driven by the Geelong yacht club. Again, it is my great pleasure to move this motion on behalf of the member for Mallee and to celebrate the wonderful work of the National Stronger Regions Fund.

          </small>
          <p>
           I rise with very mixed feelings about this motion. I note some of the things that the member for Corangamite referenced during her speech. One was that she thought this was an important decision—the new iteration of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
            RDA
           </a>
           F, if you like. In growth corridors it is a very important decision, because in my electorate we have been cut out of access to this new program. I rise today to speak to that—to speak to the value of what the first iteration, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDAF" rel="nofollow">
            RDAF
           </a>
           program, under a Labor government, delivered across Victoria. In the electorate of Lalor it delivered a significant contribution to the development of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
            Eagle Stadium
           </a>
           the newest basketball/netball stadium in Victoria, one that is now being celebrated across the state. It is a state-of-the-art facility that would not have come to fruition without the first iterations of RDAF funding under a Labor government.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would also acknowledge that in the last few years, in the second round, Wyndham City Council, with support from myself and state government, were successful in attracting $3.25 million from the Stronger Regions Fund for the redevelopment of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirnside_Park" rel="nofollow">
            Chirnside Park
           </a>
           , the home of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
            Werribee Football Club
           </a>
           . That redevelopment will mean that that football ground will be fit for purpose for a premier club in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFL" rel="nofollow">
            VFL
           </a>
           . I know how hard I worked in the community to support Wyndham City Council to get support from the state government to work with those opposite, particularly the Victorian National members, to ensure that that funding came to Wyndham.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is on the back of that that I rise today to say that it is a crying shame that this government sees fit to separate out from its notions of regions one of the fastest-growing growth corridors in the country—not just in Victoria. In the City of Wyndham 80 babies are born a week. There were 6½ thousand housing lots approved in Wyndham between January and July 2016. Let's put that in perspective. As the member for Lalor, I stood here when we tipped over to a city of 200,000; we are now a city of 230,000. That is the growth rate in the community that I represent. Over the past two decades, Melbourne's west had the fastest absolute rate of growth of any Melbourne region, and this is expected to continue over the next 20 years, from around 837,000 people across Melbourne's west to 1.2 million by 2031. My electorate has been absolutely cut out of accessing any of these funds to support them.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will give you a snapshot of life in Wyndham as this growth occurs. As families move in, attracted by the affordable housing that is offered in our region, as those families move in, as 6½ thousand homes are built in a six-month period and filled with people from across Victoria, we work every day on building communities from the ground up—from developing plans for the next school to building that school, to establishing cultures in those schools. Wyndham City Council works tirelessly on infrastructure programs, on putting aside reserves and building football and soccer grounds and netball and basketball courts. That provision is extraordinary, and of course it all costs money. This government's decision to narrow who this fund will be open to means that this community is locked out of accessing those funds. It is a crying shame.
          </p>
          <p>
           I note too the notion of regions, and the notion that regional people are only served by funds in regions. The member for Griffith was beside me before and we were having a bit of a chat about this. In the past iteration the member for Griffith was successful in getting a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
            Ronald McDonald House
           </a>
           built in her electorate. That is for regional families. Eagle Stadium is a regional facility and people from the regions will be accessing that. I think it is fairly clear that it is another example of this government's refusal to give Victoria what it deserves. It is ignoring Victorians. It is ignoring the people in my electorate.

           </small>
           <p>
            I rise happily to support this motion in relation to the National Stronger Regions Fund and its success under our government to date. The government's focus on regions through this fund and what will now be the Building Better Regions Fund is an excellent example of the fact that the Turnbull government is so focused on regions throughout Australia. It is these regions, certainly in my case in the state of Queensland, in my electorate of Groom based around the significant regional centre of Toowoomba, that will underpin the economic prosperity of our country going forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            I refer to recent comments by our Deputy Prime Minister by way of example, when
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
             Barnaby Joyce
            </a>
            made public comments and suggestions encouraging people to consider their future careers and family lives in regional parts of the country. He named a couple of centres in his own electorate, as he would do as a good local member, such as Tamworth and Armidale, and I am pleased that he also mentioned Toowoomba, my home city, the second-largest inland city in this country behind our national capital, Canberra. Opportunities abound, and I am so pleased that our government has focused on supporting them in regional areas such as mine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The governments that we have seen around this country at a state level, from our side of politics, have equally seen the benefit and the need to support regional development. I can mention the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
             Western Australian
            </a>
            government and the former Queensland
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
             LNP
            </a>
            government, which focused very much on region development funds and regional development initiatives that drive innovation, jobs and family improvement in regional areas. Therefore I am pleased to see a continuation of this effort by our government under the Building Better Regions fund. It will refocus the remaining funding under the National Stronger Regions Program to better meet the needs of regional and remote communities. By refocusing that funding it will create jobs and drive economic growth in regional Australia and develop those kinds of regional communities that people will want to stay in or continue to come back to.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fund is outlined under two streams. The infrastructure project stream will support projects that involve construction of new infrastructure or upgrade existing infrastructure that provides economic and social benefit to regional and remote areas. A minimum grant amount of $20,000 through to a maximum of $10 million will provide significant impetus for such projects throughout our country. The Community Investments Stream will fund community development activities including, but not just limited to, new or expanded local events, strategic regional plans, and leadership and capability building exercises. A minimum grant of $5,000 in this case through to a maximum of $10 million will, again, support those initiatives that we are so keen on seeing rolled out right across our country.
           </p>
           <p>
            I attended a community briefing session on the Building Better Regions Fund in my own electorate just recently. It was one of the most well-attended briefings across the country, I am told; it was fully subscribed. There were a number of local government bodies there, businesses, charities, not-for-profit organisations: a tremendously broad range of interest. I am personally keen on promoting, as a local member, two major projects in my region that, if successful, would bring employment, would continue to build economic resilience in our community and they would continue to allow Toowoomba to build on the latest wave of infrastructure, both publicly and privately funded. I refer to LifeFlight, previously known as
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CareFlight" rel="nofollow">
             CareFlight
            </a>
            , that essential regional health support service provided in the air by helicopters through to our local hospitals. I refer also to the tech park being proposed: a $62 million proposal promoted by the Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise organisation and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK" rel="nofollow">
             FK
            </a>
            Gardner. They want to drive data centres and other innovations that will bring new high-value jobs to our region for now and into the future; therefore, driving innovation behind agriculture, construction and other initiatives right throughout our region.

             It is great to see the government can actually fill the speaking list this sitting week, as during the last sitting week the government struggled to get a full list of speakers. This is the party that claims to represent regional Australia, yet up in the Federation Chamber it could not fill the speaking list on a similar motion talking about the Stronger Regions Fund. I note that this is not the only motion this week about stronger regions. This week they seem to want to talk about it, yet two weeks ago they could not fill their own speaking list. This really speaks to the chaos and the confusion of this government. Perhaps it is because the government is confused by the constant name changes to this program? Perhaps government members did not realise that it is the same pot of money. They keep changing the name to re-badge it and they say that it is new funding for regional Australia, but it simply is not.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government like to congratulate themselves and say that this is a great new idea of theirs, but it is not. The original form of this fund actually started under the former Labor government—
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
              RDA
             </a>
             F, the Regional Development Australia Fund—when we used to have transparency, when we used to really consult regional communities. In my part of the world, we used to consult through RDV—Regional Development Victoria—and then through the local RDA committee, which was the next step. This involved local, state and federal stakeholders in the regions so that they could put forward the best projects for their regions. The government has scrapped the experts in the community being involved in the decision-making, and has instead put it up to the department to say, 'You come up with the list.'
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the concerns that has been raised in my area about this current round is: how do you measure the projects against each other? You can apply for a minimum of $20,000 up to a maximum of $10 million. How do you rank projects against each other with such a broad and large funding gap? How does the small community project that may only want $20,000 to upgrade their hall compete against the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Bendigo" rel="nofollow">
              City of Greater Bendigo
             </a>
             , which might be going for $10 million for a major infrastructure upgrade? How do you compare roads with community halls? The government have not been clear to the community about how projects will be ranked.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am very fortunate to have very proactive councils in my part of the world.

             upgrade, funding for the Bendigo Aquatic Centre, funding for the Bendigo tennis centre redevelopment and we hope funding for the

              RSL
             </a>
             redevelopment project—although this is not yet confirmed. While all of these projects had strong support in the community, they have had to engage with a government that has constantly backflipped on decisions. The Bendigo tennis centre was first funded under RDAF, but after the change of government former Minister Warren Truss scrapped the funding and said it was not a priority and that they would not be funding it. The community rallied and worked really hard with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Tennis Australia
             </a>
             and, finally, this year the government realised the mistake and have agreed to fund their fair share of the Bendigo tennis centre. It is great news, and work is underway. We are hoping that they keep their promise and fund their fair share of the Bendigo RSL revitalisation project.
            </p>
            <p>
             Groups do get worried when they engage with this government because of the constant name changing of grants, the constant backflipping that the government do. Groups have said to me: 'It's not until we get the cheque from this government that we know we're actually going to get what's been committed.' We want to see the pipeline of funding continue. It does help create and secure construction jobs in our part of the world, and it does help create and build the needed infrastructure in our regions. However, smaller regional councils do struggle to compete against the bigger councils, and I do not believe that this government has done enough in the current process to ensure that those smaller regional councils have the resources to compete. We do want to see good infrastructure in the regions, but the government needs to stop playing politics. It needs to not change names of programs and it needs to commit from the beginning rather than commit, then cut, then re-commit. That uncertainty is just unfair.

             <p>
              I found the last honourable member's address to this House bordering on funny, because we had the member for Bendigo complaining about a program that has delivered for Bendigo. That does not make a lot of sense. The chief complaint we heard from members opposite reflected in that last speech was an awful thing has happened, a crime almost. Do you know what it was? It was the change of a name of a program. That was the only criticism that the member could lay on this government. It was such a shallow rebuttal and complaint of a program that has clearly delivered for her own electorate of Bendigo.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second and last complaint after a change of name was how challenging it is for governments to compare projects of a different size and different nature. Again, this goes to the shallowness, ineptitude and incompetence of the members opposite because anybody who spent so much as one or two days in business knows that is exactly what you need to do. It takes a degree of competence and this government has competence in spades. That is why we took to the 2013 election the commitment for the National Stronger Regions Fund, a program that ultimately aims to drive economic development, boost productivity and stimulate innovation by encouraging investment at the local community level.
             </p>
             <p>
              The coalition understands, unlike the people opposite, that the economy is not an end unto itself. It is in fact the means by which you can enable local communities to take control of their own destiny. It is the means by which vital infrastructure and services are provided to Australian citizens. And it is that understanding of the power of economic development that underpins the National Stronger Regions Fund. The scope of the benefits have been very clear; it has all been about economic advantage long beyond the construction phase. This program has focused very much on the regions. I have a few statistics. Total investment has been $632 million over three rounds: round 1, $212 million; round 2, $293 million; round 3, $126 million.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know this motion deals with Victoria specifically, and I have to say Victoria has done so well. Indeed the former member, the Labor Party member, mentioned the tennis centre—$2 million—thank you very much to the coalition government. There was almost 3½ million dollars for destination Queenscliff in Victoria. With no disrespect for the members for Victoria, even on this side, there is one place more important and that, of course, is the state of Queensland. I am delighted, as the member for Fairfax, to see a very important project become the recipient of the National Stronger Regions Fund in my patch of the world for the Nambour Heritage Tramway.
             </p>
             <p>
              The town of Nambour lies in the hinterland of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
               Sunshine Coast
              </a>
              and it remains the capital of the hinterland in that important and vital region of Australia. But about a dozen years ago, just over a decade ago, we had the Moreton sugar mill close and the town has gone through a serious challenge, with almost $70 million ripped out of its economy. The idea of this tramway is to use former cane train tracks as part of a broader reactivation plan for the town of Nambour. We have a local community Nambour alliance working so tightly and strongly, with a very good local councillor, to put together a reactivation plan for Nambour as a town. This is where the National Stronger Regions Fund comes in and will deliver half a million dollars to help that tramway get off the ground. It will be half a million dollars to help boost and reactivate the vital and important town of Nambour. I congratulate the coalition government.

              <p>
               I find it incredibly ironic that the government have chosen to bring on a private member's motion applauding themselves for their infrastructure investment when they have got an appalling record on infrastructure investment. Let's look at the facts. This government have cut infrastructure investment by 30 per cent compared to under the Labor government. They cannot even get their own figures right. They claim a $50 billion infrastructure investment agenda when it is only $34 billion according to the government's own papers. They mistake $34 billion for $50 million—no wonder the budget is in such a parlous state.
              </p>
              <p>
               When we are talking about regional infrastructure that can have such a massive impact on individual communities, this government's track record is appalling. We have seen a $1 billion cut to local councils for road investment, a $1 billion cut that, I guarantee, is impacting on every single community in this country. In my region of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
                Lake Macquarie
               </a>
               and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                Central Coast
               </a>
               , we have seen over $13 million ripped out of council budgets that could have had a real impact on improving our roads.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the last election, we saw what this government really think about infrastructure spending. It was blatant pork-barrelling. That is all it was. Seventy-six of the 78 coalition road-building commitments were in coalition electorates. Well I have got news for them. They have 76 out of 150 seats so they were able to form government but to commit road funding to only their own electorates was blatant pork-barrelling. This mob opposite have got awful form on this. We only have to go back to the last time they were in government, when the regional rorts affair was at its height. We saw, for example, $433,000 go into Coonawarra Gold for a project that was never built, run by a state Liberal candidate in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia
               </a>
               . We saw grants for a cheese factory that closed down, for a rail line that burnt down and for a pet food factory that never opened. This is the quality of infrastructure investment and regional grants under this mob. The great pity of it is that important projects are missing out on funding because of this myopic focus, important projects that do qualify for the National Stronger Regions Fund but miss out.
              </p>
              <p>
               The most egregious example of that is the Lake Macquarie Transport Interchange at Glendale. It is at the northern tip of Lake Macquarie. It is on the border between my electorate of Shortland of the electorate of Hunter, and all 11 Hunter councils agree it is the single most important project in our region. I think every member of this place can agree that getting councils to agree on anything is quite a challenge, so for 11 councils to agree that this one project is the most important project in our region is a significant achievement.
              </p>
              <p>
               This project will have a massive impact on our region. The previous, Labor government funded it to the tune of $13.5 million. One of the first actions of the incoming coalition government was to cut it by $1 million—that is their commitment to the Glendale transport interchange. That will have a huge impact. To finish the first stage of the project, we need another $32 million.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
                Lake Macquarie City Council
               </a>
               has committed $6 million to it. Labor, at the last election, made a commitment of $13 million. I would love the coalition to match that commitment, because this project, for a $32 million investment by the three levels of government, will unleash over $1 billion of private sector investment, which is cost-benefit return of over 30 to one; it will unlock 10,000 jobs in the local area; and it will lead to 6,000 new homes being built—all for $32 million of investment. Yet this government's funds will not support this project, and it means that the entire Hunter region will be worse off.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the true story of infrastructure investment under this government: a myopic focus on short-term electoral advantage; an ideological agenda of cutting funding for public transport, to support roads; and a completely missed opportunity to improve the economic productivity and efficiency of this country.
              </p>
              <p>
               I repeat the key facts as I conclude. Under this government, infrastructure investment has fallen by 30 per cent. We have them claiming that $34 billion worth investment is really $50 billion. All we see is pork-barrelling, and our nation will be poorer for that.

                I am quite pleased to talk about this fund, the National Stronger Regions Fund. In some regards, it is about moving the ledger back in favour of our contribution. Every year, people in the electorate of Mallee contribute $5.3 billion to the Australian economy. Now, I do not think it is unreasonable, given their significant contribution, for them to expect to be able to drive on a decent road. They should be able to make a mobile phone call—and I notice there is only one side of politics that have a Mobile Black Spot Program. They should have good educational opportunities for their children. They should know that when they go to the doctor they can, firstly, see a doctor and, secondly, be treated.
               </p>
               <p>
                The National Stronger Regions Fund is working very well in our patch. We have delivered $10 million towards a $25 million upgrade of the Mildura runway. This has ensured we have air services that link Mildura to Sydney, to Adelaide, to

                and to Melbourne. There are 140 commercial flights a week, as well as the very important work that

                do out of Mildura.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have $10 million towards the Grampians Peak Trail, a $28 million hiking path in one of the most beautiful parts of Victoria. This will drive tourism. There is another $1.5 million towards the underground particle-matter research lab in Stawell—high-end scientific research from universities across the world delivered as part of the National Stronger Regions Fund. There is $900,000 for sporting facilities at the South Mildura Football Netball Club, such as change rooms for our netballers and better courts, encouraging people to be more active more often in their sport.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is $800,000 to upgrade Swan Hill Regional Livestock Exchange, our commitment to a strong red meat sector—in contrast, I have to say, to the opposition, who when in government shut down the live export industry, and we saw the tumbling of our returns from red meat. There is $900,000 for the Horsham children's hub, lifting parenting skills in one of the poorer regions of Horsham.
               </p>
               <p>
                The party that I represent, the National Party, believe country people deserve a fair go, and it saddens me that for their $5.3 billion worth of contributions they do not get more services in the country, in this part of the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is $600,000 for the Kaniva nature precinct, giving people who are travelling between Adelaide and Melbourne a reason to stop and see the beautiful flora and fauna that we have in our part of the world.

                Country people deserve funding allocated to build infrastructure. Country people contribute so much and often ask so little. The two biggest sleeper issues that the Australian community is confronting at the moment are housing affordability and transport congestion—where people are getting frustrated and angry about waiting for trains that are full. I think investing in regional Australia is part of the answer if we are going to build an Australian society where people have (a) the opportunity to buy a house and (b) the freedom to live where they do not have to spend hours and hours commuting. Our National Stronger Regions Fund is delivering some of that infrastructure.

                I find it quite ironic to hear members opposite come in here and criticise the fund but talk about the projects that they were able to deliver in their own electorates under this fund. That, to me, says this fund is being administered properly; the Auditor-General is overseeing the administration of this fund. It means that the rollout of funds in our regions has been on both sides of the political spectrum.

                Really, this is the Australian people's money. It deserves to go back to the Australian people to build the society they want, and to recognise that regional Australia contributes to our electricity, our food, our natural gas, our iron ore and our coal, and to the Australian standard of living that we all enjoy. It is very reasonable that they have an allocated fund to build the infrastructure they need so they can have the quality of life that all Australians expect and demand.

                 It is pleasing to hear that some areas of the country are receiving support through this program, but this program clearly demonstrates—and the subsequent election result in Tasmania clearly demonstrated—that the Abbott-Turnbull government has given up on my state of Tasmania. Out of a total of 229 projects over three rounds, Tasmania received funding for eight projects. Out of a total of $632 million expended so far, Tasmania received $17 million. I know there are a number of projects that went through Stronger Regions funding many times but were not funded.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In round 1, I welcomed the funding of the Devonport City Council's Living City project, which received $10 million. I was an alderman on the council from the inception of that project and so it was especially pleasing that that project received $10 million, but it was only one out of three projects in Tasmania to be funded. In round 2, my electorate received nothing. There were three projects in Tasmania which received $767,000 out of $293 million. In round 3 it was welcome news that the Circular Head Community Wellbeing Centre received funding. The only reason it was funded was, in my opinion, that, in the lead up to the federal election, federal Labor committed funding of $4 million towards that project; the coalition and that then Liberal member only came in behind us to fund it. That project is really important infrastructure for quite a remote regional community which had no assets—its pool had to close down.

                 Having said that, nothing, however, has been allocated to the electorates of Franklin and Denison. How many electorates have missed out? How many MPs on the other side were really fighting for their electorates? It is an incredibly disappointing result for Tasmania and particularly after the global financial crisis which hit Tasmania late and hard. Councils were doing all they could to ramp up projects to get them ready for funding to drive jobs in the economy. But this is all we got. I think it is absolutely deplorable that the government can freeze indexation on the financial assistance grants for councils—and that all so hit Tasmania particularly hard with a population of 500,000 and 29 councils. You have to ask: how serious is this government in looking after regional Tasmania? I really do have to question that—it is absolutely deplorable.

                 There was one project which went through the Stronger Regions funding three times—at every round they put in an application—and that was the Burnie Tennis Centre. The Burnie Tennis Club hosts the Burnie International every year, and they needed $400,000 from the federal government to help reseal their tennis courts so that they could keep the Burnie International Tennis Tournament. For a small city which lost so many jobs when Caterpillar moved some of its manufacturing overseas, it was really important that the million dollars of economic activity was retained through the funding. The club did receive some funding from the state government, the

                 and

                 , but the federal member at the time could not bring himself to support the project. He said that it was not the federal government's responsibility to fund a council-owned asset. I find that absolutely ridiculous. The project went through Stronger Regions three times. If you think about all the projects in Stronger Regions that were funded, 74 per cent of those were council-owned assets. So in Tasmania we had previous members who are no longer in this place but while they were they did not really fight for their regional communities through a program which is there for regional communities. The results speak for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What is going to happen now? It is good to see that Stronger Regions has expended $14 million or so in my electorate, but now that the program is changing cities will no longer be funded. I know the member for Denison will be pushing for funding for the City of Hobart which is now included in the next iteration of this program. I know people in my electoral will not be too happy about that. Nevertheless the process hopefully is based on merit and, hopefully, we will see more funding come to regional communities in Tasmania.
