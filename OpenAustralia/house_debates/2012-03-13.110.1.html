       <p>
        I rise this evening to, firstly, endorse the remarks by the Prime Minister in relation to the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Broome and to add further comments of course as the member for Durack. Broome is one of the jewels in the Durack crown, so to speak. I wonder if any of us in this place have any sense of what it must have been like on that idyllic morning, a typical Broome morning, 3 March. You would think the world was a wonderful place. There was a little extra activity because of the comings and goings of dawn aircraft that were being refuelled on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roebuck_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Roebuck Bay
        </a>
        . Suddenly, out of the morning sky, came nine
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Zero" rel="nofollow">
         Mitsubishi Zero
        </a>
        fighters. They proceeded to bomb 17 flying boats moored on Roebuck Bay and left a total path of destruction, killing an estimated 88 persons. Twenty minutes of that and then there was a silence of aircraft, a silence of gunfire and a silence of bombs, but there were screams for help from burning victims. A tide was running and it was almost impossible to carry out the rescues of those who had been injured and the victims of this attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot imagine that we would have any sense of that. Immediately after the destruction had been inflicted upon those flying boats in Roebuck Bay, those nine fighter aircraft adjourned to the Broome airport where they took out numerous American and British aircraft. They left after, at most, an hour, leaving total destruction and about 88 people killed. Not one serviceable aircraft was left on the ground in Broome. The only Japanese fatality was a result of a Mr Gus Winckel, a crew member of one of the Dutch Dorniers, who was able to face an oncoming Zero with a machine gun from the hip and he took that aircraft down. Less than an hour and total havoc was wreaked on that idyllic spot, that jewel in the Durack crown, and the war had come to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Nevertheless, as things unfolded, the Dutch supplied great asset to Australia by numerous merchant navy ships providing a lifeline to the Australia trade activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 3 March this year, at the 70th anniversary of those events in Broome overlooking Roebuck Bay, we had present representatives from the United States embassy, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        One of the sad things that I am very frustrated by in my research into those days is that, because of the turmoil of the time, there is a lack of detailed information. The best of research through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        reveals numerous entries but, might I say, conflicting entries. One is not able to determine absolutely the number of persons who lost their lives that day. No-one is able to determine whether or not any local Indigenous people lost their lives. Some 25 Dutch nationals whose bodies were able to be rescued were buried in Broome and later exhumed and transported to the war graves at Karrakatta, a suburb of Perth. Some 25 bodies were so exhumed and transported. But one cannot get an exact figure or the list of names of those who lost their lives that day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of heroic deeds there are numerous examples—local people who responded to cries for help and threw themselves into high-running tides and burning water, covered in burning diesel, to rescue women and children from those flying boats. Not well known is the fact that from early February to that point in early March there were something like 8,000 Dutch nationals transferred from Batavia through to Perth via Broome—Broome being an appropriate landing and refuelling spot in the northern portion of Western Australia. So Broome suddenly became a hubbub of activity. And of course in the latter stages of the war in 1942 many things unfolded. There was a migration south from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Line" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur" rel="nofollow">
         MacArthur
        </a>
        directed activities in Northern Australia, and there was the war in the Pacific et cetera.
       </p>
       <p>
        More and more I find that this current generation is much concerned with those things that occurred during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . It is something of a phenomenon. Whether or not it is the passing of the veterans of those battles and of that era I cannot be sure. But it is certain that there is a renewed interest. This last 70th anniversary and the spectacle that was re-enacted overlooking Roebuck Bay on 3 March this year will, I believe, be an occasion that is rerun; the occasion will be used to pay our respects and recall that history. I note that more sage individuals than I have urged us today to reflect on the past in order to be better prepared and to cope with the future here in this wonderful land of ours.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I have had great pleasure in rising this evening to remind the House of the 70th anniversary of the events that took place on that dreadful day, and in anticipating that in years to come that fateful 3 March 1942 will be commemorated on numerous occasions and so teach us of the horrors of the past and prepare us for the future—a future, we trust, that will not see warfare on these wonderful shores of the nation Australia.

        <p>
         I too rise to speak on the commemoration services that were held at Broome in honour of those lives lost 70 years ago last Saturday, 3 March. I certainly endorse the remarks the Prime Minister made in the House on the last day of the last sitting week—the final Thursday. I also acknowledge the words of the member for Durack, who was in attendance at Broome. I was fortunate to be there on that day as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know about the war in the Pacific and we honour the memory of the great sacrifices that were made but, having spent so much of my life in classrooms with students, I think that we really never talk about the war of the north—the war of the north that happened in our country. This year, 70 years on, the significant commemorations that happened in Darwin are an indication perhaps of a coming of age when we can admit to the vulnerability of our northern borders and our historical understandings have reached a point where we can talk about the challenges that face us as a nation and the great vulnerability that we were exposed to at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, on Saturday 3 March 2012, all of those who were gathered in the central area of the town—and I think there would have been close to 2,000 people, which is not a small number for such a remote community as Broome—were treated to the most compelling and eloquent representation of the events of that day in 1942 by the students of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College" rel="nofollow">
          St Mary's College
         </a>
         . It was simply an outstanding re-creation of the shock and the incredible drama and sadness of that morning 70 years earlier. This event in 1942 occurred at 9.30 in the morning, on a day that we heard from locals was a very common sort of day for that time of year, early March. A gentle breeze was blowing, the water was sparkling and no doubt those people who arrived in Broome on 3 March in 1942 felt a sense of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the member for Durack has already indicated, the Dutch ambassador, Willem Andrea, was in attendance at the re-creation. I particularly want to pay tribute to the Dutch ambassador for the work the Dutch embassy engaged in. They prepared a very nice piece of history in this little booklet that is about the strafing of Broome. It tells some of the stories that I think have been lost and forgotten over the years and puts them together in this one place for people who want to read about the great heroism and the tragic losses of that war in the north.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Netherlands Naval Air Service was responsible for shifting as many people as possible out of the Netherlands
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies" rel="nofollow">
          East Indies
         </a>
         , now Indonesia—from Java to Broome and then through to Perth. Before the fall of Singapore, there were significant numbers of Dutch planes leaving the East Indies and heading through to Broome. In fact 57 planes were being processed through Broome a day—which is absolutely phenomenal when you look at the size of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roebuck_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Roebuck Bay
         </a>
         and the landing strip they had. In the 14 days before the Japanese occupation of Java 7,000 to 8,000 refugees went through Broome. This stopped on 27 February. There was a short break and then a window opened on 2 March for the evacuation of the last nine flying boats that the Netherlands Naval Air Service had. There were five Dorniers and four Catalinas. With that opportunity on 2 March they flew to Broome to refuel on their way to Perth. When they landed in Roebuck Bay they joined the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          United States Navy
         </a>
         planes that had a load of wounded soldiers and were refuelling there on their way back home. They also joined some members of a Royal
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         squadron. There are reports that on 2 March 1942 there was a Japanese reconnaissance mission to see what was going on in Broome. After they reported back, nine Zeros returned at 9.30 on that fateful morning of 3 March 1942. You can imagine, with so many people having moved to Broome away from Java, that all the accommodation on land was pretty full. These last nine flying boats in Roebuck Bay had many women and children seeking refuge on board. When the Japanese Zeros suddenly arrived, all hell broke loose, as they described it. The strafing began. There was nowhere to run. There was no way to get away from the sudden and unexpected attack. It was significantly women and children who were impacted in this terrible event.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Durack mentioned one very brave member of the Dutch navy who was there at the time, Gus Winckel. I had the pleasure, over 20 years ago, of travelling around Australia with my husband—not as grey nomads; in fact we were quite dark haired at the time. We travelled around Australia in a mobile home—'Harvey the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV" rel="nofollow">
          RV
         </a>
         ', we used to call it. We spent a beautiful Christmas in Broome. Little did we know, as we drove around, that Gus Winckel Drive, on the way to the airport, was named after a real hero on that day. He simply pulled a machine gun up to his hip and fired and hit one of the Zeros. Gus Winckel Drive is just an ordinary looking street as you drive out to the airstrip. You would not remark on it if you did not know the story of Gus Winckel. His four sons were there to honour him on 3 March and to recall his great heroism and bravery on that day. One man with one machine gun against nine Zeros was an incredible mismatch.
        </p>
        <p>
         In closing, I would like to acknowledge all the work of the local community of Broome in putting together such a fitting tribute to remember those lives lost on that day and the bravery that people showed throughout the entire war in the Pacific, and particularly the war in our own north. I would like to acknowledge the presence of the American Consul General, Aleisha Woodward, who gave a profound and moving speech about the loss of lives of men who had been injured in the theatre of war and who were on their way home, flying out of the peaceful haven that they thought Broome to be. They died that day and did not get home.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to acknowledge my colleague
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gray" rel="nofollow">
          Gary Gray
         </a>
         , the member for Brand, who was with me and gave an eloquent speech acknowledging the sacrifices of the day. I was very pleased to have his company on my journey to Broome. In honouring the people of Broome in their determination to not forget, I would like to acknowledge the mayor,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
          Graeme Campbell
         </a>
         , who is passionate in his leadership in that community. Obviously it is a community that really has taken on the responsibility of honouring this day in Broome on a regular and consistent basis. This 70th commemoration was particularly important. Eighty-eight people died on the morning of 3 March 1942. Many more were injured, and innocence was lost on that day. When we recall the sacrifice of those who fought for us, we finish by saying, 'We will remember them.' I can absolutely say with confidence that, on 3 March this year, the people of Broome very aptly and very fondly, with great respect, remembered all of those lives that were lost.

         </small>
         <p>
          In February 1942, Broome,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          , was used as the Australian end of an air shuttle service from Java. Hundreds of evacuees were ferried to Broome in Dutch, American and Australian military and civil aircraft, including flying boats of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas_Empire_Airways" rel="nofollow">
           Qantas Empire Airways
          </a>
          . By the end of that month the town was overflowing with military personnel and refugees. Most of the people were there waiting for flights to continue their journey elsewhere. During the final week of February 1942, it is estimated more than 7,000 people passed through Broome and, on a single day, at least 57 aircraft landed there. It was a tiny pearling port untouched and far removed from the devastation of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
           Second World War
          </a>
          , a transit stop on the escape route for refugees fleeing the Japanese advance in the Netherlands
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies" rel="nofollow">
           East Indies
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Broome was a place of rest and revival before refugees and war victims could continue their travels to safer places. However, on 3 March 1942 all that changed. Without warning, Japanese fighter planes attacked the quiet coastal community. The invasion lasted no more than 20 minutes, during which time 25 Allied aircraft were destroyed and as many as 100 people died. Another 30 crew and passengers, mostly military personnel, were lost when an American Liberator bomber was shot down shortly after taking off. Many victims were Dutch women and children, refugees and escapees who were packed into flying boats on the harbour either waiting to be ferried ashore or waiting to depart for the southern states.
         </p>
         <p>
          Young Pilot Officer Frank Russell described the scene as one of 'ghastly devastation'. He said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Our flying boats all over the place were sending up huge clouds of black smoke. Burning petrol in sinister patches floated all over the sea … All around us there fell a ceaseless stream of tracer bullets. Several of the Dutch Dorniers had been full of women and kids, waiting to take off to … safety.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was safety and a new life to which these women and children were running, which they so desperately sought and which they craved, but unfortunately it was not to happen on that sad and unfortunate day. This unexpected attack, just short of two weeks after Darwin was bombed, robbed them of the new life, a new beginning. Due to the circumstances of many of those killed, precisely how many people died in the raid and who they were will never ever be known. Only 30 bodies were ever recovered from the water. The bodies of the Dutch victims, initially buried at Broome, were moved to the Perth War Cemetery at Karrakatta in 1950. Many were not identified and lie in unmarked graves. This anniversary is an important occasion. It is an important and sad occasion for Australia and elsewhere, and is one we should respect now and always remember. Lest we forget.

           I also rise to commemorate the bombing of Broome during World War

           . I know this motion is very dear to the member for Durack, Mr Barry Haase, as the member who represents this electorate. During the war, the men and women of Australia had comforted themselves with the fact that our geography as an island nation was one of the keys to our security. An attack on mainland Australia by foreign powers at this time was unthinkable. Yet all this changed on 19 February 1942 when 242 Japanese aircraft launched an attack on Darwin. I know my friend the member for Solomon,

           Darwin was a strategic and significant Allies base in efforts to combat Japanese aggression in Ambon, Timor and Java. With two airfields and a harbour, it was home to the

           and Navy with five destroyers, an aircraft carrier and more than 25 aircraft. In this attack at least 292 people were killed and more than 300 people injured, although there is some dispute as to whether the numbers of dead and wounded are significantly higher than this. This was the start of more than 60 attacks on the north-west of Australia by the Japanese. Today we commemorate in particular the bombing of Broome, which was bombed four times between March 1942 and August 1943, first on 3 March 1942 and subsequently on 20 March 1942, 27 August 1942 and, finally ,on 16 August 1943.

           At the time it was bombed, Broome was being used to shelter Dutch civilians fleeing from Java as the Japanese descended from the north. The close proximity, active airport and sheltered harbour made it a logical choice for civilians and personnel and, at its peak, it played host to more than 7,000 or up to 8,000 such evacuees. As such, when the first bombing occurred on 3 March 1942, it posed a serious humanitarian as well as military predicament. Although Broome housed all of the infrastructure requirements essential to accept the humanitarian intake, it lacked the military requirements to defend itself sufficiently from attack. Because of this, it did not take much for the Japanese to inflict heavy casualties with an air assault of 12 aircraft. At the time, there were 16

           , Australian and Dutch flying boats stationed in Broome Harbour. Due to the composition of the harbour, only three of those could moor at any one time. The rest were forced to wait outside of the harbour. This does not mean, though, that we did not have any defence. One of the very celebrated stories of the bombing of Broome is of a Dutch pilot, Gus Winckel, who brought down a Japanese aircraft with a hand-held machine gun. Another aircraft was also dispatched; it ditched at sea off the coast of Rotty Island. During the attack, a number of Allied aircraft were destroyed, including many passenger aircraft. It is estimated that approximately 70 people died in the bombing, including 32 on board the one US Liberator bomber as it attempted to take off and including many women and children.

           One can only imagine the horrors that must have been witnessed on that day—fear and terror on an unimaginable scale. Following the attack,

           Pilot Officer Frank Russell, who had been on one of the flying boats during the raids, wrote of the attack:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           ...a scene of ghastly devastation. Our flying boats all over the place were sending up huge clouds of black smoke. Burning petrol in sinister patches floated all over the sea … All around us there fell a ceaseless stream of tracer bullets. Several of the Dutch Dorniers had been full of women and kids, waiting to take off to safety.
          </p>
          <p>
           We can only hope and pray that these events are never replicated on our shores again. Of the remaining three attacks launched by the Japanese on Broome, only the second resulted in further casualties, with one person being killed. The rest of the attacks damaged infrastructure, such as the airfield.

           Today we honour those who were tragically killed—men, women and children who were brutally taken as they went about their daily lives. We honour those defence personnel who sought to defend us against aggression, who gave their lives so that we may live in a free and democratic country. We honour those who saved lives on that day and who rebuilt the city in the days and weeks following. We also honour the fighting spirit that today still beats strongly in the Australian men and women who serve in our defence forces. We remember—lest we forget.
