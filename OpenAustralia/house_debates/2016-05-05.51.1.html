        Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I congratulate you on your service to the parliament and wish you all the best for the future. As we head towards the inevitable election, I would like to thank the constituents of Swan for putting their trust in me for the last three terms and briefly mention some, not all, achievements, including the $490 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        that I advocated for that was in the budget and is being allocated to the brand new railway line to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Wycombe" rel="nofollow">

        , the Forrestfield link line, as it has been named. Many more could be listed but I do not have the time, so I will not be doing it at the present time.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing I will not be doing during the election period is promoting a change to the date of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        from 26 January. I certainly will not be changing political parties for personal advancement. I have been a member of the Liberal Party for many years. I am happy being a member of the Liberal Party and can say that I have always voted for the Liberal Party. I have not voted for other parties and then changed to different parties. I will not be setting up a community group to promote a certain ideology and political agenda and pretends to care about the people in the community. The people in Belmont know about that. I certainly will not claim to be a longstanding resident of the electorate after working for more than eight years in Sydney. I look forward to the election. I will say that I will miss
