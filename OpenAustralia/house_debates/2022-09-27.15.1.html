        Recently I was able to lend a hand to support the hardworking people who are Care4Coast. The evening was held at William Street Mall in Gosford and was one of many such events that are held to help those who are doing it tough. Care4Coast is a not-for-profit organisation that supports community members by providing weekly hot meals, food hampers, toiletries, snack packs, clothing, haircuts, pet food and service referrals. The evening was successful because of the association with excellent, energetic volunteers Orange Sky Laundry and Dr Khalil from Smiles on the Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Care4Coast was established by Carly Pal, a local woman with a big heart. Ms Pal saw the need to support community members who are doing it tough and often sleeping rough. The core objective of this wonderful initiative is to enrich and support individuals and families experiencing hardship and challenges. This is achieved by mobilising the power of volunteers and the generosity of the local community. Care4Coast do an amazing job of making those who are less fortunate feel like they've been seen. The organisation connects with those who often feel invisible, and it is a wonderful thing when all people in society are cared for.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of Ms Pal and thank her and the many volunteers who work hard at making this local initiative a success story. I'm proud to be associated with this service, and I know the
