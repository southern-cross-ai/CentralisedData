       <p>
        Last Friday, 1 December, I had the pleasure of kicking off the Christmas season in my electorate of Brand, with the annual Mother Teresa Catholic College Christmas carols in Baldivis, alongside my WA Labor state colleague Mr Reece Whitby, the member for Baldivis. Hundreds of people turned out to sing, dance and enjoy the atmosphere. The students from each year group performed a collection of Christmas carols or Christmas songs, and I can tell you that there were many parents who were very proud of their children's performances and many children who were really enjoying the evening out. It was a beautiful night in Baldivis—a little windy, but that's the sea breeze for you. I want to thank the wonderful staff of Mother Teresa Catholic College and their principal, Geri O'Keefe, for hosting this wonderful community event at their very beautiful school in the ever-growing and wonderful community of Baldivis.

        There are more Christmas carols to come. On 17 December, I'm hosting another event outside the Darius Wells library in Kwinana. I will be hosting this along with the

        will be doing some singing, along with the kids who participate in the WA Symphony Orchestra Crescendo program. This is a fantastic program where kids from North Parmelia, Medina and Calista primary schools all get to enjoy listening to and learning more about orchestral music in their music lessons. I would encourage the community of Kwinana and the surrounding suburbs to come down on 17 December to Darius Wells library—and try not to be scared by Roger Cook!
