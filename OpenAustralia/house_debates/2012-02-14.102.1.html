        I rise to acknowledge the exceptional results of some of the 2011
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        students in the electorate of Lindsay. The HSC year is an extremely challenging one. It does not just test the academic abilities of students; it is a test of stamina, commitment and conviction. A number of students in my local community have not only risen to the challenge of their HSC year but have excelled by reaching exceptional heights of academic achievement. In particular, I recognise and congratulate Georgia Stellios and Luke Simpson from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's
        </a>
        Senior High School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Fox" rel="nofollow">
         Jessica Fox
        </a>
        from Blaxland High School.
       </p>
       <p>
        These students achieved the highest results in the state for one of their subjects. This is an extremely impressive achievement. Georgia Stellios achieved first place in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English" rel="nofollow">
         Standard English
        </a>
        . She told the
        <i>
         St Mary's-Mt Druitt Star
        </i>
        that she was ecstatic and shocked to hear the news and that English was not even her favourite subject. Luke Simpson achieved first place in the entertainment industry. He managed to achieve this result while also holding a number of leadership roles at his school, including that of school captain, chair of the student representative council and peer mentor. Jessica Fox is a name synonymous with success in our local community. Jessica has been excelling in the sport of canoeing for a number of years, having achieved two women's C1 World Cup gold medals and having previously won the Australian Canoeing Junior Athlete title and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIS" rel="nofollow">
         AIS
        </a>
        education awards. Jessica achieved first in the state for personal development, health and physical education. These three students are a credit to themselves, their schools and their families and I wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge a number of local students who were recognised as all-rounders. These students received a band 6—that is, over 90 per cent—in each of the subjects they undertook. The all-rounders included from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith High School
        </a>
        , Sarah Attinger, Luke Keanelly, Pradeesh Nallainathan, Shahrukh Shaikh, Anavi Suri, Vinori Vidanapathirana; and from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's Senior High School
        </a>
        , Khaulah Bachsinar,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Lockley" rel="nofollow">
         Kate Lockley
        </a>
        , Myra Lopez, Marissa Mellon, Tracy Mifsud, Muzammil Rajwani, Laura Sanford and Natalie Tai. These students achieved exceptional results across the board. Receiving a band 6 in one subject is no mean feat but to do it in all of the subjects undertaken is extremely impressive. I congratulate these students and wish them all the best in their future studies and careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I regularly see firsthand the outstanding efforts of students in local schools and to see achievement at this level is very gratifying for our community. I want to congratulate each and every one of those students for what they have done.
