        Waheguru ji ka khalsa waheguru ji ki fateh. In this year of 2019, we join our Sikh community in Australia to pay tribute to the founder of the Sikh religion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak_Dev_Ji" rel="nofollow">
         Guru Nanak Dev Ji
        </a>
        , on the 550th anniversary of his birth. On this auspicious occasion, it's also worth reflecting on the integral role the Sikh community have played in developing Australia's national identity. In fact, though Sikhism nowadays might be seen as part of a global religious diversity, it was not always the case. The story of Sikhism in our modern world is one of tenacity, zeal and commitment, taking its lead from the divine inspiration of Guru Nanak. From its very founding, this group of people have shown a revolutionary spirit that has preached equality of all humankind.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it was established back in the 15th century by Guru Nanak, Sikhism was unique in the social, political and gender equality it expounded. Through his teachings and practice, the guru espoused that all humankind is unified under the divine teachings of God, famously saying that there is no Muslim and there is no Hindu. That was at a time when religious conflict was rife between Hindus and Muslims. The spiritualism of equality and unity was an appealing but radical prospect for many people. It takes a person of great conviction, belief and a keen sense of justice to have the courage to go against the grain and preach this world view. That is why Guru Nanak was a progressive well ahead of his time. He believed in gender equality and he refused to wear the thread of caste, arguing that caste should not be used as a means of judging a person. He believed in living as a participant in society, rather than outside of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nowadays Sikhs do not adhere to the word of any living man but they adhere to the holy scripture developed by the 10 gurus from 1469 to 1708. Across this time, the key tenets of selflessness, earning an honest living and naam japna, which means 'meditating on God's name', were stressed as the most important aspects of Sikhism. The gurus also taught that disciples should strive to develop God's consciousness and carry out God's will on earth. That is why, from the earliest days, Sikhs preached and practised the principles of equality, freedom and justice at considerable risk to their own lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without a doubt, these are the reasons why Sikhism has found such a welcoming home in Australia. The very principles of equality and justice that embody Australia's identity are also key to the Sikh faith. Perhaps they were even developed together, because the first Sikhs came to Australia from Punjab in the 19th century, mainly as labourers in the cane fields of Queensland. It's no secret that these early arrivals faced substantial discrimination, including harsh conditions on plantations as labourers. Open discrimination and violence was a theme of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         White Australia
        </a>
        policy, which stifled the potential of this community and ensured it remained a tiny proportion of the overall population.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, despite the unfortunate past, Sikhs have a long and proud history of engagement with Australia. The British Sikh Regiment fought side by side with the Aussies at Gallipoli, earning Australia's deep respect. It wasn't just in this battle where Sikhs showed their strength; they fought with us in the battle of Malaya, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Singapore
        </a>
        and other hostilities. Nowadays Sikhs serve as members of the ADF, the police and the emergency services without having to compromise any article of their faith or religious beliefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a local level Sikhs have contributed to our community in deep and enduring ways. One interesting example is a gravesite in my home town of Whittlesea, commemorating the death in 1873 of a Sikh merchant killed by a horse in a shoeing accident. These historical insights are dotted around the electorate and speak to the layered history of Sikhs there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another example of engagement is the

        . As a Carlton supporter, it pains me to support Essendon, but what they've been doing has been absolutely sensational. This is a club for Sikh kids that's gone from strength to strength with equal gender opportunity at its core. One of the young players Divjot Singh even got the opportunity to toss the coin at the Essendon-

       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud that my home state of Victoria houses the highest proportion of Sikhs in any state or territory, standing 53,000 inhabitants. Indeed, recently, we had the privilege of hosting a delegation of Sikhs from the electorate of

        </a>
        to celebrate this. Headed by Mr Avtar Singh, this group representing the Australian Multicultural Foundation was a true cross-section of society. There were antique furniture restorers, trucking business owners and healthcare professionals just to name a few. It warmed my heart to see the integration of Sikh communities into Australian society, and I sincerely hope this process continues. It's only right that, after the Sikhs have contributed so much to the strength and diversity of our nation, we celebrate the very man, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who began this important religion.

          I second the motion. Many people in my community and millions of people around the world have celebrated the 550th birthday of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak" rel="nofollow">
           Guru Nanak
          </a>
          . His birth is celebrated worldwide on Kartik Pooranmashi, the full moon day, in the month of Katak. This year it was celebrated on the 12 November.
         </p>
         <p>
          Guru Nanak was the founder of Sikhism and the first of the 10 Sikh gurus. These gurus were responsible for shaping the beliefs of the Sikhs. Their birthdays are occasions for celebration and prayer among the Sikh community.
         </p>
         <p>
          Guru Nanak was a wonderful philosopher. His timeless teachings remain a source of inspiration for millions today, and the global Sikh community bring his teachings into their own lives. He brought equality, good actions, honesty and hard work to the core of the value system of his followers. He offered dignity to the people in the lower hierarchy of society by emphasising that everyone was equal—man or woman, rich or poor—and rejecting religious hatred.
         </p>
         <p>
          Here in Australia, Punjabi is the fastest-growing language groups with about 130,000 Sikhs calling Australia home. These qualities are ones I see evident amongst the wonderful Sikh community in my region. The importance of the Sikh community in the Coffs Coast and surrounds is immense. It's a very beautiful part of our country and it has the added bonus of having a large Sikh component in its population.

          where they were able to acquire leaseholds and freeholds on banana plantations. Indeed, Gurmesh Singh, a mate of mine, a Woolgoolga local, is the first elected member of any Australian parliament to the

          parliament from the Sikh faith. His great-grandfather Bella Singh came to Australia in 1895. The family moved from Ulmarra to Woolgoolga in 1950.
         </p>
         <p>
          The first permanent Sikh resident of Woolgoolga was Labu Singh from Belga and Booja Singh from Malpur Arkan district in Jalandhar. Booja Singh was the first Sikh to purchase a banana plantation and had a residence in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Street" rel="nofollow">
           Beach Street
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          There are now more than 2,500 people of Sikh heritage in the Coffs Harbour City Council centre. At Woolgoolga Public School, 21 per cent of the student population are Sikh; and at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolgoolga_High_School" rel="nofollow">
           Woolgoolga High School
          </a>
          , more than 12 per cent of children have Sikh heritage. Australia's first Sikh temple was established in Woolgoolga.
         </p>
         <p>
          By maintaining their culture, religion and heritage the Sikhs have contributed to the ethnic and cultural diversity of our region, giving the Coffs Coast area a vibrant and unique character. As well, the Sikh community has utilised their inherent agricultural background and skills in creating great economic success.
         </p>
         <p>
          Woolgoolga has the largest regional Sikh Punjabi population in Australia. Over the past 70 years the community has flourished. Sikh leaders say the town's Indian heritage would not have been possible without the welcome tolerance and encouragement of the wider Woolgoolga community. Regarded as an oasis of Indian culture and home to Australia's first Sikh temple, Woolgoolga is known among local Sikhs as the missing piece of paradise.
         </p>
         <p>
          Woolgoolga and the Coffs Coast truly are microcosms of today's multicultural Australia. I am grateful to our local Sikh population for making their home in our region. I thank them for the wonderful contribution they have made over many generations not only to our community but also indeed to our nation. I acknowledge the birthday of Guru Nanak earlier this month.

            Guru Nanak
           </a>
           , the founder of Sikhism. His birth is celebrated worldwide as Guru Nanak Gurpurab on Kartik Pooranmashi, the full-moon day in the month of Katak, in October and November. In this place in particular, I wanted to extend my warmest wishes to the Sikh community in Australia and particularly in my area. I join them in celebrating the 550th birthday of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak. The 550th anniversary should serve as a reminder to us all about the importance of the values that Guru Nanak espoused and promoted throughout his life, which include compassion, equality and humility.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sikhism is the world's fifth-most observed religion. It is a faith that believes in equality and service to others. Sikhism emerged, obviously, 500 years ago in Punjab. It was founded by Guru Nanak, who was a non-practising Hindu who was against rituals and praying to idols. According to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN" rel="nofollow">
            CNN
           </a>
           , Guru Nanak taught a message of love and that all religions were good. If you were Hindu, he said, be a good Hindu. If you're a Muslim, be a good Muslim. If you're a Christian be a good Christian.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to CNN there are 25 million Sikhs around the world, who hold services at temples and gurdwaras, where everyone is welcome. ABS census data from 2016 confirms that there are about 126,000 followers in Australia. Sikhism is now the fifth-largest religion in this country after Christianity, Islam,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_Hinduism" rel="nofollow">
            Buddhism and Hinduism
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Victoria is home to Australia's largest Sikh community, with more than 52,000 Sikhs calling Victoria home. The Sikh community forms an important and growing section of our community, with the Sikh faith being one of the emerging religions in Australia. The growing Sikh community makes an important contribution to our multicultural nation through its commitment to Guru Nanak's teachings of selfless service and social justice. On this special occasion we are thankful to Sikh Victorians for their extraordinary contribution and service to our local community.

           In my electorate we have a large Sikh community and we have incredible groups, like Sikh Volunteers Australia Inc., which provides free food to community welfare events, assists in emergency and relief efforts, and provides services to local community organisations, local councils and non-profit events. We see them everywhere. Last year we were fortunate to award a government Stronger Communities grant in Holt to the Sikh volunteers to help purchase a volunteer bus. The aim is to purchase a 10- to 15-seater bus that will take people in the local community to events.

           We also had an amazing event in my electorate—the 32nd Annual Australian Sikh Games at

           . Over 130,000 people attended the event over two days. We welcomed over 3,500 athletes, and they competed in over 14 different sports. It was over the Easter weekend. It showed, in conjunction with the athletic and sporting events, some of the culture. The cultural events and cultural stalls that surrounded it were quite amazing. In my time remaining I wish to thank the Sikhs for the contribution that they have made to Australia since coming to this country. I certainly wish them all the best and celebrate with them the birth of a remarkable individual—Guru Nanak.

            Like all other communities, the seat of Nicholls has a very strong and vibrant Sikh community. Some 40-odd years ago the first families came to Shepparton. They were able to locate themselves in predominantly a fruit-growing area where they were able to achieve the employment that they wanted. Certainly they have over the years really established themselves with their tremendous work ethic. They worked as casual orchardists on the farms and worked in the pack houses and the cool stores. For a couple of generations now they've owned their own farms. Certainly it is an amazing success story. So many Sikh families live in Shepparton.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Shepparton experience started with only 15 families. When there was fundraising for the Sikh temple in Shepparton, people did whatever they could to achieve the outcome that they wanted. They borrowed money and got grant money. They borrowed from other Sikh communities around Australia. They worked their way through so that they ended up with the result that they did. What we currently see is certainly an amazing result.

            I was at the Sikh temple last Wednesday to catch up with Dhami Singh, among others. Dhami was kind enough to invite me there for the 550th anniversary of the birth of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak" rel="nofollow">
             Guru Nanak
            </a>
            . It was a great opportunity. I met many of the women who were preparing food for the evening. I sat around and talked to them. I tried the special drinks, breads and curries that they have. It was a tremendous way to welcome somebody into their community. It was also an opportunity to spend some time quietly talking with some of the elders in relation to the challenges that they have in accommodation. Without a lot of backing they look after people who turn up on their doorstep. Also they look after their community back home. Many of the Sikh community in Shepparton have ageing parents who they are very concerned about. They look after them as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the Prime Minister has been very well regarded. He wrote a letter to the Sikh community commemorating the birth of Guru Nanak. He stated that this is a moment of deep significance for those of the Sikh faith and for all inspired by his teachings of honesty, equality and goodwill. The Prime Minister went on to say that Sikhism is one of the fastest-growing religions in Australia, with over 125,000 adherents.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the values of the Sikhs and their faith that we have all spoken about here today that align so much with mainstream Australia. We see the major values of equality, honesty, respect and the belief that anyone can achieve anything and that your status at birth should not define you nor restrict you in what you wish to achieve throughout your life. I've often said in this House that Shepparton is a great example of multiculturalism. It's fair to suggest that the Sikh community, which now numbers over a thousand, is a great example for all within that multicultural community.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, the Goulburn Valley Punjabi started to arrive around 40 years ago in the early eighties. Whilst they were first attracted to the orchards and the casual work that the horticultural industry was able to offer, many of them have since moved into professional fields as well as into transport operations. You can now see the Sikh community spreading its web not just throughout manual labour but also into the more professional outcomes that they are able to achieve as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also find that the temple, which was originally built with the hard work of only 15 families or so, now has over 300 to 350 families that currently and consistently use the temple there on a Wednesday evening and a Sunday as well. It's a six-hour ceremony on a Sunday. Certainly they have come an enormously long way since that land was purchased way back in 2001. They have had a range of priests going through. The priest I met the other night there is relatively new and is certainly making a big impact on the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            It really is an honour to work with this group and to be their local member. This is a very significant celebration for the Sikhs. I want to wish them all the best and hope that this respect, this honesty and this equality that they push forward can maintain their faith into the future.
