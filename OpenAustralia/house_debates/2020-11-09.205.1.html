        I encourage Men's Sheds across Canning to apply for funding under round 21 of the Morrison government's National Shed Development Program. Round 21 of the Men's Shed program will prioritise applications with a strong health, wellbeing or safety emphasise in light of COVID-19 and the needs of the sheds in the recovery period ahead. Additionally,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        equipment and training will be prioritised to facilitate increased connectivity for our sheds. Men's Sheds make a really important contribution to the health and wellbeing of our community, particularly for men. It's a great way to develop friendships and enjoy mateship and the community that the shed brings. Funding will give sheds in Canning the opportunity to upgrade their equipment and facilities. This will help them to become safer for members and even more valuable to their community.

        has a strong track record of support for Men's Sheds in Canning, including $200,000 under the BBRF for the construction of Waroona's new Men's Shed, and over $40,000 in support of the new Pinjarra shed. On Saturday, a week ago, I was there to celebrate the anniversary of the opening in Pinjarra. I want to congratulate Rob Hodgkinson and his team at Pinjarra Men's Shed for all the work that they have done in our community. I urge Canning's local sheds in Boddington, Waroona, Serpentine-Jarrahdale, Falcon, Rolleystone, Pinjarra and Mandurah to apply. Applications for the current funding round close on Friday 27 November. Get in quick.
