        I rise tonight to talk about the topic of history. History has been very topical recently, with people talking about what should or should not be taught in our schools, but I guess the practical lessons of history came home to me on Friday night when I had the pleasure of going out to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Wells" rel="nofollow">
         Two Wells
        </a>
        in the electorate of Wakefield and working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        branch there, which had just reopened after 35 years of being closed. At a time when many people are concerned about the fact that branches in organisations such as the RSL are declining in membership, here is a branch which is growing, which has restarted thanks to Tony Flaherty. On this particular evening, they had some 300-plus people at the Two Wells Community Centre to celebrate the opening of the branch as well as the 40th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that brought people to this was not only the fact that the RSL branch was reopening but the fact that the event was combined with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder" rel="nofollow">
         Rolling Thunder
        </a>
        event. Rolling Thunder is an organisation which originated in the United States but has an Australian chapter, which is looking at the memory and making sure we do not forget the lessons of those people who were missing in action, prisoners of war or killed in action during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        in particular. This event was well supported by acts such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blundell" rel="nofollow">
         James Blundell
        </a>
        , Acoustic Juice and others who provided good entertainment. But, importantly, particularly James provided very good support—and has done so over a number of years—as an ambassador for Vietnam veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        So this was an evening where we remembered and where we could also remember the lessons of history to apply them into the future. It was an evening where people celebrated the characteristics that were exemplified during the Battle of Long Tan. I am sure I do not need to tell people in this place about the history of 6RAR and

        , the battle they fought against the 275th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">

        regiment and the significant effort that was made by members of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Company" rel="nofollow">

        as they stuck by their mates through the night in torrential rain and awful conditions. At the end of that night, with some 18 killed and some 24 wounded, they realised that they had taken on a sizeable force of well over 2,000 and inflicted considerable casualties on the enemy. But it was an effort of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        , with air support from the Iroquois, and the artillery as well as the support from A Company and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APC" rel="nofollow">
         APC
        </a>
        s, who worked together to make sure that they did not leave their mates there. It was that emphasis on teamwork, on mateship, on supporting each other, that was being celebrated last Friday night at Two Wells.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I draw the lesson of history from the fact that many of the veterans who were there talked to me about how it has taken some time for them to heal from the fact that, when they came back from that conflict—they had served the country; they had done what had been asked of them—but they were treated shamefully. I think it is appropriate that at this time, when we have a number of conflicts occurring overseas where our members of the Defence Force are deployed, some for their second or third rotation through theatres, and where some sections of the community are not in support of those conflicts, we look back to Vietnam and make sure that we learn the lessons of that. Regardless of your perspective on whether it is right to be in places like Iraq or other theatres, regardless of your agreement or otherwise with the government and its decisions, it is really important that we support our members of the Defence Force who are over there—and not only the members of the Defence Force who are there but, importantly, their families, who are making sacrifices back here in Australia while they are away.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the privilege during the winter recess to travel to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        to visit some of our troops over there. I can report with great confidence that they are doing us proud in how they are serving. The quality of their service is recognised not only through their achievements but also by the coalition partners. I think it is important that we as a community learn from the history of Vietnam and that we make sure that these people and their families receive our unfailing admiration and support.
