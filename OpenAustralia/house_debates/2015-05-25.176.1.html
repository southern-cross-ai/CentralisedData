       <p>
        Last Friday I joined with the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Central Coast
         </a>
         Express Advocate
        </i>
        to host the Central Coast's first ice summit. Over 300 people packed the Mingara Recreation Club to hear from our expert panel, ask questions and provide personal stories about the devastating effects this insidious drug is having on our community. In a confronting discussion, we explored the ice epidemic, from the supply of the drug, to the experience of addicts and their families, to the response from local police and healthcare officials, and also the tales of rehabilitation. The stories and information shared at the summit will form the basis of a submission to the National Ice Taskforce on behalf of the Central Coast community. We have a wealth of expertise and experience on the Central Coast and, by developing a coordinated community-government approach to combat the ice epidemic, we can begin to break the stranglehold it has on our community. I will continue to work closely with my parliamentary colleagues here in Canberra and also the state member for Terrigal, Adam Crouch, to ensure that we have an action plan that our community can embrace to tackle ice usage.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing I would like to thank Superintendents Daniel Sullivan and David Swilks; Drs Kate Porges and Anthony Gill; and Joe Coyte from The Glen Alcohol and Drug Rehabilitation Centre. We have commenced our discussion, but now we have to build on these foundations and deliver real outcomes to combat the insidious use of ice and methamphetamine, especially on the Central Coast.

        And, to the member for Shortland: no, they were not tourists. Some even came from your electorate.
