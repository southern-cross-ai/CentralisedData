       <p>
        I want to acknowledge a member of my electorate, David Polson AM, who recently received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        . David Polson was recognised for his valuable contributions in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        education and for his ongoing advocacy for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTI
        </a>
        communities throughout his life. David is a remarkable survivor. He was one of the first 400 Australian men diagnosed with HIV, in 1984, when so little was known about the virus and about treatment options. In fact, there were very few treatment options in those days. If you were around or you remember that terrible time, you would remember the fear, the marginalisation and the oppression experienced by members of our gay community back in the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        David Polson was treated at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Vincent's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         St Vincent's Hospital
        </a>
        in Darlinghurst, by Professor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cooper" rel="nofollow">
         David Cooper
        </a>
        . Professor Cooper treated him with kindness, humanity and compassion as he underwent more than 28 drug trials over 20 years. David endured those trials to further research into drugs that are now available to prevent and treat HIV, like antivirals and PrEP. Professor David Cooper passed away in 2018, and he passed away with an unfulfilled dream of one day opening an HIV-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        museum in Sydney. David Polson turned his grief for the loss of his friend into something positive, bringing his vision to life, creating the Qtopia museum in Darlinghurst.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very excited to say that Qtopia has now found a permanent home in in Sydney, at the old Darlinghurst police station. Those who understand the history of Darlinghurst and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Oxford Street
        </a>
        would understand how significant it is that the Darlinghurst police station has been turned to good purpose in this way. The site now educates people about the history of HIV-AIDS and the struggles of the LGBTI community in Australia, many of which are still ongoing. David Polson is the chair of the Qtopia board. It is a fantastic, impressive board that includes my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Roberts
        </a>
        , who, as well as being one of the nation's best footballers ever, has been an incredible advocate for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTIQ
        </a>
        communities. It's an inspiring board overall. David Polson deserves to be recognised and acknowledged for his incredible work over so many decades, and the honour of an Order of Australia medal is a fit and appropriate acknowledgement for his work. Well done, David. Our Sydney electorate is very lucky to have you.
