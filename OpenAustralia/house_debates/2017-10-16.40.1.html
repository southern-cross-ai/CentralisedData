        On Saturday, I had the pleasure of attending the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club's open day and season launch. We were blessed with beautiful weather, which made a great day even better for the hundreds of club members in attendance. I would like to congratulate the club president,

        , and his committee for the wonderful work they do. Seacliff have pioneered the Beach For All access mat, which allows people with disabilities to access the beach. For many, this is the first time in years or in their lives that they have been able to get down onto the sand. Seacliff's dedicated young and not so young volunteers give thousands of hours over summer to keep our beach users safe by watching people swimming along the coast and by saving lives when they get into trouble.

        Senior club members teach younger members the importance of volunteering, beach safety, exercise and teamwork. They also help keep our community strong by supporting one another and having a bit of fun at dinners and at the very popular Sunday afternoon live music sessions. I have tried to do my small part to support the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club and was proud to secure several election commitments to help these wonderful volunteers. The coalition government is providing $150,000 to replace Seacliff's old surf-life-saving tower, and the plans are almost finalised. We are also providing a grant for solar panels, to help reduce electricity costs so that Seacliff can stop worrying about their power bills and instead focus on what they do best: keeping us all safe at the beach.
