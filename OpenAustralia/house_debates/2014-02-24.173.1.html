        I rise today to recognise a group in my electorate that has recently celebrated its 16th anniversary.

        </a>
        for Wyndham is an incorporated, civic membership based group that works diligently for the betterment of the Wyndham and western Melbourne as a whole. In particular, I acknowledge the loyal and dedicated

Today, led by Chris Potaris, the committee is dedicating itself to addressing the challenges that a region with rapid growth faces.

        Last week I attended a function to which the committee had invited the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bracks" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Bracks
        </a>
        to speak. Steve highlighted the need for groups like the Committee for Wyndham to drive investment in our region and to ensure our skills and jobs are not lost and that we embrace opportunities that lie ahead of us. That is exactly what the committee for Wyndham does.

        I congratulate the committee for its work over these 16 years and for some of the achievements that we have seen that are due to its hard work. I know that many in the community go to the Committee for Wyndham when they have issues so they feel need addressing, particularly issues around industry and jobs.
