        I rise today to acknowledge the many worthy Australians who were recently awarded Queen's birthday honours for 2021. The last 18 months have been incredibly difficult for so many Australians, but, as we confront the challenges of COVID, we see the very best of who we are at a nation and how this came to the fore. In preparing these remarks, it was wonderful to read the fine and selfless contributions so many people right around this great country have made and continue to make each and every day. Today I acknowledge two outstanding Greenway constituents, Mrs Jennifer Monaghan and Mr Niko Milic, who received an

        , respectively, as part of this year's honours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Jennifer Monaghan was awarded an

        . In my time as the member for Greenway, I've known Jenny to be someone of great intellect, vision and compassion. She is a fierce advocate for her community. Jenny only wants the very best for residents living in Kings Langley and is prepared to make the case for change when she sees a project or existing amenities just aren't good enough. She does it with respect and warmth, always very clearly expressed with asks that are realistic. Along with her loving husband, Greg, who is another great advocate for Kings Langley, Jenny is a long-term member of the Kings Langley Cricket Club. She currently serves as the club secretary, a position to which she is incredibly dedicated. In fact,

Congratulations, Jenny, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with you on how we can keep Kings Langley the very best place to live, work and raise a family.

        Mr Niko Milic was awarded the Public Service Medal as part of this year's honours. He played an important role in the development of communications protocols in aged-care facilities during the pandemic. As we all know, the pandemic presented very serious risks for residents living in aged care, as has been well documented. However, Mr Milic's work has ensured we can keep our most vulnerable members of our community safe in a way which doesn't leave them socially isolated during this very distressing time. We certainly owe Mr Milic and, indeed, our Public Service more broadly—all those frontline workers—our thanks for their diligence throughout the pandemic. Congratulations, Mr Milic, on your well-deserved recognition.
