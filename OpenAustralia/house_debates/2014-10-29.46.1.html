        It is spring in Adelaide and it is school fair season. Last weekend there were three school fairs held in my electorate. The Westbourne Park Primary School opened 28 August 1914. They are celebrating this year their centenary. They have had a number of famous old scholars, arguably the most famous of all is

        , who won the 2005
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" rel="nofollow">

        for medicine and physiology. Rod and Lynn Hook have three generations of their family who have attended the school. There have been a number of centenary events held over the course of the year. There was an old scholars reunion with old scholars in their 90s attending, as did a lifelong friend of mine, Claire Leaker. The centenary fair was a fantastic event which I was able to attend with my family. I congratulate

        and fair organisers Danny Braddy on that.

        The Craigburn Primary School fair was also well organised. I congratulate Candi Hinks and the fundraising raising committee, which were everywhere with their yellow T-shirts. I was able to help out with Sam Duluk on the sausage sizzle and that was a very successful event as well. Ben Francis, an old scholar of the school, spoke as did Lorraine Rosenberg, the Mayor of the City of Onkaparinga.
