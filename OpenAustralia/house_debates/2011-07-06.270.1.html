        My question is to the Prime Minister. Given the very real concerns being expressed by northern Australian cattle producers in relation to the live cattle export issue, could the Prime Minister update the House on any protocol arrangements and any time lines on lifting the present ban on live exports?

         Order! That was an example of behaviour that people outside this place think is very strange. When people can argue with a questioner and not show respect or civility to a fellow MP, that is of concern to many people who view us. The question was in order. The Prime Minister now has the call to respond to the question.

          I thank the member for New England for his question. He is one of a number of members on all sides of the House, people of all political persuasions, who have personally raised with me concerns about the live cattle trade. Many people representing electorates that are home to numbers of producers want to know, understandably and somewhat anxiously, when the trade will be resumed. We are working hard and progress is being made to achieve our goal of having the trade resumed in circumstances where we can track and trace where Australian cattle are going and the conditions under which they are slaughtered in the abattoirs that they go to in Indonesia. Progress is being made. We do need to continue to work hard on this. As progress is being made there are some more things to do, but I can certainly say to the member for New England that we are not letting a day go by, an hour go by, so that this trade is not suspended for longer than it needs to be. I understand the pressure that is putting on the shoulders of people in the live cattle industry. We are of course working with people in the live cattle industry to meet their needs and concerns at this time. There is a $5 million animal welfare package and a $30 million industry support fund. I know that some owners and growers have been distressed. There was, for example, a gentleman in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          yesterday who made clear his distress publicly. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry ensured that he was contacted by the Cattle Council and by Centrelink so he could take full advantage of the support packages that are available to him. We will continue to work with the cattle industry, making those support packages available as we continue to work hard to resume this trade. I want to resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed.

            We will resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed so the trade can have a strong and sustained future for the long term. I do not want to see a resumption of the trade in circumstances where questions remain about animal welfare, only to have the industry again confront a problem like this in six months time or 12 months time or two years time. We want to get this on the right footing for the long term. So we will continue to work hard and of course as soon as I am in a position to give any further advice publicly, I will certainly do so.
