       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to Harold Stanley Payne, who died in Launceston on 17 February aged 87. Stan was a wonderful, cultured man who loved literature and poetry and bestowed his enthusiasm on several generations of Tasmanian teachers. Stan was born in Cardiff and was fiercely proud of his Welsh heritage and loved the music of the valleys. He joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Army_Educational_Corps" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        and helped prepare fighting men and women for demobilisation into civilian life.
       </p>
       <p>
        He met Barbara Luck on a beach in France, little knowing that their marriage would lead them back to Barbara's home of Tasmania. As well as teaching, Stan supported his wife in her community work, most notably as the

         Mayor of Launceston
        </a>
        . Stan was a proud constitutional monarchist and was in his element when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         Her Majesty
        </a>
        visited Launceston in 1981.
       </p>
       <p>
        He and Barbara had four children: Anna, Richard, Rachel and Sarah. They were proud grandparents of nine and great-grandparents of two. He was a compassionate carer for his wife in her final years. Stan was an ornament to our community and, although increasingly frail physically, Stan had a sharp mind right up to the end. I corresponded with him as recently as December and respected his old-school charm, coupled with a perceptive view of current affairs. Owing to parliamentary sittings, I could not attend Stan's funeral, but I know many did, including several generations of educators. I express my sincere condolences to Stan's family.
