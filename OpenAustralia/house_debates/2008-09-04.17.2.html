        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of the

         Shanghai World Expo

        2010, China.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 29 June 2006 the then Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard MP, announced that Australia would participate in the Shanghai World Expo 2010. This will be the first major world exposition since Aichi, Japan in 2005 and will take place between 1 May and 31 October 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the $61 million being provided through the budget, the government will seek an estimated $22 million in funding through corporate sponsorships and partnerships with the states and territories. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        has portfolio responsibility for this project and will manage Australia’s presence at the expo. In terms of potential to assist Australian business and raise Australia’s profile in a strategic market, this expo represents a unique opportunity, eclipsing in scale any previous expo, including Aichi. It is therefore essential that Australia’s presence at the expo be commensurate with our economic and strategic interests in China.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal is to construct a new temporary pavilion with appropriate public exhibition areas and capacity to host
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIP" rel="nofollow">
         VIP
        </a>
        , business and cultural programs that make up the Australian participation at the expo. The design process created a concept for a well-designed purpose built pavilion that will showcase Australia to the Chinese public, compares favourably to our market countries and provides a platform for helping Australian business succeed in the China market.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, a single contract will be awarded for the construction, exhibition, production and technical operation of the pavilion. A contract will need to be signed by mid-September 2008 to maximise prospects for commencing Chinese design approval processes and construction this calendar year. The construction program requires the base building to be complete and dustproof in the technical areas by mid-September 2009. Practical completion and occupation is scheduled for 1 March 2007, with commencement of the expo on 1 May 2001.

On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . The national office of the department is located in the Canberra CBD and at the Canberra airport in leases across 21 separate buildings, with a total lettable area of approximately 97,000 square metres. With the exception of the airport properties, most of the accommodation is in buildings which are over 15 years old and require major refurbishment to meet Commonwealth standards. The new building will be constructed on the 4,801 square metre site of the former

       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval and the satisfactory pricing of the tender trade packages, the integration of the fit-out is the department’s preferred option. Under this arrangement, the fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the base building construction, which commenced in February 2008 and is scheduled for practical completion in June 2010. Occupancy is expected to occur in mid-2010. Current leases have been structured to expire no earlier than mid-2010, to avoid the risk of penalties associated with short-term holding leases. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        proposes to undertake the construction of new warehousing facilities, at an estimated out-turned cost of $36.369 million plus GST, at Wadsworth Barracks, East Bandiana, Victoria. The project will provide modern, purpose built facilities to enhance operational capability and will provide efficient logistical and warehousing support to Defence. The project consists of the construction of a new purpose built support warehouse, a dedicated area for freight distribution and the demolition of redundant buildings. The project will also include upgrade works to address occupational health and safety issues and operational inefficiencies associated with the existing facilities.
