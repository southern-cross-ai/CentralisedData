         On indulgence and on behalf of the government, we'd like to thank
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
          Her Majesty
         </a>
         for her message conveyed to us this morning by you on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the opening of this parliament. All Australians are very proud of what we've managed to achieve here physically in this building but also in our democracy over the last 117 years. This is the most visited building of all buildings in Australia, even more than the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Opera House
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a tremendous program that brings schoolchildren here, which successive governments have supported in a bipartisan way. I have to say that, when I return to my electorate and talk to children who've been to the parliament, they have a lot to say about our parliament, our democracy and our system of government. They're very proud of it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would say that I actually did work in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Old Parliament House
         </a>
         over 30 years ago. I worked for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Vanstone" rel="nofollow">
          Amanda Vanstone
         </a>
         in Old Parliament House on the Senate side in the 1980s, and I came here as part of the new parliament. There are significant differences between the old parliament and this parliament. The old parliament was very, very small, but it meant that you were very close to people on all sides of the House. But it was not functional as a building. This building is very functional and much better for government and much better for a democracy of the sophistication and stature of ours, but it's not quite as intimate. So there are swings and roundabouts. I think, on balance, it's a much better parliament than the old one, and I'm very pleased that the Fraser government commissioned it.

         <p>
          On indulgence, I join with the Leader of the House in expressing thanks for the message. Thirty years—it's extraordinary when we think about it. I myself have been here for just under half that time; you yourself, Mr Speaker, for just more than half of that time; and the Leader of the House for almost every day of that time.
         </p>
         <p>
          In that time, I think it's fair to say the House has served us very well. There have been some changes in that time. Thirty years ago we never began parliament, as you just did, with an acknowledgement of country. I think it's fair to say that all of us are disappointed that events over the years have forced security arrangements, which means that the original design—where people could just freely walk all over the building—isn't available in the same way these days. We understand why, but the principle of having a parliament that the people could walk on top of is still there. It's a wonderful part of the design of this building, and the principle, going all the way back to traditional beliefs in this land, that the law of Australia would rest within the land is something that is in this very special piece of architecture here.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was there at the final sitting of the Senate as well, as a uni student, watching

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rod" rel="nofollow">
           Black Rod
          </a>
          looked very unhappy. As I look back on it now, being there was an odd thing to do as a teenager. But, certainly, Mr Speaker, I think your stewardship has been a very important part of this House as it has continued to develop. The traditions we have will continue to develop, and all the work that has been done on this building means that it will, hopefully, continue to serve the people in the way it was originally intended to.
