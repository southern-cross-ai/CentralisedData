        I rise today to speak about the

         Mt Gravatt
        </a>
        Show, the best little country show in the city of Brisbane. It was a weekend-long show of more than just rides, fireworks, show bags and farm animals; it was a show that showcased the very best of the Mt Gravatt community. This year, the show celebrated the huge milestone of 105 years. Those who came along as children are now bringing their children or their children's children. It's a tradition which gets bigger and better every year. I had the privilege of opening the show and was joined on stage by an alpaca who complete stole the show. What has seen the show go from strength to strength are the people behind it. The show president, Kim Goss, Loretta Smith from the Mt Gravatt show society, and the entire committee all work tirelessly to make the show a calendar moment for people across Brisbane. Thank you for your hard work.

        It was no easy feat this year. Unfortunately, last year's show was cancelled because of the pandemic. I know how much the show means to our community and that is why I fought for its return. Over $43,000 in federal funding was delivered this year and enabled the show to get back on its feet. It was funding that saw stall holders and small business breathe a sigh of relief after last year. I want to thank the Morrison government for the opportunity to see our community come together. Our government is securing our recovery by supporting the local community and giving confidence back to businesses.
