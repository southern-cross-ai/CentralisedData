       <p>
        Last weekend I had the absolute pleasure of joining the intrepid Variety WA Midwest 4WD Getaway participants. Every two years, adults go to a lot of trouble to dress up in fancy dress and also dress up their cars. They then head out bush, have a lot of fun and at times make fools of themselves. I can assure you that I certainly made a fool of myself. Whilst having all this fun, there is the serious business of raising funds to support vulnerable kids and families. Around $140,000 raised on the weekendâ€”absolutely amazing.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the Variety gang based ourselves at Mellenbye Station. This is a well-run station. The accommodation was wonderful. I want to thank them for looking after us so well. Events like these, which take place in remote locations, require years of planning. The routes that we travelled on are designed and tested, and then tested again, for fun and for safety. The weekend is intended to be an adventure, but at the end of the day we want everybody to get home safely and in one piece.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks so much to the many volunteers who helped to the set the route, who were on hand in case of car troubles and who assisted with logistics, running the bar, the set-up and the pull-down and the catering chores, not to forget the two volunteer doctors. I'd like to thank all the wonderful local businesses who supported the event, and a very big shout-out to Jan at Variety who brings it all together. Well done to our mates Dean and Angelina, who joined Brad and I in the 'witch' car. To our 'Priscilla' friends: you'll keep!
