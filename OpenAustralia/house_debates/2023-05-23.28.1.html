        We've witnessed some great changes in the first year of the Albanese-Marles government, but I want to particularly focus on our relationships with our Asian and Pacific neighbours and the wider world. No longer is foreign affairs used as a springboard for domestic politics—or, worse, a lobbying opportunity for jobs after parliament. I'm sure Australians recall former foreign minister Downer slotting straight into the board of Huawei, former trade minister

        What a breath of fresh air Foreign Minister Penny Wong, Trade Minister Don Farrell and their teams—I see the member for Gellibrand in front of us, the minister at the table—have been, strategically and methodically going about repairing the relationships damaged by the coalition, re-engaging with our Pacific neighbours via diplomacy and significant financial support. A safe and secure Pacific is important to the future of Australia, and good trade relations with Asia are the key to our future prosperity—and I don't just mean for our barley farmers, wine exporters or crayfish exporters. One by one, the Albanese government is repairing our trade relationship with China. It was good to see the lifting of restrictions on our $700 million timber trade last week. Foreign Minister Penny Wong is doing a great job.
