        Last March, retail billionaire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Harvey" rel="nofollow">
         Gerry Harvey

        told

        that COVID was 'pretty much nothing to get scared of'. He went on to boast that sales of his freezers were up 300 per cent. Since then, more than two million people have lost their lives, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Norman" rel="nofollow">

        has experienced a once-in-a-lifetime retail bonanza. Its dividends last year totalled $300 million, more than $100 million of which went to Mr Harvey. This Friday it's expected to announce a six-month profit of around half a billion dollar.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet Harvey Norman head office and its franchisees have benefited from millions of dollars of taxpayer support through the JobKeeper program. It's not the only profitable firm to do so. Recently, Crown Perth, Empired, Janison, MaxiTRANS, hedge fund K2 and investment bank Moelis have announced JobKeeper-fuelled profits. Some profitable firms have repaid.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIMIC" rel="nofollow">

        's recent announcement takes the total repayment past $100 million. These ethical farms realised that JobKeeper was designed to keep battlers in work, not to help billionaires buy their next racehorse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gerry Harvey once said that donating to charity was 'helping a whole heap of no-hopers to survive for no good reason'. He then claimed he had changed. Well, Friday is his chance to prove it. Mr Harvey says his sales have been 'going crazy', so it's crazy to think he needs a taxpayer funded handout. Pay it back, Gerry.
