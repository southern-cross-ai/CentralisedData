        It is a privilege at any time for a local member to be asked to open a festival, especially the Inverloch Jazz Festival. I've waited a long time to be invited to open the Inverloch Jazz Festival. I would like to thank Clive Budd, Jennie Deane, Graeme Morris, Patsy O'Neil,

        It's a magnificent weekend at Inverloch. Everybody should attend once in their lives, if they possibly can. It's not just the three venues that are operating over the whole weekend, it's not just the great opening night that we all experience but it's the fantastic country buskers that are on the street every day. There's a festival atmosphere for the whole weekend. The best part is that you get the musicians. They have the opportunity to display their wares in a way that they love to doâ€”the presentation they make, the efforts that they put in and the singers that are there.

        Yes, I had a bit of fun opening it, as you can imagine. I had a lot of fun. Give me a microphone and give me an audience and it is a lot of fun. We had a lot of fun opening it. I thank everyone of them, especially Clive Budd, for giving me the opportunity to enter into this amazing Inverloch Jazz Festival. I hope that every member in this place gets to open a jazz festival or something important in their electorate. You make it very special. These people not only made it special for themselves, but they made it special for me, because I really, really enjoyed the opening night.
