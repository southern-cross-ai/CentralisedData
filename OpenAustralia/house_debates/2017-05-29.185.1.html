       <p>
        I rise to give a statement in this final 92nd session in the Federation Chamber on a Monday afternoon. Opportunities to speak of the good of our electorates are important in representing the communities that we vowed to represent and the voices we promised to bring with us to be heard in this House. These include voices from local organisations like the Caboolture Neighbourhood Centre. Recently, I attended the centre's open day, where I was able to speak with staff and volunteers, schoolchildren and teachers, and locals who attended the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many people in our community who struggle to get by, and the Caboolture Neighbourhood Centre supports these people through courses, programs and support groups. It is a centre which promotes community and togetherness, the benefits of which are very far too often overlooked. It was great to be at the open day to see the smiles on the faces of local schoolkids, balloons and show bags in their hands; to see a group of people sitting around listening intently as a volunteer gave them financial advice through a presentation; and to see all sorts of people from right around our community and neighbourhood coming together for the benefit of and for our community. We must continue to ensure that the voices of our local organisations are heard in this House at every single opportunity.
