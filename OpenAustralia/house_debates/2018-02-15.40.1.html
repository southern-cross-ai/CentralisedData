        I rise today to bring to the attention of the House something strange that's going on in the ministry. There's no-one in this chamber who would be surprised that I have a bit of an axe to grind with the member for Dickson, the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        , about some of the things that he threw across the border from Sydney on 2GB but hasn't managed to come across the border into Victoria to say to the people whom he has offended.
       </p>
       <p>
        More interestingly, in December last year, the member for Aston,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Tudge" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Tudge
        </a>
        , became the Minister for Citizenship and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . One would think he might have a few things to say about that, but I go to citizenship ceremonies in my electorate all the time and council are asked to invite the now Minister for Home Affairs to attend those ceremonies. We do three a month in my electorate. They are asked to read his apology and a letter from him. We do this all year, but we have never seen the member for Dickson in our electorate. We apologise for him not attending three times a month. So I'm taking the opportunity today to invite the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Home Affairs to the electorate of Lalor so that they can say what they want to say in other states. Say them in Melbourne; say them in Lalor.
