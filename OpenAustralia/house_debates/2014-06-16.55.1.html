       <p>
        Last week I was pleased to be able to welcome the Treasurer to Reid when we visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        Research Institute at Concord Hospital to see firsthand the groundbreaking research that is being conducted at this facility. Our visit highlighted the remarkable world-class research that we are undertaking in Australia and the importance of appropriately supporting research centres like this. The incredible facility was established in 1998, with research commencing in 2000. The aim of the institute is to provide excellence and leadership in health and medical research and to improve the future health standards of our community. The ANZAC Research Institute has ageing as its unifying research theme and is the only major independent research institute—and that is hard to say—with ageing as a primary focus. I would like to thank Dr Tim Sinclair, the general manager of Concord Hospital; Dr Teresa Anderson, and of course Alice King—you cannot go anywhere at Concord Hospital without Alice being there.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of my community I would also like to thank all of the staff at the ANZAC Research Institute for the remarkable world-leading research that they are undertaking. I would particularly like to mention Professor Derek Hart—whom I had the honour of introducing the Treasurer to—and his team for the remarkable research that is being undertaken in the area of dendritic cells. I am immensely proud that this research institute is located within my electorate and I commend the work of all of the researchers at this institute to the House.
