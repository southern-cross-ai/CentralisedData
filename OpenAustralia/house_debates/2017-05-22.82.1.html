        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how third parties have responded to the government's investment in Australia's agricultural sector? How will this benefit communities all around Australia, and is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any threats to the agriculture sector?

          They get very excited when they hear from me! I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member has not been able to wipe the smile off his face since he heard about the Inland Rail, because it is vitally important for the development of our nation. We have been going around, seeing how people are endorsing this budget. We went up to Maryborough the other day with the member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
           Wide Bay
          </a>
          , and they were ecstatic about what is happening with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Bruce Highway
          </a>
          and how we continue to drive that investment up there. We went to Gracemere with the member for Capricornia and heard about the prices they are getting for cattle. They are very happy about that, and they are also very happy about the money on the table for Rookwood Weir, which the Labor Party up there does not seem to support, and the Labor Party down here does not seem to support it. We went to Casino with the member for Page. They are very happy about cattle prices. They are very happy about the Inland Rail and how it is going to take pressure off the highway. We went to Wodonga with Senator McKenzie. They are very happy about the Inland Rail. We went to Wauchope with the member for Lyne. They are very happy about the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Pacific Highway
          </a>
          upgrades and very happy about the Inland Rail taking pressure off the Pacific Highway. We went to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
           Port Macquarie
          </a>
          with the member for Cowper, and they are very happy about the budget. They like the budget. They like the instant asset write-off. We went to Calare, where will be a $4 billion regional investment corporation. They love that. It is going to be based in Orange. They like that. They are very happy about the budget. We went to Shepparton with the member for Murray. He is very happy about the instant asset write-off and very happy about the Inland Rail. We went to Mildura, to a farm field day. They love the Inland Rail. They love what we are doing with the instant asset write-off.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is not just them, because the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFF" rel="nofollow">
           NFF
          </a>
          said the Inland Rail is a real crown jewel of the budget for the farm sector. The New South Wales Farmers' Federation said it is ecstatic that the government has fully committed to build the Inland Rail. The Australasian Railway Association said the Inland Rail 'is fundamental to boosting rail freight'.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_National" rel="nofollow">
           Pacific National
          </a>
          said it is a real game changer.
         </p>
         <p>
          But it is not the only game changer around. There is another game changer over here, because who else likes our budget? The member for Grayndler likes our budget. He said it is a victory to be celebrated. Here he is, the member for Grayndler—the big easy. He is in there for a game change. The big easy is going to be like a big diesel-electric locomotive. Here he is—the big
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDA" rel="nofollow">
           DDA
          </a>
          40X, the 6,600-horsepower diesel-electric. And he is going to go straight past the member for Sydney, straight past the member for Watson and straight past the member for Rankin. And do you know where he is going to stop? He is going to stop at your station. He is going to stop in your chair. That is where the big easy is off to. He is going to stop in your chair—and you know it. Here he comes. Why don't you give him a question? Get him on his feet so we can hear from him. We have been hearing from him, because he is going around the press gallery like a big diesel electric locomotive. Here he comes!
