        I am delighted to inform the House that the Write for Reid competition, which I was pleased to introduce into my electorate last year, has again been a huge success and has quickly become a feature of the school year in Reid. This year's topic was 'I am grateful for …' and my office received a massive number of entries from primary schools across the electorate. The entries demonstrated the incredible talent of the students and the dedication of the numerous teachers in my local schools. The entries covered all manner of topics, with the students expressing gratitude for many things—most notably family, friends and the safe environment that Australia has been able to provide to them and to so many people from around the world.

        I was pleased to announce the winners during Literacy and Numeracy Week. This year the three winners wrote of three different aspects of Australian life. One wrote about their appreciation for their parents, another spoke of her gratitude for our medical professionals and the third winner spoke of her thanks for the basic ability to turn on the tap to obtain fresh water. To Megan Vu of St Mary's Catholic Primary School, to Layne Foo of Burwood Public School and to Iman Nelgabaz of Meriden junior school I say congratulations! I was thrilled to meet the talented writers last week over a morning tea in my office, along with their parents and teachers, who were understandably so proud. I thank all the students who took part in this inspiring competition and I am looking forward to reading next year's entries already.
