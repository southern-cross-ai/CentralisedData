       <p>
        Australia has one of the highest rates of domestic violence against women among developed countries. The Albanese Labor government is working tirelessly to address this, and today I want to acknowledge the work of grassroots organisations, particularly Didi Bahini Samaj Victoria. They play a pivotal role in our community and in my electorate of Wills. Didi Bahini Samaj is a critical lifeline for migrant Nepalese women facing the scourge of domestic violence. I recently met with the wonderful women who run this organisation, and I've supported them in their volunteer activities over time. These Australian Nepalese women, busy with their own families and their own jobs, still volunteer their time to provide vital services to migrant Nepalese women.
       </p>

        Didi Bahini Samaj serves as a crucial first point of contact for culturally sensitive support for women seeking assistance. Last year they assisted and referred on to relevant services over 75 women in critical situations. The journey of migrant women is often fraught with obstacles, including financial hardship, gender imbalance and cultural adaptation difficulty. Didi Bahini Samaj goes beyond just providing critical support; it also addresses and helps women overcome these obstacles. They are investing in the success of migrant Nepalese women through capacity building, social engagement, cultural celebration and advocacy. This organisation is completely volunteer run, and all their work is funded by small grants and donations. I really want to acknowledge in this place the work that they do.
