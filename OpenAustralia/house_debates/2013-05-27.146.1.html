        I rise to speak about the Gillard Labor government's plan for its so-called 'school improvement' and how this plan will not advantage 22 out of the 54 schools in my electorate. The Gillard Labor government tried to spruik its plan as the Gonski reforms, and now we learn that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gonski" rel="nofollow">
         David Gonski
        </a>
        is not very happy with what the Gillard Labor government is proposing. It is no longer called the Gonski plan; it is the National Plan for School Improvement. The Gonski report definitely did not advocate cutting funding to universities, so why is the Gillard Labor government doing this?
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians need to know that the Gillard Labor government is spending millions of dollars on new websites and advertising campaigns to try to sell its school plan. The plan is a $2.8 billion cut to education, bringing the total Commonwealth cuts or redirections in education to over $11 billion. Universities and students across the country are outraged at the cuts to university funding.

        , in my electorate, does not come away unscathed by the Gillard Labor government's harsh cuts.

        </a>
        -Chancellor of Charles Darwin University, Barney Glover, said in an email to all staff: 'The impact of these cuts is likely to total a decline in funding of around $14 million.' For 2014 alone
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU" rel="nofollow">
         CDU
        </a>
        will see a cut of around $1.4 million. Professor Glover is concerned about the financial burden and the impact that this will have at a time of strong growth for the university that for the next few years will be challenging for CDU.
       </p>

        Let us summarise: under Labor school funding is in decline. There is a clear choice between the coalition, which guarantees that no school will be worse off because we will keep the existing system at least until such time as we can have a consensus on the need for change, and the Gillard Labor government, which is cutting money out of schools. A close look at the budget over the forward estimates shows funding for schools goes down, not up as Labor claims. The Gillard Labor government said it is giving schools more money, when it is very mendacious of it to say that. It is cutting more than $300 million out of school funding over the next four years. It is clear that the only new or additional money for education comes from the states and territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate, 22 of the 54 schools will not be advantaged under this program. To take funding from urban schools across Darwin and Palmerston and redistribute it to remote schools is not fair, because the biggest issue facing remote

        </a>
        schools is getting kids to schools. The 22 schools that will not be advantaged in my electorate are: Alawa Primary School, Anula Primary School, Darwin High School, Jingili Primary School,

        , Sanderson Middle School, Stuart Park Primary School, Essington School Darwin, Wanguri Primary School, Woodroffe Primary School and Wulagi Primary School. It is interesting to note that a lot of these schools are in Territory Labor seats. As I said, these schools are not advantaged under the Gillard Labor government's current model. The

       </p>
       <p>
        For the record, the

        </a>
        average spend per student is about $15,600, which is well above the national average of $9,500 and the Gonski target of around $12,500 per student. The coalition welcomed the release of the Gonski report. We agreed with many of the findings and recommendations. However, it is important that the recommendations of the Gonski report are implemented in a cooperative and a careful way, ensuring that the original intentions are maintained as far as practicable. The coalition have our own education plan, and if elected we will seek agreement from all states and territories to improve educational outcomes for all schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, there is a clear choice between the coalition, which guarantees that no school will be worse off because we will keep the existing system at least until such time as we can have a consensus on the need for change, and the Gillard Labor government, which is cutting money out of schools. As a constituent said to me, come 14 September they hope that the Gillard Labor government is not returned.
