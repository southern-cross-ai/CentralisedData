        Reaching 100 years of age is an incredible milestone. In our roles as members of parliament, we often have the pleasure of meeting amazing people throughout our communities who have reached or exceeded a century of life. Today I want to highlight two who I have met in recent months, who both served our country in uniform.

        It was a great pleasure to be invited to attend a 100th birthday lunch for Ernie, born in 1920. Ernie trained as a fitter and turner in

        in 1941, finishing up as a chief petty officer. Ernie saw combat in the

        . They covered the area from the bottom of

        to India and

        . Later on they had a hand in the recapture of Okinawa in Japan. In 1944 Ernie received a commendation for removing a misfired round from one of the guns. It was a tense moment, where he cleared all personnel from the area to retrieve it and throw it overboard. After discharging from the navy in 1946, he worked at the sugar mills and contributed to the community for many decades, ultimately ending up in Townsville. At a birthday party surrounded by family and friends at the Cowboys Leagues Club, you wouldn't have known Ernie was anywhere near 100. He was extremely pleased when I presented him a birthday present: a signed bottle of wine from ScoMo. It wasn't too long until I was invited to another lunch with Ernie, this time at the

        was keen to recognise Ernie's 100th birthday milestone with a lunch at the Townsville Sub Branch, and gave him a special certificate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to another inspirational member of the Townsville community: 103-year-old Colin. He is a well-known

        </a>
        and in Borneo. It was a great honour to be invited by some of his closest friends for a special presentation. Colin had been nominated to receive one of the Australian government's medallions and certificates of commemoration. This has been a fantastic initiative to recognise the significance of the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, and is available to every living veteran of that conflict. Despite growing a bit old—he's now in high care—Colin was extremely pleased to have received the well-deserved token of appreciation, which he now displays proudly in his room next to a photo of him all dressed up wearing his many other medals. Townsville has many fantastic locals, and these two are true heroes of our community.
