        Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Deloitte WA share index, underpinned by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        mining companies, which fell 12.6 per cent in May, significantly more than any other major international share index. Does the Prime Minister accept that he was wrong when he claimed the supertax on mining had no impact on the share values of mining companies and on the retirement incomes of millions of Australians?

         I thank the member for Curtin for her question and I inform the House that I am advised that since the end of April the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         market has fallen by eight per cent, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         market by 6 per cent, the euro markets by five per cent,

          Hong Kong
         </a>
         by five per cent, Japan by nearly 11 per cent, and Australia has been down by just over six per cent. That is the first point.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         also go to the second point, which I partly referred to before: Australia’s resources stocks have been down over the same period by about five per cent. That is less than the overall
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
          ASX
         </a>
         . Let’s just be very clear about that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore—and I draw this to the honourable member’s attention, because facts are a problem when you are running a fear campaign—over the same period of time the Canadian resource stocks have been down by about six per cent and Australian stocks by five per cent. Can I just say to those opposite: I do not think there is a debate in Canada at the moment about tax reform in the mining industry. I would suggest to her that she actually pay attention to factual analysis of what is happening around the world. The member for

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister has just stated that one of the members of the opposition has sought to mislead the House. I think it would help the good order of this House if he withdrew that comment.

           Within the practices of the House, statements like that have been made. People with memories, who have been here quite a while, know that a substantive motion is required if other phrases are used.

             <p>
              Order! The Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance has helped me out because I was going to personalise it by saying a former Leader of the House should know that those who have been responsible on either side for the business would know that the practice of this House is that the expression ‘mislead’ is quite often used. It has been the practice of this House that, if the accusation has been that a member has deliberately misled the House, that requires a substantive motion. That is the way in which this House has conducted its business in the past. The Prime Minister has the call.

                   These are sort of factors that have been going on which are not at all related to the mining tax. And just to further push that point home, some of the shares of the big offshore mining companies such as Vale—

                     say therefore that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has sought to construct an argument based around the share market impact of mining stocks. Firstly, as far as the Australian index is concerned, it has generally performed better than most other comparable indexes. Secondly, in terms of our mining stocks, they have performed better than the Brazilian company Vale that I just referred to as well as the Canadian exchange, and I referred to those figures before.

                     It was very good to see the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out there engaged in her protest activities the other day in Perth. It was a bit a like protest by Prada I thought. You had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition out there campaigning hard in a designer type demonstration. It was good. It was effective. The message was heard clearly. But I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: don’t let the facts get in the road of a good fear campaign.
