        The government has already committed substantial funds in housing since being elected—billions of dollars. There is $10 billion still to be committed, but the Greens say, 'No, not by the hair of their chinny chin chin.'
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        are sitting there in their little house made of straw, wondering where all their mates are. Is anyone with them? The affordable housing organisations aren't there with them—they want the Housing Australia Future Fund passed. The charities want it passed. Builders want it passed. Unions want it passed. People out in the real world under housing stress want it passed. The state governments want it passed. Everyone in every city in Australia who see homeless people on the streets want it passed. Unless the Greens read the writing on the wall in their little straw house real soon, they're going to find out at the next election that a whole lot of other people who voted Greens at the last election want it passed to.

        I said there is no one else in the little straw house with the little pig, but that's not quite true. There's someone sitting quietly in the corner who does not look like another little pig. It looks like a little hairy wolf. The Greens are in the little straw house with the coalition. That should tell the Greens all they need to know about this bill. They are not in a safe place. Back in 2009 the Greens sacrificed the good for the perfect on climate change and they have had to wear that ever since. They are currently on the path of making history again for all the wrong reasons.
