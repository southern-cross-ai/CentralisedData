        The first Sunday in September celebrated the important role that fathers play in a person's life. Last Sunday, 3 September, was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Father's Day
        </a>
        . I want to thank all the fathers who celebrated on that day, and not just fathers but grandfathers, stepfathers and anyone else who steps up to fill the gap of a father. Thank you for all that you do for our nation's children. Being a father is not only a privilege but an honour. I took the time to listen to some dads in my electorate over the weekend and asked them what makes a good dad. As dads, we owe it to our children to shape their future as best we can. Dads in my electorate told me that their role was to 'teach their children to work hard and get ahead'. Andrew Reibelt from Rothwell told me that his dad was someone who 'always worked hard' and was 'always there for advice'. Andrew says that he has always tried to do the same thing for his kids. Bernard from

        told me, 'Time and engagement is what makes a good dad.'

        from Griffin says that it's important to lead by example. As a proud father of three sons myself, I know that being a dad isn't always easy, but it's an absolute privilege. I'd say to all fathers in Petrie and around Australia: Thank you for what you do. Continue to do your best. It's never too late to put in 100 per cent. Our children throughout the country need you. Well done. Continue to step up and get involved in their lives.
