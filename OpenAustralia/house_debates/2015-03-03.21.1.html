        I would like to thank Joe Coyte, manager of

        , Minister for Health, during the minister's recent visit to the Central Coast. The minister gladly accepted an invitation to tour the facility and to learn about the programs offered by Joe and his team.

        The Glen is a leading alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre for men.

       <p>
        I have been actively working with The Glen for a while and recently had the pleasure of announcing $157,000 of federal government funding to enable the construction of two new houses to accommodate participants in The Glen's rehabilitation programs. This funding will deliver 12 new beds as well as some much-needed building works, including plumbing, construction of footpaths, and landscaping. The Glen offers a long-term residential program based on the 12-step programs of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous" rel="nofollow">

        and

        </a>
        , with consistent and achievable outcomes. I am proud to say that, from 1 July 2015, there will be more beds at The Glen for men who suffer from substance abuse and associated issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Glen does tremendous work in our local community, and I was proud to showcase this outstanding facility to the Minister for Health, enabling her to experience their work firsthand. I also want to congratulate the local Bunnings store, who have worked in partnership with The Glen in offering these men opportunities to get back into employment. They are doing fantastic work, working with Bunnings. I also thank the corporate members, who have made more funding for The Glen possible. Thank you.
