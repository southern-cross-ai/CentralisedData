        I take this opportunity to congratulate the mighty
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_United" rel="nofollow">
         Lakes United
        </a>
        on an outstanding season. Yesterday Lakes capped a fantastic season with their victory in the Newcastle rugby league grand final. The game was close for the entire first half and a large part of the second half before Lakes were able to kick away to a comfortable 40-24 victory. Yesterday’s victory was Lakes’ first premiership since 2001. In addition to winning yesterday’s grand final, this year Lakes won the Super Sevens competition in Wagga, the Konami Pre-Season Cup and the major and minor Newcastle rugby league premierships. It is my understanding that it has been 20 years since any club has achieved this mammoth feat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lakes United is a club with a proud history and I am very proud of the club’s achievements both on and off the field. I particularly congratulate Ian Bourke, who coached the team as well as playing in it, and captain and five-eighth, Paul Skovgaard, on his great effort in the grand final and on winning

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate the Belmont Sporties Club for the role it played in the victory and the role it continues to play in supporting local sport. Congratulations, Lakes, and I hope that next year is as good as this year. You are great role models for the young people in Shortland.
