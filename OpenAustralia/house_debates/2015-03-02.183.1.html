       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to a great local hero,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Wilson
        </a>
        , who sadly passed away after a short illness. Phil dedicated an amazing 60 years of service to the Oakleigh District Football Club, starting with the under-16s in 1957, playing in the under-17s as seniors—both football and cricket—being a secretary of the juniors and the seniors, being a life member of the club in 1969, being a life member of the Federal Football League in 1981 and being on the club committee from 1968 to 2010—an amazing record.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phil passed away in relative comfort, I am advised by club stalwarts, with a small number of both his families—natural and club—in attendance. True to the end, he never complained or had a negative or bad word about anyone, or anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        His service was held in Oakleigh, of course, and was attended by approximately 350 people, many from the club and surrounding football leagues. I am advised that the wake was a massive affair, with everybody going back to the club. Phil's niece spoke of his love of family and the club and, as a bachelor, it was thought that he was more or less married to the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were also many people representing lots of clubs, the football community and the broader Oakleigh community where Phil is a legend. The club unveiled a photo along with his commemorative service record and a large sign renaming the bar as the Phil E Wilson Bar—a nice touch, and one I am sure Phil would appreciate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phil was a naturally shy and retiring type but we managed to have a service for him before he went so we could actually say these things to him in person. I want to say thank you to a tremendous member of our community for a life of service.
