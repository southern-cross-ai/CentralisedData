        Deputy Speaker Archer, you probably don't know this, but the member for Bennelong is also referred to often as 'the member for pill hill'. It's a name born from the number of pharmaceutical and medtech businesses that are established in Bennelong at

        . But I also think it reflects how our community is leading the way in embracing innovative medical technology and fostering a culture of health and wellbeing. I want to reflect on some of the great health-focused events that I've had the pleasure to take part in over the winter break.
       </p>
       <p>
        A standout event was the

        Patient Experience day, which brought together 12 patients, their loved ones, patient organisations and 120 local employees. This gathering, the second largest of its kind globally for Edwards Lifesciences, highlighted the profound impact of medical technology on patients who have had to deal with heart health. The day was filled with inspiring stories, particularly that of the current

        health secretary Susan Pearce. She shared her story, where she experienced a heart murmur and was saved because of this incredible technology. We also heard about Lachlan Drier's journey through multiple heart surgeries to become a success in rugby league. The dedication of everyone present to addressing structural heart disease was clearly evident, showcasing ongoing efforts to enhance their quality of life. Hearing their personal stories was truly moving.

        Soon after that I had the privilege of hosting the Minister for Health and Aged Care in Bennelong, where we toured some of our local health providers. Our visit began at the Midway Family Pharmacy, a cornerstone of our community's health care. We explored their role in the National Immunisation Program, which has significantly boosted vaccination rates by providing free vaccines directly through pharmacies in our community. This initiative has improved accessibility but has also reduced pressure on our local

        clinics. We also talked about the government's cheaper-medicines policy and workforce issues within the sector. I thank Tau and her team for giving us a moment in their busy day to provide feedback.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our discussions continued at the Maxim Street Health Hub, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ryde" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , where we engaged with local doctors on our plan to strengthen Medicare. The doctors shared valuable insights on the local implementation of these programs and the tangible benefits they observed. The tripling of the bulk-billing imitative and the rollout of our urgent care clinic were discussed. A constant theme emerged throughout our visitâ€”that is, the importance of listening to those directly involved in healthcare delivery when trying to strengthen Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        After 10 years of cuts to and neglect of our primary healthcare system, it is finally turning around. We're seeing green shoots in bulk-billing rates, and pharmacists are working towards a greater scope of practice. Both are good things. I thank the minister for his time and visit. I'm optimistic about the healthcare future we're helping create.
