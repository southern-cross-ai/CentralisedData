       <p>
        I want to press the urgency of having the live cattle trade to Indonesia resumed within days, not months. I commend the work that is already being undertaken by the government and the industry itself. After my briefing this morning I am encouraged to think that their work is being done, but it needs to be done quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        We support the ban on live cattle trade to facilities that fail to comply with acceptable animal welfare practices. But this blanket ban was announced without any prior consideration or consultation, and the damage that it has already inflicted on the Australian industry across the

        of Australia is now starting to impact in parts of southern Australia. This industry is worth $320 million annually. There are seven abattoir facilities which meet Australian standards and another 18 facilities in Indonesia which meet international standards for animal welfare practices. Getting these facilities accredited and back online must be an urgent priority in resuming trade. Prime Minister, this must not take longer than a few weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        With our world-class National Livestock Identification Scheme, one of the first in the world, we are able to track cattle from the paddock to the port and from the port to the feedlot in Indonesia and then on to the processor. This should be a required safeguard which ensures that our cattle are going only to accredited abattoirs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister, many families are relying on this trade for their income. The cattle are waiting on the docks, they are waiting in paddocks and they are waiting in holding yards, and this needs to be done quickly.
