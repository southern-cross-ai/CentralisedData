         <p>
          Mr Speaker, on indulgence, firstly in relation to the contribution to this parliament for over 37 years on the part of Ian Harris AO, can I on behalf of the government, and I believe on behalf of all members present, simply congratulate him on the absolute professionalism of his service. Today is not the day to go through a complete and exhaustive rendition of his career. But can I say that in his discharge of his responsibilities, in my experience as a backbencher, as a shadow minister and as leader of the Government, he has been impeccably professional—always courteous in his dealings with members and always insightful in terms of the advice that we have sought, particularly in terms of the interpretation of the standing orders and
          <i>
           Practice
          </i>
          and the procedures of this place. Ian, on behalf of all of us here and those who you have had to shepherd from absolute ignorance of the standing orders and procedures to partial familiarity, which I believe is the highest station any of us can aspire to in this place, I say thank you, and I say thank you sincerely on behalf of all government members.
         </p>
         <p>
          Following that, to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Wright" rel="nofollow">
           Bernard Wright
          </a>
          , can I just say that we are delighted by the decision concerning your appointment. Equally, in my experience you have served members of both sides of this chamber professionally and well over many years and, again, with a spirit of absolute courtesy and consistency. We wish you well in your future appointment and I believe this reflects well on the institution of the Australian parliament.

          <p>
           On indulgence, can I second the remarks of the Prime Minister and, on behalf of the opposition, thank Ian Harris for his 37 years of service. Ian, you have enlightened all of us through our many encounters and questions to you. You have left none of us any wiser but always much better informed. We are very grateful for that. Your service has been extraordinary and this place—the most important meeting place of the Australian people, where the laws and the government of this nation are decided—could not operate without your commitment, your professionalism and your integrity. We are forever indebted and the nation is forever indebted to you for your service.
          </p>
          <p>
           You have, of course, been served by an outstanding deputy in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Wright" rel="nofollow">
            Bernard Wright

           . Bernard’s service has also been outstanding. He has had a great mentor in you. Bernard, we are all delighted that you are stepping up to fill Ian’s shoes. You have been a wonderful team together and we know that his spirit and his values will guide you in the many years that you will be our Clerk. We congratulate you from our side of the House, and every member congratulates you on your appointment and thanks you for your service.

           <p>
            On indulgence, I briefly want to put on record, as Leader of the House, my appreciation for the work that Ian has done over 37 years. He joined the parliamentary staff back in 1972. He served as Deputy Clerk from 1991 and has been
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
             Clerk of the House
            </a>
            of Representatives since 27 July 1997. In all that time there would not be a member who has served in this House, and there have been many—many would wish that they had your longevity as members of this House—who would not have had contact with you and would not have respected your professionalism and the way in which you have conducted yourself, giving impartial advice and helping essentially to make this House run in the professional way in which it does. I pay tribute to you. I indicate to members that I have had a discussion with the Manager of Opposition Business and there will be a longer farewell for you, Ian, which you will have to sit through as the Clerk. That is a tribute to you, but it is not something that you would ask for because you have been very humble in the way that you have undertaken your duties.
           </p>

            </a>
            , I am very pleased in the wisdome of your elevation to Clerk. You have served the parliament with a great deal of distinction already. Now that you have risen to this senior position in the parliament it really is a great honour to you. I look forward to continuing to work with you in a constructive fashion.

I think that everybody in this place knows—and I think the public have a sneaking suspicion—that without the clerks of the House, the MPs and, dare I say it, speakers, deputy speakers and ministers, would not have any ability to convey that we know what we are doing without the advice that comes from the clerks every day.

               Without the clerks and without the deputy clerks we would be much the poorer in this place. They basically keep the show on the road. Many times we have all been in here scratching around for bits of paper to find what our instructions are, and the clerks are always able to provide us with that advice.

               I thank Ian Harris for the amazing service that he has given. I came here in 1993 at the tender age of 25 and I have asked him for advice on many occasions. I congratulate

                On indulgence, on behalf of the Independents I would like to associate them with the remarks that have been made in relation to Ian Harris. Ian, you have done an outstanding job. I think it is a reflection on how good a job you have done that they are going to replace you with your 2IC. I think that is a real reflection of the professional way in which you have conducted yourself. I am personally delighted that Bernard will be replacing you. I think he is an outstanding man. I would like to associate those remarks with the Independents and, also, the late

                 On indulgence, I join in the remarks of others to personally compliment Ian on his long service as

                 of Representatives. Fairly early in my parliamentary career I had the opportunity to travel overseas on a delegation with Ian and I got to know him very well, to like him personally and certainly to appreciate his great skills and the respect with which he is held around the world.

                 It has been something of a tradition in this parliament for the Deputy Clerk to succeed the Clerk. Bernard, I congratulate you wholeheartedly on continuing that tradition. It is not just a tradition; it is a well earned privilege. The reality is that there are few people, I think, who could come from outside into this parliament and do the kind of job that is expected of the Clerk. In reality it takes years of experience to have gone through the various elements and challenges that have to be addressed each day. I think there is therefore no other school anywhere that can equip somebody adequately to be the Clerk, other than to serve on the Clerk’s staff, particularly as Deputy Clerk. So, congratulations to you, Bernard. We wish you a very successful career in this position.

                   On indulgence, my period in the House is I think six months shorter than that of the Clerk—I was not going to equate it with his. In that time I have had the opportunity to observe the professionalism of both the Clerk and his Deputy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   One of the things that have not been observed by those taking part in this debate is the particular skill that the clerks bring to assisting with amendments to complex legislation. This is a role normally fulfilled by parliamentary counsel, yet the people who are working here for us, who are familiar with the processes of the parliament, have to be across the detail of legislation for which others specialise in order to be able to offer that skill and assistance. It is a special and unique task that they undertake. The work that they have done in supporting our relevant associations and the way in which they assist parliamentarians across the political divide is something for which we need to be particularly grateful and I wanted to take this opportunity to extend my personal thanks as well.

                    On indulgence, as a former Leader of the House I obviously echo and endorse the remarks made by others. Yes, Ian Harris is an extraordinarily professional person but the roots of that professionalism, if I may say so, lie in a great love of this parliament—an extraordinary love for this parliament. I suggest that perhaps there is no-one in this House who loves the institution of this parliament greater than our Clerk. I think we should acknowledge and nurture the love of the parliament which Ian Harris has displayed throughout his long career.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I also say that I think it is a worthy tradition that this position has invariably been filled by internal promotion. Love of this parliament is necessary for the clerkship to be well discharged. Love of this parliament is helped by familiarity with it—notwithstanding from time to time the delinquencies of its members. Nevertheless, I think it is a very worthy tradition that the clerkship of the House is filled by internal promotion and I would not like this to change.
