       <p>
        I had the pleasure of attending the Caloundra City Show at Maleny, on Friday, 2 June and Saturday, 3 June. Those who know the town of Maleny in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        hinterland appreciate that it is an area of lush green paddocks and rolling hills. Often, it has been known as ‘Constable country’. It is an area known for its dairy industry, although some farmers are now diversifying into other niche products, such as cheese made from goats’ milk, as well as wine. Many restaurants have opened, as well as craft shops, holiday cabins and so on. Maleny is a town which, despite the progress of the Sunshine Coast, has retained a country feel. Along with other hinterland towns such as Montville and Mapleton, it is popular with tourists who are keen to see the beautiful hinterland regions, including the many facilities offered by them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The annual show at Maleny retains this warm country feel, despite the fact that this year the winds picked up on Saturday and brought a brisk chill factor to the showgrounds. People commented to me that it was nothing that a dagwood dog smothered in tomato sauce could not fix. While at the show, I was able to catch up with those who organised the show, such as hard working president Ivan Hankinson and secretary Lyn Burgess. There are some 250 volunteers who make sure that the show is a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spent parts of two days at the event, so I was able to have a good look around, including at the dairy cattle, the ring events and the produce stalls, including the one run by Angelika Wicke-Duesing and her husband, who run Sunshine Farms. They make some of the tastiest relishes and sauces I have ever come across, all with natural ingredients and by hand. I want to congratulate the committee and the volunteers who helped to make the Caloundra City Show at Maleny a great success.

        and others. I also enjoyed meeting the National Party candidate for Glasshouse, Ken Piva, once again. He is a hard worker and dedicated to making a real difference for the people of the region. Despite the less than favourable media coverage at the time in relation to the proposed merger of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland—a merger which I supported and still do—the two parties once again shared booths at the show, and we were able to have a strong, favourable and united coalition presence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Caloundra City Show at Maleny is always enjoyable. It was again this year. The showgrounds were beautiful, there was wonderful hospitality, a tremendous climate and a large number of local participants. Many people travel from Brisbane and from other parts of the Sunshine Coast to enjoy the Caloundra City Show each year. I salute all of those who are responsible for making it such an outstanding success.
