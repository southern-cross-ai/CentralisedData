        There is nothing better in being a local MP than visiting schools and engaging with students from your electorate. I had that great pleasure again when I visited Pearcedale Primary School to speak to the grade 6 cohort and host a Q&amp;A with them. I was joined by the fantastic state member for Bass, Jordan Crugnale, and we made an effective team in answering all questions related to federal and state governments. There were some fantastic questions, ranging from how our great democracy works all the way through to individual issues and which level of government looks after what. In fact, last Wednesday the grade 6 cohort were here in Canberra for an educational tour on how our parliament works, so they were quite prepared with their questions. There are some rising stars in this year level and I am so excited to see what they will achieve in their final year of primary school and beyond.

        A big thank you to the school captains, Lucas, Ava, Hamish and Holly, for their warm welcome and for showing me their wonderful school. Once again, thank you to the principal,

        , and the teachers, for having me. I cannot wait to visit your school again. I thank the House.
