        —Brisbane Air Traffic Services Centre and Control Tower Complex Refurbishment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Airservices Australia is proposing to refurbish the existing air traffic services centre and control tower complex within the Brisbane air traffic services centre compound. This will deliver support facilities for the new civil and military air traffic management system. These works are integral milestones in the OneSKY Australia Program—a partnership between Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence to replace the current independent civil and Defence air traffic management systems with an advanced integrated system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works will provide fit-for-purpose facilities to support the initial and ongoing training of operational users and provide technical support throughout the life of the new air traffic management system. The estimated cost of the works is $35.7 million, excluding

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 1 December 2020. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approvals, the works are expected to commence in quarter 3 of 2021 and be completed in quarter 2 of 2022.

        On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.

        ) Airport Tower Refurbishment Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Airservices Australia is undertaking a national program to replace the current tower technology system air traffic controllers use to track and communicate with aircraft with an Integrated Tower Automation Suite—INTAS. The capacity and availability of the current electrical and mechanical services in the Sydney airport tower would not support the transition to INTAS. The proposed project involves a refurbishment and upgrade to extend the tower's design life and meet current building codes and standards; modernise and enhance the building's amenities; and enable the facility to support the transition to INTAS. The estimated cost of the works is $24.6 million, excluding GST.

Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is planned to commence as soon as possible and with an expected completion date of September 2022.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">

CSIRO is proposing to undertake refurbishment works at three of its four sites located in the Perth Precinct: Floreat, Kensington and Waterford. The works are consistent with CSIRO's 2019-29 Property Strategy, which seeks to align CSIRO's property footprint with the future needs of the organisation, improve utilisation of property and maximise investment of limited funds in key sites. The estimated costs of the works is $19 million, excluding GST.
