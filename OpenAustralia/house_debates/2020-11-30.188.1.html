        Upgrades to the Terrigal Trojans clubhouse have now been completed. The project was partly funded by a $275,000 grant through the National Stronger Regions Fund, and the clubhouse was refurbished with the help of a whole group of volunteers, business owners and local tradespeople. Improvements include a new separate function room, outdoor terrace, eating area, two bars and kitchen. I've got no doubt that this popular facility will bring even more opportunities to our region, not only for sport but also for functions and community events right in the heart of Terrigal. I recently joined some of the club's talented players and executives to hear about what this meant for amateur sports on the

        . The captain of the first-grade team, Sam Kenny, said that the new clubhouse had created a real sense of community and will help attract even more young players. He said it was great to have space for club memorabilia to showcase the many fantastic achievements of fellow team mates.

        , president of the Trojans rugby club, said that the upgrade was possible with the dedication of club members and local supporters. Local businesses worked free of charge or at heavily discounted rates to help transform the building, providing services and materials like roof sheeting, gyprocking and structural beams. He put it perfectly when he said that the clubhouse was built by the community for the community. To John Stevens, the Terrigal Rugby Club—the Trojans—and everyone involved in creating this fantastic facility for our community to gather, enjoy and call their own, I say thank you.
