        Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I'm sure that this will be close , and near and dear , to your heart . This is about regional kids having a crack, regional kids who are successful, r egional kids who I think will be the absolute apple of their parents' eye . The ir school s are proud of them, their state is proud of them and their nation is proud of them. I'm talking about three y ear 11 students from the Bundaberg State High School who were selected to take part in the

        . For those who might not know, that's for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" rel="nofollow">
         NASA
        </a>
        , that big organisation that does all sorts of wonderful things and is cutting edge in terms of its design. Brooklyn Davis , Kasey Chandler and Alex Buck holz are our three local champions who travel led to

       </p>
       <p>
        This competition started in 1983 and was supported by NASA , of course . It targets high - school students and recreates the experience of working on an aerospace company's proposal team. The teams are asked to envision space colonies in accordance with an

        , which is a request for proposal. An RFP is used where the request requires technical expertise or specialise d capability , or where the product or service being requested does not yet exist and the proposal may require research and development to create whatever is being created.

        A very proud teacher, Keith Holledge , the head of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Industrial Technology
        </a>
        and Design at Bundaberg State High School , has been there inspiring th ese types of students for at least 25 years. He's a former woodworker. He's been involved in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        programs since 1990 . In fact, he started the CO 2 —carbon dioxide— dragster cars 35 years ago. He secure d a $330,000 grant to supply a state - of - the - art computer-aided design facility in 2004 , and became involved in the Australian Space Design Competition 14 years ago. Mr Holledge, as I said, is a very proud teacher. What did he have to say about his students? He said :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Their dreams will become our reality. Our kids are the ones who will be fixing all our problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that's a great quote. It's a great reflection on th os e kids who are coming from regional Australia, who are coming from regional towns like Bundaberg and like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, who are out there having a crack. They're doing really well in science , technology, engineering and mathematics — and they find themselves at NASA. We couldn't be prouder, and I think everyone is parliament should be proud of that type of performance. It couldn't happen without help, and sponsors included

       </p>
       <p>
        Quite simply, this is about regional kids having a go and being successful. We should support that type of success at every single opportunity. Let's talk about the good things in our regions: o ur kids who are out there trying hard. I think this is a great reflection on all of us , and I congratulate them on their success.
