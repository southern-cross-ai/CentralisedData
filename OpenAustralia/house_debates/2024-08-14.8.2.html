        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's
        <i>
         Report 218: Fiji status of forces; UK accession CPTPP; IPEF;
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILO" rel="nofollow">

        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I'm pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties'
        <i>
         Report 218: Fiji status of forces; UK accession CPTPP; IPEF; ILO 191
        </i>
        . The report focuses on the JSCOT inquiries into four major treaty actions: the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Fiji on Cooperation in the Field of Defence and the Status of Visiting Forces; the Protocol on the Accession of the United Kingdom of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" rel="nofollow">
         Great Britain
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and associated side-letters; the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity Agreement relating to Supply Chain Resilience; and, finally, the International Labour Organization Convention No. 191: Safe and Healthy Working Environment (Consequential Amendments) Convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Fiji status of forces treaty builds on Australia's mutually beneficial relationship with Fiji through enabling more frequent and sophisticated defence cooperation between the two countries. This agreement enables Australia and Fiji to work together on maritime security issues, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, peacekeeping operations, co-deployments, and training of military personnel. At a public hearing, issues relating to the defence relationship between Fiji and Australia, the relationship between this agreement and other agreements between the two countries, sovereignty, human rights, and territorial integrity were raised, with the committee satisfied that these issues have been addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        accession to the CPTPP treaty enables the UK to accede to one of the world's most comprehensive free trade agreements. As Australia already has a strong free trade agreement with the UK, this treaty provides modest gains to Australia, but further strengthens the relationship between the two countries. After hearing about issues related to the value of the CPTPP, services, supply chain benefits, professional mobility and strategic benefits, the committee believes that the UK accession to the CPTPP is in the national interests of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IPEF aims to enhance the collaboration to prevent, mitigate and prepare for supply chain disruptions within the Indo-Pacific. The agreement increases Australia's supply chain resilience by establishing international policy levers, sending market signals on diversification, promoting an international evidence based approach, and ensuring a systemic and coordinated approach to disruptions. Having experienced the impact of supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee is supportive of the IPEF's collaborative approach to the minimisation of future vulnerabilities and mitigation of potential risks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final treaty before us is the ILO 191, which amends the ILO conventions and protocols to ensure the right to a safe and healthy work environment is reflected in existing ILO instruments. The ILO 191 demonstrates Australia's commitment to workplace health and safety as a fundamental principle and right at work. Australia has a strong reputation within the Asia-Pacific with respect to supporting and advocating for workplace health and safety matters, and ratifying this treaty ensures that our reputation is maintained. The committee supports majority treaty action considered in the report and recommends that binding treaty action be taken. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.
