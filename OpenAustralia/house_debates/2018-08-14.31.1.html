        As you know, Mr Speaker, there was today in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        a very important—portentous, in fact—meeting. It was a meeting that might have set out Australia's future, the sort of country we're going to leave for our grandchildren. Rumour has it that there were some contrary voices coalescing around the member for Warringah; however, at the barbecue for the Australian head of state that I'm talking about, this was not raised. I'd like to acknowledge the member for Mackellar, the member for

        , and Senator Richard Di Natale, who organised this barbecue for an Australian head of state. It was well supported by Senator Singh. Many others turned up to support the idea of us having an Australian head of state.

        I've been handing out portraits of our head of state to many people recently, including to some republicans, young republicans, who, when I asked about why they were there to get the portrait, said they did want an Australian head of state. Surely it's time for the Prime Minister to dig out those playing boots from 1999 for one last season, one last chance to have a crack at getting an Australian head of state. Surely we can't ever reconcile our past until we are truly confident about our identity and our maturity as an independent nation, and have an Australian head of state. As
