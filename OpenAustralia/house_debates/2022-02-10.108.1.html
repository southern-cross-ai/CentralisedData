        Since I commenced my telco campaign last year, I've heard from hundreds of people across my electorate and around Australia who face the same problems caused by inadequate service by big telco. Today I'd like to share some of their stories with the House.

It's a total nightmare in which I have to climb a mountain, literally with laptop in hand, to speak to anyone. When the internet is off, 50 per cent of the time I have no television, no phone service, nothing. I have a battery-operated radio that occasionally picks up the ABC. I'm 68-years-of-age and live alone, and my children are really worried that, if I had a fall, there's no way I could let anyone know until I died. I live literally 10 kilometres from the CBD.

        swell the numbers of people using the system, and the system can't copeâ€”to the point that a signal is almost non-existent. This is a dangerous situation, as in an emergency situation we're unable to call emergency services. Landline for those have it is also unreliable, and we've had times when that also goes out for up to three days. This is a topic of many conversations in our community. We feel let down by many parts of the system.'

        There are frequent interruptions to our electricity supply, which means we and our neighbours are left without a landline as well and therefore have no access to emergency help during that time.

        Our internet connection is the old-fashioned copper kind, although the myriad of new estates being built all around us have access to both proper mobile reception and fibre technology internet to their houses.

        I've contacted them on numerous occasions which has resulted in a $50 credit and quote for over $2,000 to install a 4G repeater antenna as there are no plans for Telstra to invest in additional infrastructure in our suburb.

        I end up receiving missed calls often hours later and need to stand outside to return calls meaning I can't work on my computer at the same time which is completely impractical.

        These stories, and so many more, indicate why we need urgent telco reform in this country. In the peri-urban areas of Australia, in the regions and in remote Australia telecommunications should be a service Australians can rely on. But big telco seems to be alone among the service providers that provide services to Australians in taking money from Australians and failing to deliver a service again and again and again. This is why I've been working hard with colleagues on seeking to reform telecommunications, and it's a campaign I'm not going to give up on.
