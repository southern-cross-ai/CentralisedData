       <p>
        Last week in parliament I had the great opportunity, like many, to meet with a group of young carers. They were here with Carers Australia to share their experience of what it means to be a young carer. Breanna, from my electorate, was part of the delegation, and to meet with Breanna in this place, share her experiences and understand the challenges that she faces being a young carer was instrumental. It really taught me a lot about what she is going through and the challenges that she faces being a young woman caring for her mother. Breanna and the other women who were with her sharing their experiences talked about how hard it was in schoolâ€”having teachers understand that they were not at school today not because they were lazy or had skipped school but because they needed to take mum to an appointment because mum had had a turn. This is one of the things that these young people are dealing with day to day.
       </p>
       <p>
        We quite often hear in this House about older carers and the work that they do in their communities and to ensure that people within their families receive support. It is important that we also remember the challenges facing our young carers and the fact that they are trying to navigate a tough period of their life and, at the same time, care for someone in their family. Usually it is one of their parents. One of the challenges that they mentioned, apart from trying to navigate school, was finding a job where the employer also understood the challenges that they face as young carers and having that flexibility in the workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Breanna said that she is quite fortunate because she has chosen a career in social work. She has chosen a career in youth support where her employer understands that there needs to be that flexibility. But one of the other young carers said that her dream is to go into the police force, and she is concerned that that may be a bit of a challenge in terms of working formally for the police force. Would there be that same flexibility and understanding? It is unusual when someone who is 16 or 20 says to their employer or school, 'I need time off, because I've got to help mum. I've got to get mum to the appointment. I've got to be there at home.' It is different but it does not mean that they do not deserve support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Breanna and I have decided that we are going to get together in Bendigo and form a local support group for young carers in Bendigo not only so that they have a forum to share their experiences and support one another but also to give me an idea about what is going to help improve their lives and what support they need from their government. I look forward to sharing their ideas with this parliament after the group has been formed.
