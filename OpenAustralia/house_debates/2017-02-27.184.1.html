        Yet again I need to put on the record that Tasmania has felt the brunt of the government's Medicare bulk-billing freeze. There were over 383,000 fewer visits with bulk-scheduled fees across the country in the last six months along. Tasmania is the hardest hit, with bulk-billing for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s dropping nearly two per cent in that period, from 76.4 per cent to 74.5 per cent, the lowest in the country. As a result of the government's cuts, Tasmanians are paying more and more out of their own pocket for their own health care. This is in a state with an increasing ageing population and with people who are generally lower paid and simply cannot afford to cover the extra cost needed to see a doctor.

        GPs across the country are reeling from the open attack on general practice. The Royal Australian College of

         General Practitioners

        in a letter to me recently said, 'Nowhere is this being felt more acutely than in the northern suburbs of Hobart and in the north-west of Tasmania,' in my electorate, where for the first time in memory struggling patients are being asked to pay out-of-pocket expenses for GP visits. As recently as October, the AMA warned that this would happen with AMA Vice President Dr Tony Bartone saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The freeze is an enormous burden … on GPs.
       </p>
       <p>
        and

       <p class="italic">
        Practices cannot continue absorbing the increasing costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many patients will pay more to see their doctor because of the Medicare freeze.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, it seems his predictions have come true. The reality is that these cuts are hurting—.
