        Like so many Australians, I was greatly saddened to learn of the death of my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bailey" rel="nofollow">

        . He was so much more than just a fixture on the nightly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . As he appeared each night to tell us what the weather had in store, he was a reassuring presence, someone you just knew was a decent man. Along the way he shared his wisdom as a journalism lecturer. He fulfilled another of his passions as chairman of

        </a>
        . He was the chair of Wests Ashfield, a club that has contributed, under his leadership, literally millions of dollars over the years to community based organisations and to schools in the local area, including

        in the 2007 election. It was a noble cause. Mike got a respectable swing but not enough, and that's a pity because he would've been a wonderful addition to this place. He was a gentleman, a mentor, a friend. He was loyal, generous, warm hearted, funny and wise. He was a wonderful broadcaster. I am so sorry that he has left us today. On behalf of the

        and, I'm sure, the whole parliament, I offer my condolences to Mike's wife, Helena, and their son, Michael. May he rest in peace.
