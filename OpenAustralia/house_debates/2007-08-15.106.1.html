        I recently had the honour of proposing a toast to

        -Currumbin Lions Club. In proposing the toast, I was able to pay tribute to an international organisation that continues to serve communities throughout the world and, of course, to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Melvin Jones

        , the man whose dream was to have businesspeople work for the betterment of their communities and the world at large.

         Mr Jones

        , with the support of his own local business group, explored his concept at an organisational meeting in 1917. Twelve men gathered at that meeting and voted the Association of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs

        into existence. They issued a call for a national convention to be held in Dallas, Texas, in October 1917. Thirty-six delegates, representing 22 clubs, heeded the call and elected Dr William P Woods of Indiana as their first president. Melvin Jones, the man whose dream it was to form an international organisation, was named acting secretary, thus beginning his association with Lions that ended only when he passed away in 1961. That was the beginning—a modest beginning that was the foundation for Lions clubs to grow and serve communities throughout the world.

        The motto of Lions clubs is, ‘We serve’. That motto represents the community service that Palm Beach-Currumbin Lions Club has given over the past 50 years. Our local communities have been enriched with so many projects undertaken by this wonderful club. Palm Beach-Currumbin Lions has demonstrated great dedication to community causes by contributing both financially and in kind to many worthwhile groups and initiatives. Proceeds from the club’s fundraising activities have provided valuable assistance to charitable bodies at regional and national level as well as enabling the purchase of equipment for local hospitals and organisations. Members have volunteered their time and expertise to conservation projects and the construction of school and community facilities. They have also offered emotional, material and financial support to those affected by illness and natural disasters.

        It was a wonderful evening of celebration. A charter member, Mr Bill Freeman, and his wife, Lesley, were in attendance. Bill is still an active member of the club today. The current president, Mr Brian Mattingly, and his wife, Joy, who is the Lioness president, were also there.

        for the night Mr Merv Rose was accompanied by his wife, Jean. Also attending were Lion Terry Gunton and his wife, Lorraine, and Lion Don McHenry and his wife, Lois. The immediate past president, Ewen Munro, unfortunately was in hospital but was represented by his wife, Cynthia. Past president Lion Kevin Foster and his wife, Lyn, past president

        and his wife, Joy, Lion Keith Fleming and his wife, Ruth, and Lion Craig Dick and his wife, Joanne, were also there. Lion Harvey Crooks, who does a magnificent job every year organising the Lions Youth of the Year contest, also attended. There is not the time today to recognise everyone who attended, but they know who they are, they know what they have achieved as a club, and I know they will continue to work hard in our local community supporting charitable groups and those in need for another 50 years. Congratulations, Palm Beach-Currumbin Lions on a wonderful 50 years!
