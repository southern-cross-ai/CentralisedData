       <p>
        Last week, I had the privilege of setting sail with the youth crew of the
        <i>
         Young Endeavour
        </i>
        after they had docked at Seaworks in my electorate of Williamstown during its circumnavigation of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since it was gifted to the youth of Australia in 1988, the
        <i>
         Young Endeavour
        </i>
        has sailed on 558 voyages and has been crewed by 13,509 16- to 23-year-old Australians at sea for around 11 days a stretch. A partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        , the Young Endeavour Youth Scheme is focused on increasing self awareness, developing teamwork and leadership skills and creating a strong sense of community responsibility amongst the members of the youth crew.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was certainly impressed at the extraordinary capability that young Australians had shown and developed over just a 10-day period at sea. I spent some time on the day hauling ropes on the deck so that we could set sail, and I can say that it was not easy work and nor was it simple work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Martin Radunz for his help in organising a fantastic day, and also a big thank you to Lieutenant Commander Gavin Dawe, or 'Captain Gav';
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Moss" rel="nofollow">

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Director
        </a>
        of the
        <i>
         Young Endeavour
        </i>
        , and all the brilliant
        <i>
         Young Endeavour
        </i>
        crew who showed me the ropes, like Deborah from Melbourne and Lisa from Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the difficult physical and mental challenges of the trip—seasickness is an obligatory part of the trip, I am told—neither Deborah, Lisa nor any of the
        <i>
         Young Endeavour
        </i>
        crew wanted their voyages to end. This is a sentiment that I can completely understand after having spent such an enjoyable day in their company. I hope that the
        <i>
         Young Endeavour
        </i>
        continues to sail around Australia for many thousands of voyages to come.
