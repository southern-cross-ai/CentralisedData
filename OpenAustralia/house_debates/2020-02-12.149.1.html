        Today I'd like to reflect on some of the challenges that Australia faces, but do this within the context of a reflection on what makes Australia prosperous and resilient. We began this year in the throes of a devastating fire season, which saw the deaths of 33 people, the loss of almost 3,000 homes and the destruction of almost 10 million hectares of land. We've also been responding to a global health emergency and, of course, ever shifting geopolitical challenges. But I remain completely confident that Australia and Australians will effectively manage these challenges and more. It's in our

        </a>
        to fight and to win. And we do this best when we do it together.

        , I attended my first citizenship ceremony, including award ceremony, as a member of parliament. Before it kicked off, I was talking to a couple of Irish, now Australian, brothers, Mick and Oliver. Mick was saying to me, 'Wow, Vince, I cannot fathom how much effort everyone has gone to here.' For those 240 new citizens there was a huge marquee, live music, food and, of course, some speeches. In total, these new citizens came from 60 different countries, and we welcomed them all with open arms.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was joined there by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Irwin" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , other councillors and state members of parliament. As a wonderful example to those new Australians, award winners were presented on stage with their awards. A 2020 Australia Day ambassador, Jenny Lam, gave the keynote address. Jenny is a Vietnamese-born migrant who was a contestant on 2018
        <i>

        </i>
        and who went on to open her own Vietnamese street food restaurant. Jenny shared with us her experience, and it wasn't all smooth sailing as she tried to succeed here in Australia and ensure that her business became profitable. At one stage, Jenny said, she broke down in tears. She cried and she said to her mother, 'Mum, it's so hard. I can't seem to make it work; I'm thinking of giving up.' Well, Jenny's mum—who was also there listening in to the speech—she yelled at Jenny. She said, 'You stop crying. You get out there, and you make it work.' Jenny's mum told Jenny that her parents had it far harder in Vietnam, and then as new migrants—even going as far as to threaten to disown Jenny if she did give up. Talk about tough love! Jenny credits her mother with turning things around—with giving her the inspiration and giving her the comfort that in Australia perseverance is rewarded with prosperity.

        The Senior Community Citizen of the Year was Rae Kolb. I know Rae very well. She runs the Stirling Natural Environment Coastcare. Their mission is to replace weed vegetation with Indigenous vegetation to stabilise the dunes and to improve beach access and safety. I've physically supported Rae and the team on the ground, helping pull out invasive weeds, so I know they do a great job. The Young Community Citizen of the Year, Naomi Blitz, has been a key stakeholder in the City of Stirling's youth framework, helping develop the strategy for events, including the

        , play basketball and have a surfing competition and a skating competition. The Community Citizen of the Year went to Ken Shorto. Ken has been instrumental in Fee Free Football at Balga Soccer Club. This involves parents donating their time in lieu of paying fees and has been a great win for the club. Noongar elder, and my great friend, Len Yarran, representing the Wajuk people, provided a beautiful welcome to country. Len made the case that, whatever the future holds, it's important that, as Australians, we walk the path together. I called on all those new citizens present to do the same, to volunteer, whether it's at the local sports club or anywhere else, and to walk together for the benefit of all Australians.
