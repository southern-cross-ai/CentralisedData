       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill seeks to appropriate from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        for the purposes of making the COVID-19 disaster payment in the 2021-22 financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recurring outbreaks of COVID-19 and subsequent state government 'lockdowns' have meant that many people have not been able to get to work and earn an income due to stay-at-home orders. The government is committed to supporting Australians impacted economically by COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        The COVID-19 disaster payment is a one-off, time limited payment for eligible individuals who are unable to work and earn an income in an area under a state public health order for a 'lockdown' that lasts longer than seven days and that has also been determined to be a Commonwealth hotspot.
       </p>
       <p>
        The payment is delivered by Services Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The granted claims for the payment are currently being paid out of an annual appropriation. This bill seeks to make a special appropriation available to pay eligible claims for the payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        A special appropriation is the most suitable mechanism to fund the payment as it is a demand driven program where it is difficult to quantify how many people will be eligible as a person's unique circumstances will determine if they meet the criteria. While the situation in Melbourne continues to improve and they are thankfully no longer in lockdown, there is no knowing when Victoria or another state might need to use lockdown measures in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        This means that expenditure associated with the COVID-19 disaster payment cannot be reliably predicted for the purpose of an annual appropriation. Introducing a special appropriation means that the government has secure funding for all people who qualify for the COVID-19 disaster payment should we need to use it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also provides that the National Recovery and Resilience Agency will report on the COVID-19 disaster payment in their annual report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians are resilient and will do what needs to be done in terms of abiding by public health orders. Sometimes that comes at a personal financial cost. The COVID-19 disaster payment and the pandemic leave disaster payment are there to support those who need it the most.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
