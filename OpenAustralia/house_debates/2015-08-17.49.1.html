        The Master Builders' awards may well have been held in Hobart on Saturday night, but the winners were from the north-west and the electorate of Braddon. How those Hobartians are feeling today, I am not sure! Those from the north-west have been rightly recognised for striving for excellence and producing stunning homes and commercial buildings. There are businesses like Mead Con, which took out the heritage listed or period building project award for its magnificent work on the iconic Pumphouse Point; Fairbrother Construction, which won the new construction of over $50 million award for the magnificent new Lion cheese factory plant in Burnie; Robert Rimmelzwaan and R&amp;D Homes won the dwelling construction over $1 million award; Davies Construction won the dwelling constructions between $250,000 and $350,000 award; and

        </a>
        Building Contractors' Jason Overton won the excellence in medium density award. By the way, that particular company has done work for me and they are an excellent company. Fairbrother also took out the commercial builder of the year award.

        What is the most notable here, apart from the superior workmanship and excellence in the projects themselves, is that while the businesses may be based on the north-west, the projects are from throughout the state and in many cases they are buildings on the mainland. No doubt, the large construction businesses in the Hobart would like to see their own winning these awards. These people engender everything north-west businesses seek to achieve.
