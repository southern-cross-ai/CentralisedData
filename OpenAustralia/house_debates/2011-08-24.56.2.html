       <p class="italic">
        (a) excludes smaller and new apparel manufacturers who cannot afford to pay the annual fee from the market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) increases costs for clubs and players as licensed suppliers pass on the cost of the licence fee and the 'Q Logo' to consumers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) forces clubs to purchase what some regard as inferior and expensive products as Football Queensland strictly enforces penalties against clubs that wear apparel from non-licensed suppliers in competitive matches;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) increases cost for regional clubs as manufacturers large enough to pay the licensing fee are based in the large population centres, not in the regions; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) protects licensed suppliers form true competition as there is only a limited number of licensed suppliers and most are aware of each others prices;

         ACCC

        (3) calls on the ACCC to consider the anti-competitive nature of the Football Queensland licensing scheme when deciding on the continuation of the immunity from prosecution granted to Football Queensland; and

       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges that Football Queensland and other similar organisations have special exemptions and conditions in relation to their status in their community and as a consequence also carry special responsibility and duty of care in the exercise of its charter for clubs and players, as well as its commercial relationships.
