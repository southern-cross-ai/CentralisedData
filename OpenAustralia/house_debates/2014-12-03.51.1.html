       <p>
        I am very pleased that the federal government's Long Day Care Professional Development Program will support 44 long-day-care services in Durack to help with upskilling their educators and to meet the outcomes of the National Quality Framework. Recently I visited Bernice

        Early Learning Centre in Exmouth, which has 24 places. The four excited staff members were thrilled to be notified of the program funding and on learning the news began a training needs analysis to develop individual work plans. Director Caroline McGarry was sponsored on a 457 visa in 2012 and has worked for the service in Paraburdoo and now in Exmouth.

        , the service's regional manager, visits Exmouth monthly to provide support and supervision. Kim overseas other services that all receive this funding as well, including centres in Derby, Pannawonica, Onslow and

        . Bernice McLeod received an Exceeding rating in the national assessment. The service excelled in the areas of relationships with children and collaborative partnerships with families and communities. Bernice McLeod is proud to be part of the Exmouth community and works with the school, toy library and local playgroups. The staff are looking forward to building on their professional development and training as a result of the federal funding. I am particularly delighted they have received this funding and know that they will use the money wisely to build their skills and careers for the benefit of the children of Exmouth.
