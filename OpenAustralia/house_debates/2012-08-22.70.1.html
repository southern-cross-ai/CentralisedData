        My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services, Indigenous Affairs and Disability Reform. Will the minister update the House on how the government is supporting families around the country. Minister, what risks are there to this support?

         I thank the member for Fowler very much for his question and for all the work he does for the families in his electorate. He knows this Labor government has a very strong record in delivering for Australian families. Most recently we have delivered millions of household assistance payments to families around the country. Next year there is more to come. There will be the Schoolkids Bonus at the start and in the middle of next year. Also in the middle of next year there will be further increases in family payments to help those families make ends meet.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we know now is that the Leader of the Opposition and all these Liberals over there have got a secret plan to cut this support to Australian families. All of us read—

           What we know is that this Leader of the Opposition wants to outsource support for families and outsource support for people with disabilities to his mates in the states that have now got a very clear record of slashing and burning support for families. What we can see is that in Victoria, in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           and in Queensland families are losing support for playgroups, losing support for disability services and losing family payment support. If you look at what has happened in Victoria, the Victorian government cut the School Start Bonus so that 40,000 low-income families lost support because of the Victorian government's budget change.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
            The Liberals
           </a>
           in Queensland are up to it every single day of the week. The Liberals in Queensland have cut the extra support to people with disability. They have cut support to domestic violence services. They have cut support to tenancy advice services and, just today, they slashed Queensland's child protection watchdog.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is the latest effort from the

                I thank the member for Fowler very much for this question. This government is delivering to people in his electorate, who we know are having a lot of trouble making ends meet. I can inform the member for Fowler that, in his electorate alone, 63,000 people have received household assistance support from this government in the last few months—families, pensioners and others who need that support. And we know that all of them will face having that clawed back by the Leader of the Opposition.

               <p>
                We also know that people in the electorate of Fowler fear not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the Premier of

                 New South Wales
                </a>
                , who has decided to claw back some of this money and hike up public housing rents because he wants to take the money out the pockets of families, out of the pockets of pensioners, to fill his budget black hole, just like the Leader of the Opposition will.
