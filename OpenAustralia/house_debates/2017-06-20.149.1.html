        From simple and humble beginnings, meeting in a room provided by

        </a>
        , a small group of Greek immigrants with big dreams and a willingness to work hard laid the foundations for the very vibrant
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">

        community in the Liverpool region. Recently I had the honour of attending the 50th anniversary of Saints Raphael, Nicholas and Irene
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox Church
        </a>
        and Parish in Liverpool. His Excellency Archbishop Stylianos, the Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of Australia, attended, along with members of parliament, community leaders and a few hundred parishioners of the Greek Orthodox Church.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event also commemorated 50 years since the ordination of parish priest Father Christos Vergos and also marked his retirement. Father Chris was ordained two weeks before the establishment of the new parish in Liverpool, so his involvement has not only been in serving the spiritual needs of the Greek community but also in building a parish from the ground up. Father Chris is well known in the region, not just among the Greek community, through his charitable works and care of people. This is a man that has made a genuine difference for the better in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The anniversary dinner was also an opportunity for me to acknowledge the great contribution Australian Greeks have made to this nation. The Australian Greek community have shaped the very fabric of our nation through their spirit and the values of their Hellenic ancestry. They have worked hard to build their dreams of a better life for themselves and their families and have contributed in all areas of community life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success of Father Chris's work in promoting the Greek language and, indeed, the Greek heritage amongst younger people will stand as a lasting tribute to his ministry. On behalf of the community, I thank Father Chris and his wife, Sophia, for their years of service and wish them all the best in their retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this opportunity to welcome Father Dimitrios Papaikonomou, who will take over as the parish priest of Saints Raphael, Nicholas and Irene, and his family. Clearly Father Dimitrios has very big shoes to fill, but I am sure that, with the support of his family and the Greek community of Liverpool, he will continue in the same caring way as Father Christos Vergos has for the last 50 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the parish president, John Rekouniotis, and the directors for their kind invitation and for allowing me to participate in this milestone event in our community.
