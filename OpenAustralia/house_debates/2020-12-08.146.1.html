        On 3 December we recognised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with Disability. This is a day dedicated to promoting and acknowledging the achievements and contributions of those living with a disability not only in Australia but across the world. Around 4.4 million Australians live with a disability. Globally the number is around one billion, or 15 per cent of the world's population. It is an unenviable statistic but, sadly, my state of Tasmania has the highest rate of disability in the nation, at 26 per cent. The national average is 18 per cent. Around one-third of these people have a profound or severe disability. It doesn't matter whether you live in the city or the bush: most households would have a significant connection with somebody with a disability. International Day of People with Disability is a day to celebrate how far we have come in what we have accomplished together.
       </p>
       <p>
        July this year marked the completion of the staged rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . Since the implementation of the program, more than 364,000 people have benefited from the scheme, with 154,000 of those receiving disability related supports for the first time. That is, the NDIS has reached its full rollout milestone. No matter where you live across the north west, the west coast and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        in Tasmania, the program is available to you to support your needs and the choices that you make in your life. Across the electorate of Braddon, more than 2,200 participants have accessed the NDIS. I encourage anyone with a disability who is eligible to access support but has not done so—or their carers—to consider applying forthwith.
       </p>
       <p>
        International Day of People with Disability is also a time to look forward, a time to celebrate diversity and a time to acknowledge that we must never cease our campaign to move towards an inclusive society that values and respects all people as equal and contributing members of our community. Until everyone in our society is equally defined by what they can do, rather than what they can't do, that job is not done. That job is not done until people living with a disability can pursue their goals free from discrimination, are included in a community that is welcoming and accessible, and know that day in, day out their needs will be met—a time when their independence is recognised, they are free to make their own choices and they can actively participate in the development of policy and legislation that affects them. I'm proud to be part of the Morrison government, which understands that we must continually be better and ensure that we prioritise the needs of those with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to thank our carers, health professionals and service providers for their service, care and support for the disability sector throughout the entire year. Over the last month or so, I've visited many organisations that are making sure that those who live with a disability will become the very best they can be. I visited North West Support School in Burnie recently to have a look at their new all-weather cover for their play equipment, a federally funded project. I want to congratulate them for the great work they're doing at that school; you could feel it as soon as you walked in. The principal, Sarah-Jane Murphy, and the teachers, carers and interdisciplinary team at the campus, as well as at Devonport campus—everyone is doing an amazing job to ensure every student at the school can do their best. And I want to thank those kids that I met that day—beautiful kids. If you guys are in our future then we have a very bright future and a happy one indeed. I also visited Devonport Gymnastics Club's new facilities in Spreyton. Again, this project was funded by the federal government. I met Leanne Lillico, the club's head coach, and her team. Now that they have their new facilities, they can continue to expand the reach of gymnastics. It is envisaged that programs for those living with disabilities will be introduced in partnership with the School of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Special Education
        </a>
        . I think that's an exciting and positive thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all those who have gone above and beyond their call this year, ensuring that our vulnerable receive the quality of care they need to live the best lives they can, I recognise you and say thank you.
