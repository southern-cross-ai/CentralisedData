        Labor's third budget is the wrong budget for Australia. Economist Steven Hamilton called it 'downright reckless'. Economist Paul Bloxham said budget measures 'support underlying inflation, rather than lowering it.' Cherelle Murphy from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EY" rel="nofollow">
         EY
        </a>
        said, 'We were left disappointed.' Why are Australians paying the price for this Prime Minister's wrong priorities and bad decisions?

         I thank the leader of the economic dream team from those opposite, but his partner, the shadow finance minister, had this to say about our budget:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I'm sure Australians that are doing it tough right now will be thrilled to hear that there's something in this Budget for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         She went on to say—just yesterday, a day after the budget:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … everybody needs $300 off their power bill. In fact, we'd like to see more.
        </p>
        <p>
         So they come in here and they say, 'Oh, no; it's all bad.' They voted against power bill relief when it was going in a targeted fashion. They've opposed those who are getting it in a broader sense, just like how on tax policy they opposed, of course, our changes and said they'd reverse the changes that gave every taxpayer a tax cut. Then the Leader of the Opposition said that we should go to an election on it. Well, I await tonight the Leader of the Opposition saying that he'll jack up that first rate from 16c back up to 19c, that he will reduce the amount at which the top rate cuts in from $190,000 down to $180,000—

           The question referred to three economists, who have all said that this budget has failed the Australian people. He is not talking about this budget; he is talking about something else entirely.

            Resume your seat. I don't know what the quotes were. You're right; the question contained quotes, and at the end of the question was 'why are Australians paying the price for this government's wrong priorities?' I'm assuming that the Prime Minister doesn't agree with that premise, and he's arguing why and delivering quotes to support that.
           </p>
           <p>
            You just said the question did contain quotes. I don't know what those quotes were, so, if it's context you're after, the Prime Minister is answering the end part of the actual question, regarding information regarding the budget. It was such a broad question at the end that he's entitled to do that. I think everyone can agree on that. The Prime Minister has the call.

             I was asked about the commentating on our budget. I went to quote from the shadow finance minister, and the shadow Treasurer got up to complain and said that wasn't relevant. What a team they have! They can't decide where the nuclear reactors will be. This bloke was out there on Sunday opposing his own leader on it.

               But I'm asked about reaction. Well, here's what Bran Black of the Business Council of Australia had to say:

               There are some helpful wins for business in this Budget, with

              </p>
              <p>
               He went on to say:

              <p class="italic">
               We called for an Australian response to the
