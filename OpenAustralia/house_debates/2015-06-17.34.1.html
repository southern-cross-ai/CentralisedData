        It is my pleasure to report that I recently was involved in Australia's Biggest Morning Tea with residents at the Aldinga Shores retirement village, as well as the Moana Mews Retirement Village. It was fantastic that residents were all involved in raising money for this very important cause, the Cancer Council. I would particularly like to recognise the members of the social committee for their hard work in organising the fundraising activities.

        At the Aldinga Shores Retirement Village, they put on a fantastic morning tea. I think I was a little heavier when I left! They also treated me to some spectacular line dancing. At the Moana Mews Retirement Village, they also put on a wonderful spread, and there was also the quick-thinking resident dancer Jane Hawkins, who did an impressive impromptu dance when the

        system failed. She is really a great entertainer.

        I have to say that I did not dance at either of these events, but I did enjoy watching them. I was also pleased for my son, Percy. It was one of his first official functions, and he was also warmly welcomed by the residents. In fact, he was much more popular than I was!

        Aldinga Shores raised almost $600. The residents at Moana Mews raised $500. They deserve to be commended for their efforts to raise money for a very important cause, the Cancer Council of
