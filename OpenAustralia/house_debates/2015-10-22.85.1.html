        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on what the government is doing to promote jobs, economic growth and innovation by supporting Australia's creative sector?

         I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I know he will be delighted by an announcement that the Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts and I made earlier today that the government is creating opportunities for more jobs and economic growth and is supporting Australia's creative and innovative industries by securing two blockbuster films to be produced in Australia next year. This government understands that Australia's prosperity and economic growth depends upon seizing new opportunities. We understand that the government must be flexible and responsive to opportunities that promote investment into Australia and that we must be internationally competitive.

         film. These two films are expected to inject over $300 million of offshore investment into Australia, deliver many thousands of jobs for Australians and use the services of more than 6,000 Australian businesses. Film tourism, as my colleague the Minister for Trade and Investment well knows, is an increasing drawcard for overseas visitors, so the spin-off for tourism will be significant too. We do have the evidence for these expectations.
