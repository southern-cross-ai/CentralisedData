        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on the government's investment in water infrastructure? Is the minister aware of any threats to the rollout of these nation-building investments?

         I thank the honourable member for his question and note that Queensland has a very strong interest in water infrastructure. In fact, for the 14 projects that we will fully fund in Queensland, we have not got any response yet from the Queensland Labor government. The Queensland Labor government are more interested in Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk fighting against Ms Trad than actually delivering on water infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am very proud of the fact that the coalition government have delivered about $1.5 billion of water infrastructure modernisation and efficiency improvements and $250 million through round 3 of the Irrigation Infrastructure Operators Program to help people in towns such as Griffith and Deniliquin. Last week I visited the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrumbidgee_Irrigation_Area" rel="nofollow">
          Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area
         </a>
         to announce an additional $25 million for farmers to improve water use efficiency, taking the total commitment to $175 million. This is very important for the member for Farrer. In the seat of Mallee, especially around Mildura, we have put $105 million—if the member wants to look this way—on the table for further modernisation of water infrastructure in that area. We have put $53 million of funding into Queensland irrigation for Healthy HeadWaters. This is very important for people in Maranoa, especially around places such as St George. We have put money towards the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaffey_Dam" rel="nofollow">
          Chaffey Dam
         </a>
         upgrade. Not only did we start it, not only did we provide more funds for it but we also saw it completed, and now it is 97 per cent full.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a $2½ billion water infrastructure program that is moving forward. Once the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         in Queensland decides to work with us, we will have $130 million on the table for the Rookwood weir in the seat of Capricornia, which is also very important to people in a seat of Flynn. We have a further $175 million for Dungowan Dam in the seat of New England and we have further money for the Macalister Irrigation District, and $20 million for the South West Loddon Pipeline in the seat of Murray and further money for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Vale" rel="nofollow">
          McLaren Vale
         </a>
         water storages in the seat of Mayo. We have put $60 million on the table for irrigation projects as part of $120 million package in Tasmania. Of course, once we get this water infrastructure built we will have more jobs come in, and this is why it is very important that we also get the backpackers tax question resolved.

         It was interesting yesterday when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Carlton" rel="nofollow">
          Brian Carlton
         </a>
         , when speaking to the member for Lyons, asked about their plan. Brian Carlton asked, 'Is there an alternate plan?' and the member for Lyons said: 'No. I put forward an alternate, as a local member, and I must stress, this did not go through the Labor Party or the leadership. It is my idea as a local member.' So instead of a backpackers plan, they have an ideas man. They have a regular Dale Kerrigan who is going to come up with ideas. Just watch out; he will have a brush on a hose! He might even dig a hole for Dale Kerrigan.
