        men who have been recently recognised as life members of the Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club. Alan Moffitt and

        </a>
        , two highly respected and dedicated members of my community, have been honoured with the title of life members at the annual general meeting of Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club for 2023. Both Alan and Kevin have contributed significantly to Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club and their wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alan Moffitt joined Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club in 1988 and obtained his bronze medallion that same year. Alan has since gone on to be a patrolling member for 34 years, with 30 of those as a patrolling captain. In 2014, Alan was awarded a Commonwealth National Medal and has been recognised as patrol person of the year on five occasions throughout his service. To this day, Alan continues to be an active patrolling member and coaches and mentors the club's rookies. Alan is an integral member of the Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club, never shying away from important duties and supporting the club wherever possible. He helps fundraise for the club community, participating in doorknocking, bucket brigades, raffles, functions and so much more. Not only is Alan involved with the Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club, but you can also expect to find him supporting other outstanding local organisations, including the Red Shield Appeal, Surf Life Saving

        , as well as volunteering at Killcare Beach and the Entrance, plus more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kevin Manning has been named a member of the Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club since 1980 and has never been associated with any other surf lifesaving club throughout his service. Kevin successfully completed his bronze medallion training in 1981 and has been a patrolling member for 18 years. Similarly to Alan, Kevin never takes a break and supports his club whenever they need assistance. For example, Kevin is a committed and reliable member with the club's fundraising activities, and he involves himself in the club's carnival events and so much more. He supports the club's memorial wall, is associated with Words on the Waves Writers Festival, Umina Blue Swimmers and the Umina rugby league football club and helps facilitate the luncheons for the

        To both Alan Moffitt and Kevin Manning, two outstanding members of the Central Coast community, a huge congratulations on your recognition. Thank you for everything that you do, not just for the Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club but for the wider Central Coast community and the peninsula. You are remarkable, you are passionate and you are definitely both outstanding men. Our community is so grateful for your service.
