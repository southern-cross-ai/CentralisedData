        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House the benefits to the economy that will flow now that the world's biggest carbon tax has been abolished?

           has been lifted from their shoulders. They have had to wait nine long months since giving a government the mandate to get rid of this carbon tax for it to actually happen, because Labor has resisted it to the end. Labor has resisted it even though they promised in Townsville before the election that they would get rid of the carbon tax. Labor is a friend of the carbon tax and will stay that way well and truly into the future. They have declared that. If they promise at the next election that they are going to get rid of it, that promise will be just as empty as the promises in 2010 and 2013.

           But at last it has happened: Australian householders will have the burden of a $550-a-year cost lifted from their bills. The $9 billion hit on Australian jobs will be gone. These are the sorts of things that make a real difference to our economy. Our power bills go down, our business becomes more competitive, and we are able to supply products more efficiently and more competitively to the rest of the world. This is going to deliver real benefits to the Australian economy and to Australian consumers. And I congratulate the mayor of Brisbane, Australia's biggest local authority, which has been amongst the first off the block to make the commitment that they will reduce rates—

               will include a $36 refund. The people of Brisbane will receive a $36 refund because the carbon tax is gone. Their costs will be lower. The cost of disposing of garbage will be lower and they are passing on that benefit to the Brisbane ratepayers.

               Other local authorities, I hope, will take the lead. Other businesses also are obligated to take the lead, and this government, as promised in the election, has committed extra resources to the
