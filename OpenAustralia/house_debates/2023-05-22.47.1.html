        In March of this year the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_End" rel="nofollow">
         Hill End
        </a>
        area of my electorate was devastated by bushfire. Eighteen thousand hectares of land was burnt, several homes were lost, and livestock and native species tragically perished. Farmers have lost feed, stock and a huge amount of fencing. It's going to take years to get them back on their feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outlook for the winter is dry, and this makes their situation particularly concerning. The community, while it has been amazing in donating hay, through the likes of Pyramul farmer Penny Hundy and Geurie Lions Club member

        coordinating the efforts, there is still a whole lot of work that needs to be done. While this event has been declared a natural disaster and some assistance has been made available, the joint

        and federal government $75,000 special disaster grants still have not been activated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently asked the Prime Minister about this in question time. He said he hadn't received a request from the last New South Wales government to get the ball rolling. While the previous New South Wales government could have activated this support, it failed to do so. All the while, the hurt and the heartbreak in the district continues. I have contacted the new

        </a>
        and requested that these crucial grants be activated. Seventy-five thousand dollars can really help with new fencing, feed and other provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the weather only getting colder, my message to the New South Wales and Australian governments is: get the support for Hill End moving.
