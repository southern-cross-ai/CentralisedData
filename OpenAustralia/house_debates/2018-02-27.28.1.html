        I take this opportunity to commend the Malaysia Singapore Association for their wonderful annual

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Doncaster" rel="nofollow">
         East Doncaster
        </a>
        just last weekend. The Malaysia Singapore Association, as the name suggests, is an organisation of people who have emigrated from Malaysia and Singapore in particular, from Chinese, Indian and other Asian backgrounds. It's a very a vibrant organisation, which has a number of functions and brings people from those communities together on a number of occasions each year. The event at the Happy &amp; Lucky Restaurant in East Doncaster was a very joyous occasion. Happy and lucky, of course, is a great description for the year of the dog. Everybody there was certainly very happy. Let's hope that in the year of the dog they will be very lucky as well. It was a great occasion, which Margie and I very much enjoyed, along with all other occasions of the Malaysian Singaporean Association. This is one of many groups in my electorate, which is one of the most multicultural, ethnically diverse electorates in Australia. It has many people from all parts of Asia and all over the world, including the old countries of Europe such as Italy and Greece, not to also mention the

        and others who have made Menzies their home over the past few decades. To all of those who were there and all others, I wish them a very happy
