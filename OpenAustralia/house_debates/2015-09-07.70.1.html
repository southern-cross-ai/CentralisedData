        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Mr Truss. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on the benefits to northern Australia of the landmark China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and what threats there are to these benefits?

         I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question. One of the highest priorities for this government is the creation of jobs. In fact, we have had some success. Since September 2013, this government has created 335,000 more jobs in the economy.

           That is four times the rate that we inherited from the previous government—four times the rate. But we need to do better and the China free trade agreement is good news for us all. The opportunities for further job creation, in both city and country, are enormous. The opportunities for northern Australia are particularly significant. The
           <i>
            Our north, our future
           </i>
           white paper on northern Australia helps equip the north to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that the China free trade agreement will open up.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Australia
           </a>
           has an enormous amount to offer to Chinese investors. The talents and skills of northern Australia can add significantly to our trade relationship with China. The majority of our exports to China, in fact, come from northern Australia, so there is already a strong linkage—a strong connection—and there are huge opportunities for us to expand on that. For instance, in the resources sector across Australia, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerals_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Minerals Council of Australia
           </a>
           has outlined some of the benefits to Australian industry as a result of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Reducing tariffs on minerals, including the elimination of all coal tariffs, is likely to save the Australian industry around $600 million. That is $600 million just from the elimination of those tariffs alone. That, clearly, is going to have an enormous boost for northern Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           But there is plenty more. Beef tariffs of up to 25 per cent will be gone. Wine tariffs of 30 per cent, horticulture tariffs of 30 per cent, seafood tariffs of 15 per cent, dairy tariffs of 20 per cent—all will be eliminated under this arrangement. Of course, one of the most spectacular of northern Australian industries is the pearling industry. Paspaley Pearls can look forward to a 21 per cent reduction in their tariffs over the first four years of this agreement. So there are very substantial benefits.
