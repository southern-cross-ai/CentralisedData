       <p>
        I would like to draw to the attention of the House the fact that, since 1997, the United Kempo Martial Arts Academy has been providing instruction in martial arts for the youth of the south-west of Sydney. Based in Austral, under the guidance and direction of Sensei Jordan Micakovski—a man so committed to his local community that he was awarded the local Australian of the year by Liverpool council—the academy has achieved a reputation for excellence at a regional, national and, now, international level.
       </p>
       <p>
        In August of this year, the academy entered a team in the inaugural World Martial Arts Games, which were held in Victoria, Canada. The United Kempo team won a total of 48 medals—21 gold, 15 silver and 12 bronze. Two grand champion awards were won, as was the champion of champions trophy. Australia won second place overall in the tournament, narrowly losing to the host nation, Canada, which was a remarkable achievement, given the fact that there were a total of 27 nations in competition at those games.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to congratulate team members on their personal achievements: Lochlan Tabone, three gold, one silver, one bronze; Samuele Xotta, one gold, three silver, one bronze; Sash Dimevski, one gold, one silver, two bronze; Daria Xotta, two gold, one silver, one bronze; Simon Everitt, one gold, two bronze and qualified grand champion for the 10- to 13-year-olds; Lucy Di Lario, two gold, one silver, one bronze; Adam Di Lario, three gold, two silver; Darren Tabone, two gold, one bronze and qualified for under belt grand champion aged 18 years and older;

        , one silver, one bronze; Bob Everitt, one silver, one bronze; Jake Cremona, two gold, one silver, one bronze; and Sensei Alex Micakovski, three gold, two silver and grand champion black belt for 18- to 25-year-olds and overall adult grand champion in black belt weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very proud to be the patron of United Kempo Martial Arts Academy. I am proud of not simply the team’s achievements but what this organisation does within our community and particularly what it does for the youth of the community of south-western Sydney. It is very much a credit to Sensei Jordan, his leadership and his giving of his time so freely to the youth of our area.
