        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Personnel. What is the Albanese Labor government doing to support the wellbeing of defence personnel, veterans and their families?

         Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment to your esteemed role, which is important to our Australian democracy. I thank the member for Holt for her question on this very important issue. I congratulate her on her election to this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese Labor government is committed to improving and adapting to the needs of currently serving defence personnel, veterans and their families. The Australian community has a clear expectation that veterans and their families will be well looked after. We are committed to delivering a package of practical supports—measures that will improve the welfare and wellbeing of veterans and their families. That's why I was so pleased to introduce legislation just today that will achieve that. It will go to supporting families who are bereaved and those who are in crisis, no matter the nature of that crisis. This legislation demonstrates that the new Albanese Labor government is committed to addressing and providing greater support to defence personnel, veterans and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the services front, we will develop 10 new veterans and families hubs that will bring services together in communities where veterans actually live, making them accessible and tailored to the needs of veterans in those communities. In this week, Homelessness Week, I'm very happy to say that the Albanese Labor government has committed $30 million towards addressing veteran homelessness, making sure that we're addressing the unique needs of our veterans facing homelessness or at risk of homelessness and we're providing the services that they need to address that.
        </p>
        <p>
         We of course are committed to making sure that veterans can get a job, because we know that is a clear pathway to success back into the civilian life for veterans and their families. Our Veterans' Employment Program is about not just connecting veterans to jobs but making sure that employers know the great benefits that a veteran can provide to them and to their business.
        </p>
        <p>
         Right now we have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Defence and Veteran Suicide. Defence and veteran suicide is a national tragedy. We listened to the families of veterans and defence personnel who have taken their lives, in supporting the call for this royal commission to be established. I look forward to receiving the interim report from that royal commission when it is handed down next week. I also look forward to meeting with my state and territory veteran minister counterparts in the coming weeks so that we can work together to make sure that across the country we are delivering a better future for our veterans.
