        For students, parents and teachers, 2020 presented new challenges: online learning, being separated from classmates or the uncertainty of disruptions at home. Despite the difficult year in 2020, students in the Berowra electorate achieved some outstanding results. I want to acknowledge in particular two students in my electorate who came first in the state in their respective subjects. Congratulations to Lachlan Voss from

        Each year I have the privilege of presenting awards to students in the electorate for their academic achievements, citizenship, leadership and outstanding efforts. In 2020 I presented awards to students of all ages to recognise their success throughout the year. Congratulations to these recipients of citizenship and service awards, which recognise ongoing dedication to serving peers in the broader school community: Evie Herczeg from
