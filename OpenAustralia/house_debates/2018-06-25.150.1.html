        Bennelong is often called the innovation capital of Australiaâ€”that's because it is! A large part of what makes us great is our booming health industry. But, as with all things, nothing is great without incredible people behind the scenes. I'm very pleased to see that some of these people have been recognised in this year's Queen's birthday honours.
