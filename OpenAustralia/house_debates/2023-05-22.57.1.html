        Community and sporting groups in the Redlands are facing significant funding cuts due to actions taken by the Labor government. The Labor government has reduced funding for the Redlands from the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which has been instrumental in supporting numerous projects in the area. This year's allocation for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        will be $716,000 less than what was provided in the last coalition budget. Furthermore, this critical funding will not be renewed beyond this allocation, passing the cost of these important projects to ratepayers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Stronger Communities Program has had a significant impact in supporting grassroots organisations, community and sporting groups. Amongst many grant applications this year, we were able to seed $20,000 through this funding stream for the

        rugby league club to purchase new shade sails and $4,500 dollars for Multicap's Capalaba community hub to acquire new outdoor furniture and a barbecue. Regrettably, the Labor government has decided to eliminate this competitive local investment model.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor government has also scrapped the coalition's Building Better Regions Fund program and replaced it with the Growing Regions fund. This change has resulted in the

        islands in my electorate being excluded from this funding stream, due to changes in eligibility conditions. This is particularly heartbreaking given community led efforts in 2017 to get this funding made applicable to the islands. This week I've written to the minister seeking to have this decision reversed. I strongly encourage the government to restore this important funding for my community.
