        Fans of the cooking show
        <i>
         MasterChef

        may have heard of Ben Bullock, a Perth based lawyer who made the top 24 this year. What viewers may not know is that Ben, at just 28 years of age, has established a successful career as a solicitor at Philipoff Legal and is also the head chef of the Paddock and Farm restaurant in Bedford. With such an impressive

        </a>
        , it may be hard to believe Ben has struggled with depression for a number of years. It is clear the black dog does not discriminate when choosing its victims and that career success provides no immunity. Ben says that despite having access to employee assistance programs and strong family support he felt too embarrassed to access services or to tell anyone he had been battling depression, choosing instead to medicate with drugs and alcohol.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now Ben is using his experience with mental health issues to drive awareness of suicide prevention by doing something incredible. Ben is riding 30,000 kilometres across 30 countries from Perth in Australia to Perth in Scotland to raise money for beyondblue. This trip will take Ben and his Hunter motorbike approximately six to nine months to complete, a huge physical and emotional feat. Ben hopes this trip will serve as a conversation starter, giving other young men like him the opportunity to chat about how they are feeling with the people close to them and to get the support that they need. I'm happy to continue that conversation in this place, and I encourage others to continue it in their workplaces and in their homes too.
