        I rise today to ask one simple question: when does good government start? We asked this question 2½ years ago. We asked it a year ago. And we are still asking that question. Australians are getting tired of waiting for the people opposite to find some unity. All they are getting is more and more division. What they have seen—today again—is a government at war with itself, the same as the government they changed. This one is still at war with itself. Still we are nowhere on marriage equality. We are still looking at family payment cuts of up to $5,000 a year. We are still looking at $100,000 degrees. We have still got the same lack of action on climate change happening over there, with that great 'Indirect' Action policy! We have got attacks on Medicare, including a task force to privatise Medicare. We have got the second-rate copper

        . We have got cuts to schools and hospitals. To top it off, today we have got a Treasurer who does not know Australia's

        from New Zealand's GDP, and we have got the member for Deakin, in my city's paper, demonstrating that he does not trust teachers or principals. This is from a man who has had not one word to say about the $30 billion cuts to schools.
