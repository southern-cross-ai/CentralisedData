       <p>
        It was almost a year ago that my community experienced those devastating floods, particularly in Llandilo, Castlereagh, Londonderry and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Banks" rel="nofollow">
         Agnes Banks
        </a>
        . There were families there who lost everything in their homes. I took the Prime Minister there to see the devastation in person. This is why I really welcome the investment from the Morrison government, along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        government, of $33 million in funding to identify more than 100 infrastructure improvements to boost the resilience of the flood evacuation network in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley. This project will provide a plan of works to improve flood evacuation such as road widening, bridge structures, road raising, pinch point upgrades and drainage improvements.
       </p>

        I look forward to these upgrades and initiatives being rolled out as quickly as possible. As I said, there were a number of families quite devastated by those one-in-50-year floods. It's something that we don't want to happen again. This is one measure to address those serious issues as they impact our community. We are a community who love our

        , with homes built quite close. Seeing that in person, up close, was hard to handle for a lot of people in our community. So I look forward to these upgrades, worth $33 million, getting started as quickly as possible.
