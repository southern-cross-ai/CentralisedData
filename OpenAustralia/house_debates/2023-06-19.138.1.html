        I rise today to give a well-deserved shout-out to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Leonora" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Leonora

        chief executive officer Jim Epis, who is retiring after 45 years of distinguished service to the Northern Goldfields region of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        . Jim's career with the Shire of Leonora started way back in 1978, driving a grader on the shire's outside works crew. Within two years, he had been raised to the position of junior clerk, and after 14 years of building his knowledge of the machinations of local government, he was appointed deputy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        in 1995. Twelve months later, he became the CEO.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim has given a lifetime of dedicated service to his shire, so it was my absolute honour to give a speech at his recent retirement bash. I joined a long line of friends, family, colleagues and politicians, past and present, singing the praises of '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jim" rel="nofollow">
         Gentleman Jim
        </a>
        'â€”a huge character but also a humble, quiet achiever, whose Leonora legacy will endure for generations to come. In 1996, when Jim became CEO, a community survey was conducted to identify priority projects that would enhance the livability and functionality of the shire. Of the 48 projects originally nominated, 35 have been completed under Jim's watch, with six others underway, including an aged-care facility, sewerage infill program, heavy vehicle bypass and increased housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the benefit of those who may never visit Leonora, picture a lovingly restored and maintained historic Goldfields town that also supports the extraction of billions of dollars of resources mined in the surrounding shire. Leonora's main street features historic buildings and facades, shaded parking and recreational areas, public ablutions, and a community nature playground.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Tower Street
        </a>
        also serves as the running track for one of Australia's richest foot races, the annual Leonora gift, and it's the finish line for the annual Goldfields Cyclassic bike race hosted by the shires of Leonora and Menzies. On the outskirts of town lie the historic Gwalia Ghost Town, Museum and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_House" rel="nofollow">
         Hoover House
        </a>
        , towered over by the Gwalia mine headframe, the oldest timber headframe in Australia. This headframe underwent a massive $1 million upgrade funded by the previous government under Jim's careful watch.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's been my absolute pleasure to work with Jim for almost 10 years and see him deliver so many federally funded projects and programs. For me, the most significant will always be the introduction of the cashless debit card trial, which was initiated by a teen suicide crisis in Leonora. Jim's passion for his community drove the ensuing consultations, card implementation, reviews and endless critiques by those who will never set foot in Leonora or experience the social dysfunction that he has witnessed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim, you're an absolute champion of your Leonora community and you are more deserving of the
