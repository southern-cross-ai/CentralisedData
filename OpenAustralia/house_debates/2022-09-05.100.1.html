        on indulgence—I'd like to pay tribute to the life of Sir David Smith. Every student of Australian history recognises Sir David. Those iconic images of the Dismissal are part of our national story. Today we recognise the contribution behind the scenes of, to quote the

        , one of the most respected public servants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir David Smith was born on 9 August 1933 in Melbourne. He was educated at Princes Hill State School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_College" rel="nofollow">

        and the

        . He joined the Commonwealth Public Service in 1953. He was principal private secretary to the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Works from 1958 to 1963. He was then appointed secretary to the

        from 1971 to 1973. From 1973 through to 1990 he was the official secretary to the Governor-General. It was during this service that he gained public attention, to put it mildly, when, on

       </p>
       <p>
        Sir David was also the inaugural secretary of the Order of Australia from 1975 to 1990, and he helped design Australia's own honours and awards system. He received numerous honours himself, being invested by the Queen as a Commander of the Royal Victorian order in 1977, appointed an

         on indulgence—I join with the minister in his words in honouring the life of Sir David Smith. He was born in 1933 and began his career as a public servant in 1953. He became private secretary to the minister for interior and works in 1958, and he was made the official secretary to then Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck in 1973. He served with great distinction five Governors-General, including

          Sir John Kerr

          Bill Hayden
         </a>
         . He was, as the minister pointed out, the official secretary to former Governor-General Sir John Kerr on 11 November 1975, that famous day in Australian political history. He was the man on the steps, the man who read out the proclamation sacking Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sir David played a role in the establishment of the Order of Australia and the transition from imperial honours to an Australian honours system. He retired in 1991, and, to his great credit, was a strong supporter for constitutional monarchy. After political life he worked as a volunteer, including, as the minister pointed out, giving guided tours to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Old Parliament House
         </a>
         . He was knighted by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth" rel="nofollow">
          Queen Elizabeth
         </a>
         in 1990. He served the office and the Commonwealth with great distinction. He is survived by his wife, June, and three sons. May he rest in peace.
