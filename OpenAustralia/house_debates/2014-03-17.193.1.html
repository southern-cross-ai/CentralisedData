        Just recently I was in the wonderful position of being able to say goodbye to Dr Michael Davey. Dr Michael Davey has had an incredible journey in his life. He was a foster child and was abused in his childhood. He ended up writing a book called
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_of_Hope" rel="nofollow">
          Journey of Hope
         </a>
        </i>
        , which has now sold over 1,000 editions, so he has done extremely well with his book. Very many people in the community of Gilmore are so proud of him and what he has done. He became a maths teacher and was a very successful maths teacher, but just recently he decided to ride across Australia, raising money for children with cancer. So, on a sunny Sunday morning, he set off from Nowra, outside the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre, with his merry band of 10 riders and his wife. They intend to ride right across Australia raising money for this very worthy cause, and I am very proud to have sponsored him for $500 towards this magnificent program. I wish him all the very best as he journeys across our nation, making the awareness of children with cancer much more significant. We all know that the impact of cancer on the lives of children is huge. We see children's wards where children are suffering, and, while they can stay happy in most of their life, it is important that we each recognise the contribution that we make to their health and happiness and make sure we raise enough funds for equipment, family care and family holidays in this situation.
