        ns, was deeply saddened to hear last week of the death of former Labor senator for Western Australia Patricia Giles at the age of 88, but I'm also incredibly honoured to mark the occasion of her death with an acknowledgement and celebration of her life today.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Giles" rel="nofollow">
         Pat Giles
        </a>
        is best known for her career-defining advocacy for women. She founded the Perth branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Electoral_Lobby" rel="nofollow">

        in 1973 and was later the first woman on the executive of the Trades &amp; Labor Council of Western Australia. When she was elected to the Senate in 1981, there were barely a dozen other women in our federal parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pat Giles, due to her amazing work, was instrumental in Labor's gender equality agenda in the 1980s and early 1990s. She led a number of international delegations and chaired the

        has also created the Pat Giles Award in her honour, which is awarded annually to a woman advancing the lives of other women.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of all of the party, like others here, I extend my heartfelt condolences to all of her familyâ€”her children, Anne, Penelope, Fiona, Josephine and Timothy, now passed away; and also her grandchildren, Jessica, Michael, Brodie, Hugo and Rachel, now passed away. Pat Giles, your legacy will never be forgotten.
