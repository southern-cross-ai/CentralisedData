         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am advised by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITSA" rel="nofollow">
          ITSA
         </a>
         ) that a debtor's petition signed by the bankrupt (Bankruptcy Number 5091/1998) and dated 7 October 1998 was presented under subsection 55(1) of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Bankruptcy Act
         </a>
         1966 ('the Act') to ITSA on 9 October 1998 and accepted by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Receiver" rel="nofollow">
          Official Receiver
         </a>
         's delegate at 9.48am on that date. The petition was endorsed accordingly as required by subsection 55(4A) of the Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The petition was not rejected under subsection 55(3) of the Act, which sets out when the Official Receiver may reject a petition, as it complied with the approved form, was accompanied by a Statement of Affairs which the Official Receiver's delegate did not consider to be inadequate. I am advised there were no grounds on which it could be legally rejected by the Official Receiver.
