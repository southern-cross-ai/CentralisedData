       <p>
        Firstly, I want to wish the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Chinese
        </a>
        Community a very Happy New Year for 2016, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Monkey" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Monkey
        </a>
        . May the Year of the Monkey bring with it health, happiness and prosperity for all. In my electorate of Barton the Australian Chinese community is a prominent population who contribute to our way of life, enriching our cultural values in every aspect.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate is home to many first and second generation Chinese migrants, who have maintained their cultural roots here in Australia yet have also embraced the Australian way of life in every possible way. It has been my great honour to witness, firsthand, the pride and joy the Australian Chinese community takes in adding to our community of Barton but also in celebrating such important momentous occasions like this.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we farewell the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Sheep" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Sheep
        </a>
        , it is important to reflect on the year that has been. 2015 was a year with many great achievements and successes, among which was the signing of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This agreement has significantly accelerated the economic exchange and cooperation between China and Australia, helping both of our nations to build stronger economies, bringing a more competitive rate for consumers, which will benefit both households and businesses as well as create more opportunities for growth and jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement sets a historic precedent for the next phase of Australia's economic relationship with China. The agreement provides significant opportunities for Australia in China, which is Australia's largest export market for both goods and services, accounting for nearly a third of total exports, and a growing source of foreign investment. The agreement will also continue to significantly improve market access for a range of service sector suppliers with new prospects for Australian banks, insurers, law firms, professional service suppliers and education service exporters. And there are many outstanding service providers within my electorate of Barton that can capitalise on these new opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the bond between China and Australia is not just built on an economic level. Cultural interchanges hold equal importance. Citizens from both Australia and China are beginning to gain a greater understanding of each other's culture and history, their way of living and their life values. In March 2015 I held the Barton-Shunde Festival, which helped showcase some of the wonderful cultures and traditions of the people of Shunde in China. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Australian Chinese community, in my electorate of Barton, in building cultural, economic and personal ties in the Year of the Monkey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome into my electorate of Barton the new residents and small businesses located in Hurstville as well as the surrounding areas, such as Clempton Park and Marrickville. With the joining of these areas into the seat of Barton, my electorate will now house one of the largest Chinese communities in Australia. Hurstville's growth in the city centre alone is set to soar by over 100 per cent by 2036, an enormous growth in population. These forward estimates make Hurstville the fastest growing suburb in my electorate, as its expansion in infrastructure and population has never been greater.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted for Hurstville and these surrounding areas to join the Barton electorate, as there has never been a more exciting time for an MP to help a community evolve and I look forward to making real progress for the people of Barton. I am also pleased that Hurstville will bring its strong multicultural presence to Barton. It is a great addition to a seat that already has such a large component and is something I am proud to represent and defend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiculturalism to me is not just a slogan or a passing fashion. I see it as a whole component of life in Australia, which has been pivotal in the pursuit of a variety of goals over the years, including the principles of social justice, the recognition of identities and appreciation of diversity. Multicultural diversity on a democratic platform guarantees our shared values into the future. With multiculturalism comes many cultural festivities and events. I had the pleasure of experiencing such an event in the suburb of Hurstville recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hurstville City Council kicked off its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Lunar New Year
        </a>
        celebrations with a spectacular street festival along Forest Road. The festival, this year, attracted more than 40,000 people to this wonderful community event, an event that celebrated the rich Chinese culture to its fullest extent. The day was a resounding success, with people of all ages coming together to enjoy the live entertainment, vibrant street parade, free kids' activities and food and market stalls.
       </p>
       <p>
        My New Year's pledge to my electorate is to deliver for the people of Barton through genuine engagement and advocacy for our local community. From my family to yours, Happy
