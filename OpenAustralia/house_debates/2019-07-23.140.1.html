        I rise to speak about women's sport as well. I didn't actually catch the game, but well done to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Ferns" rel="nofollow">

        on their win and well done to the Diamonds for making the final. I'm a netball player myself; I love the sport.

        Ash Barty—how good's Ash Barty? I loved watching her win the

        . I hope she goes on to win more titles. There are many women excelling in sport my electorate as well. From the netball courts to the world stage, Petrie has a lot of local sporting stars to be proud of.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Power_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Peninsula Power Football Club
        </a>
        has a track record as one of the strongest clubs in South-East Queensland, and that includes producing some of our nation's best female footballers and Matildas. Former 'Power girl' Teagan Micah, who I met the other night at the opening of their new indoor training centre at the Peninsula Power Football Club on 13 July, currently plays goalkeeper for the Matildas and follows in the footsteps of a number of locals and Power girls who have worn the green and gold, including Larissa Crummer and Redcliffe's Kate McShea.

        Power's premier women's side has also made a name for itself as the team to beat. The women are currently gearing up for a semifinal clash in August and are eyeing off their second consecutive Elaine Watson Cup title. It helps when you've got

        , and has recently returned home and    quickly earned herself the title of the highest goalscorer in the league.

        The North Lakes Blues is a great local netball club in my electorate. Its netballers are renowned on the courts. This year, 10 players aged 12 to open were selected and competed in the Pine Rivers State Age Championships and the country comp up in Bundaberg. Club president Samantha Malopito said it's great to encourage the littlies and, more and more, they are seeing women continuing to play well into their 50s. This year they had three senior teams, ranging in age from 18 through to masters, pulling on the bibs. Next year they're increasing that number to four because of the increased demand. I'm really pleased that the federal government has allocated some funding for new courts, and we need the

        to get on board with that as quickly as possible as well.

        Women's sport is essential. I want to quickly talk about a few sporting champion grants that have been delivered.
