       <p>
        I'm so proud to represent the Willetton Basketball Association and their 3Â½ thousand players, 300 teams and more than 1,000 volunteers. It was a pretty special day in November when we confirmed and announced, with the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, $5.5 million in federal government funding for the expansion of the Willetton basketball stadium. We were joined by players, family and supporters to celebrate the big news and the announcement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also an important opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the association's president, Mr Phil Nixon.

        and his army of volunteers devote so much time to managing teams, coaching, umpiring, doing rosters and compliance and running one of WA's biggest community organisations. That $5.5 million is half of the cost of doubling the current stadium, with an additional four courts with associated male and female change rooms, meeting rooms and spaces for supporting health services for players and the wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the Prime Minister and all the ministers that assisted us with this funding, and their very able staff, for their help and guidance. The ball now falls in the court of the WA state Labor government to deliver the final $2 million to ensure that this project can be realised. We all share the very important goal of getting more kids into playing team sport. This federal funding will help get 150 kids currently on the waiting list, and hundreds more, out on the court, keeping fit, making friends and learning the important life skills they do in team sport.
