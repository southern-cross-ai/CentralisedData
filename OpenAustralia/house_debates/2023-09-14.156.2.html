       <p>
        John Davis, owner and managing director of Pepper Tree Wines, Briar Ridge Vineyard, Tallavera Grove and Carillion Wines, has forged a reputation as an astute viticulturist with a skill in matching soil types with the most suited grape varieties. As the first to plant emerging varieties in the Hunter Valley, John has championed innovation in his vineyards and, more broadly, through his investment into soil mapping across the Hunter region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout his more than 50 years in viticulture, Graham Doran has worked with some of the Hunter Valley's most iconic vineyards. His work for Mount Dangar Vineyard and

        Dr Harry Tulloch has been a true pioneer through his immense innovative viticultural research which led to the selection of premium quality semillon and shiraz clones. Shiraz clone 1654 is still in circulation today and has become one of the most widely planted in Australia. Throughout his career, Harry has championed new styles of wines and was the first in the Hunter to incorporate verdelho into blends of semillon.
