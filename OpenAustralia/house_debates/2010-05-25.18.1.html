            <p>
             On the question of the debate about the resources super profits tax, there will be a range of views expressed out there in the community, in the commentariat, on the part of industry and on the part of mining companies. We have all sides of the argument participating in it. However, what we have on the part of those opposite is an entire policy briefing run out of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCA" rel="nofollow">
              MCA
             </a>
             . For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to stand up yesterday and say that the mining industry should pay no more tax is an extraordinary statement. She is in effect saying exactly what the MCA want her to say. That is what is occurring here.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it is high time the Leader of the Opposition clarified what their policy is on this matter. Is the mining industry paying enough tax? Is it not paying enough tax? Until we have clarity about their alternative position, this debate is fundamentally hampered. Our plan is clear: funding better super for working families, funding tax cuts for Australian businesses, funding smaller tax for small business and funding the future infrastructure needs of the nation. That is where we stand. We do not know where you stand at all.

                 <p>
                  I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question, because it does provide an opportunity to correct several statements from members opposite. The government’s superannuation reforms are crucial to boosting the retirement incomes of Australians, and these reforms are funded by the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Super_Profits_Tax" rel="nofollow">
                   Resource Super Profits Tax
                  </a>
                  . There are 8.4 million Australians relying on these reforms to boost their retirement incomes. A 30-year-old on average weekly earnings would have their retirement income boosted by $108,000 on their retirement.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There has been some commentary by members opposite about the effects of the Resource Super Profits Tax on people’s retirement incomes. The shadow minister against superannuation has made some comments. His commentary did not go to why the opposition is standing in the way of the boost to retirement incomes of Australians. The comments did not go to why the opposition is standing in the way of giving low-income earners their superannuation tax back. They went to a scare campaign. The shadow minister against superannuation—the member for Cowper—said this to the

                 <p class="italic">
                  We also must remember the collapse in mining share investment is having a domino effect right through the economy that will drive down super returns even further.

                  He is not the only one. The member for Goldstein said it, the member for

                  said it and the Leader of the Opposition said it. Now it is time for some facts which will show that the opposition’s scare campaign is simply sophistry. It is true that the value of Australian mining stocks has fallen since 2 May. It is also true that the value of stocks generally in Australia has fallen. It is also true that mining stocks around the world have fallen in value. The Australian materials index covering mining stocks has fallen by eight per cent since 30 April, the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
                   ASX
                  </a>
                  200 has fallen by 8.6 per cent and the financials index has fallen by 10.57 per cent. The Resource Super Profits tax has had a big impact on the financial services index.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is also interesting to look around the world. As I said, the ASX 200 has fallen by 8.6 per cent, the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE" rel="nofollow">
                   FTSE

                  has fallen by 8.7 per cent,

                  ’s has fallen by 9.5 per cent and the Nikkei has fallen by 11.7 per cent. So the superprofits tax has really hit Japan hard. I have heard a lot of outlandish claims from the opposition over the past fortnight. I do not think I have heard the opposition claim yet that the Resource Super Profits Tax has caused the Greek debt crisis. I might have missed it. It would be about as outlandish as most of their claims. That crisis, which has caused stock market falls around the world, has not been caused by the

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The opposition say that the Resource Super Profits Tax is affecting superannuation returns. Let us see what the superannuation industry has to say to their claims.

                  , had to say. John Brogden says of the argument that the mining tax is having an impact on superannuation returns:

                 <p class="italic">
                  It doesn’t hold up in the short term, and it won’t hold up in the long term. I am very strongly of the view that it is quite erroneous to link a negative outcome on mining to a negative outcome on superannuation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That is what John Brogden said of the arguments that are being put by those opposite. I wonder if he is a Labor hack as well. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition appears to have gone quiet.

                     I referred to the various indexes, but this analysis is also borne out if you look at individual share prices. Let us take, for example, for the sake of argument,
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
                      BHP
                     </a>
                     . Since 30 April, BHP has fallen by 7.24 per cent. In other words, BHP has outperformed the market in the past three weeks. Perhaps that is why so many analysts are recommending a buy on BHP—advice that at least one opposition frontbencher has taken to heart.

                        tried to desert my seat I would probably try to make investments to improve my retirement income as well. But we actually care more about the retirement incomes of all Australians. If the opposition want to be taken seriously, they should stop crying crocodile tears about the price of mining shares and should support our efforts to improve the retirement incomes of all Australians, to give all Australians a secure and dignified retirement.

                         My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to 778,000 self-funded retirees who depend on the returns from their superannuation. Did the government do any analysis on how the new tax on mining would affect investments of self-funded retirees and its impact on their standard of living and, if so, will the Prime Minister release that analysis?

                          on the superannuation earnings of Australians. The first thing I would say in response to the honourable member’s question is that the way in which you boost the superannuation earnings of Australians is to increase the

                          from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is the first thing you do because superannuation adequacy for working families is, frankly, not sufficient.

My recollection of the question from the member for Pearce is that it went to the impact of the government’s proposed tax on superannuation and, furthermore, it went to a range of other matters as well, including those analyses taken into account by the Treasury.

                                Thank you, Mr Speaker. On page 553 the second paragraph says that a basic requirement for an answer to be relevant is that the answer maintains a link to the substance of the question. The substance of the question was the plight of self-funded retirees who have already retired, making no further contribution, and therefore to be relevant it must address that point.

                                   I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker, on relevance. My question was quite specific about whether the government had conducted an analysis to determine the impact of its new tax on mining on self-funded retirees, and whether the Prime Minister would release such an analysis. I know that there are many people in the electorate of Pearce who have been affected directly—

The question has now been repeated on several occasions. The Prime Minister is only a fraction of time into the answer. The Prime Minister has the call.

                                     Furthermore, in the Treasury’s analysis of the impact on the economy, that is what underpins what is returned to the superannuation industry through investments over time for both the mining industry and the general economy. If you look at the Econtech modelling contained in the Treasury report, it projects ahead a 0.7 per cent increase in economic growth over time.

                                        Secondly—and I say this for the honourable member—it also projects ahead a 5.5 per cent increase in overall mining activity. It follows as a consequence that the overall impact of these reforms on the broad economy will lead to greater growth in general, and for the mining sector in particular and therefore for superannuation funds invested in those sectors into the future.

                                        Furthermore, I draw the honourable member’s attention to the response just given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The minister for finance in particular emphasised the recent performance of resource stocks as against non-resource stocks within this country and abroad. The member for Pearce, as she said, reflecting on the concerns of her constituents should have listened carefully to what the minister for finance said. He said that the changes over the last month in resource stocks have been less, by and large, than those in the financial services sector.
