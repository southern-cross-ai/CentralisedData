        I rise to congratulate all of those competitors in the Primary Schools Cup for netball held in Bundaberg over the weekend. There were 800-plus competitors in Bundaberg—with their support teams and families in tow—and I'm told it was a great event, incredibly successful. There were cars everywhere! It filled not only the car park but also all the available space around the field as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event was made possible because of a $500,000 grant from the federal government in 2016 for the extension to the courts, which created the capacity to deliver these types of carnivals locally, along with a $17,600 grant to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundaberg_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Bundaberg Regional Council
        </a>
        , through the Building Better Regions Fund, a community investments stream, which has supported them to deliver such a large carnival. I'm advised they'll be back again, and I think that is fantastic.
       </p>
       <p>
        On an absolutely tragic note, on Friday there was a fatal crash on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        . There were people travelling to this carnival who were, very unfortunately, involved in a terrible collision. Some individuals lost their lives, including the competitor from the Coomera Netball Club. In respect to her family, I will call her only as Olivia. She was eight, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        , and known as the 'queen of hugs' by her family. May she rest in peace.
