          I thank the member for Kennedy for his passion for ensuring that we move forward with the vital water infrastructure projects that our country needs—not just the north of Australia but how that can support the rest of the country, which I know motivates him as well. He will know that we worked closely with him to establish the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority in March of this year, and that is taking forward a number of major projects of which he's very familiar. Those include the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Gate" rel="nofollow">
           Hells Gate
          </a>
          Dam, which includes the Big Rocks Weir—and that's a $54 million commitment at this point—and, of course, the Hughenden irrigation scheme, which is a very significant project in the member's electorate. There is $182 million committed to it. There's the Rookwood Weir of $176 million. There's the Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme and the Nogoa Mackenzie Water Supply Scheme.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Hells Gate Dam is a critical piece of infrastructure.

          </a>
          this year, the Hells Gate project took another step forward, with Townsville Enterprise Limited selected to start the preconstruction and planning work on that project. The coalition is also investing up to $24 million in that part of the project, and there's $30 million to fast track the construction of the Big Rocks Weir. This is coming out of the $500 million expansion of the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. That fund, together with further work being done by the Deputy Prime Minister, is to bring forward the National Water Grid, and the National Water Grid is Bradfield for the 21st century. That's what is necessary in this country. And, as the National Water Grid is brought together by Deputy Prime Minister, working with communities—working with agricultural communities—and all of those who are so essential to the success of this project, we will be bringing forward that National Water Grid to deliver on the very initiatives that the member has determined.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have a policy to ensure that our agricultural sector reaches that $100 billion mark by 2030. And that means ensuring we have the water infrastructure and the soils to produce that so that we can become, and continue to become, the food bowl of the nation for nations like Vietnam and Indonesia and the Philippines, which you've referred to. But not just them—all around the country. So I want to thank the member for Kennedy for his commitment to this project and many other projects, and thank, particularly, all of my members on this side of the House who are so keen to see us get on with those water infrastructure projects, and that's exactly what my government will do.
