       <p>
        I've got a very brief statement to inform members of something they should know about. I'm pleased to advise the House that, obviously along with a number of other agencies, the Department of Parliamentary Services has worked with Services Australia to redeploy 55
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
         DPS
        </a>
        staff who are available to help in the national effort. Amongst other things, they are processing the many thousands of jobseeker payment claims. Having received full training from Services Australia at its Tuggeranong office, the DPS staff are currently processing around 200 claims a day. A number of Hansard staff have also been seconded to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        to assist with accurate and timely messaging, which they're good at.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also pleased to advise that DPS has worked collaboratively with Services Australia to establish a satellite processing centre here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Currently 32 staff are working out of the Dame Enid Lyons Alcove and the Sir Richard Baker Room. That space is available because our dining rooms in the alcoves are closed. The remaining staff who are working at Tuggeranong will return to work with them within the next week. This centre at Parliament House is important because it provides flexibility to process jobseeker payment claims. Any DPS staff who need to suspend their work to go and do work at the parliament are able to do that and return to their duties and keep everything moving here.
