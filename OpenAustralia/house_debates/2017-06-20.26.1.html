       <p>
        On 28 June I am heading out to Diamond Creek East Primary School for their inaugural Brain Fitness Conference. Led by Dr Maria Ruberto, a renowned psychologist with over 15 years of clinical and industry experience, the school is running a new and empowering two-day conference for grade 5 and 6 students. The brain conference is designed to help students manage their own wellbeing and brain health and to develop optimistic behaviours.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is so important that all students develop lifelong cognitive skills that promote an understanding of how individuals learn best, and that is exactly what this conference is about. The Diamond Creek East Primary School students will learn how to develop a psyche of resilience, foster their optimistic thinking and build an overall sense of wellbeing and strong mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a world increasingly run by social media, we see a rise in cyberbullying and mental illness. The important skills covered in the conference will help the students in tackling these issues and harnessing their strengths and potential. The brain conference will cover aspects of how the human brain works and how students can develop a growth mindset. The school will teach strategies for proper nutrition and the importance of sleep and will explore the vital links between gratitude, thankfulness, and the development of an optimistic outlook.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am so proud to be involved with this fantastic project and proud that schools such as Diamond Creek East Primary School, under the leadership of Rob Rostolis, are taking steps into the future and teaching their students good brain practices to set them up for a lifetime of success. I hope to see schools throughout my electorate, as well as all over Australia, take the initiative and run programs to teach their students such pivotal life skills.
