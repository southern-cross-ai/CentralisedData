       <p>
        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present
        <i>
         Report 149
        </i>
        incorporating a dissenting report. Treaty tabled 10 February 2015 and
        <i>
         Report 150
        </i>
        incorporating a dissenting report. Treaties tabled on 3 March, 5 March and 12 May 2015. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I present two reports for the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties:
        <i>
         Report 149
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Report 150.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Report 149
        </i>
        contains the committee's views on recent amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn_Convention" rel="nofollow">
         Bonn Convention
        </a>
        and
        <i>
         Report 150
        </i>
        contains views on three proposed treaty actions: Australia's withdrawal from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         World Tourism Organisation
        </a>
        , the International Maritime Organisation's Instrument Implementation Code and the extension of the treaty between Australia and the Netherlands with regard to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines" rel="nofollow">
         Malaysia Airlines
        </a>
        Flight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MH" rel="nofollow">

        17 disaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bonn Convention seeks to conserve land, bird and fish species that migrate across or outside national boundaries. The amendments have added 31 species to the Bonn Convention. However, Australia has lodged a reservation to adding five of the shark species to the convention. We understand that the reservation has raised concern in some quarters but the committee is satisfied that it is necessary in this instance. A number of these species are occasionally caught by recreational fishers in Australian waters. If the reservation had not been made, recreational fishers would break the law every time they caught a member of these species.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia proposes to withdraw from the World Tourism Organisation. Australia re-joined the organisation in 2004 but since then membership fees have increased 92 per cent. There appear to be limited benefits to Australia's tourism industry from membership of the organisation and there are claims that we are not receiving value for money. The committee is aware that the decision can be reversed, as it has been in the past, if institutions or national priorities change.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Maritime Organisation's Instrument Implementation Code provides a mandatory audit scheme aimed at improving maritime safety. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO" rel="nofollow">
         IMO
        </a>
        is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        agency responsible for the safety, security and environmental performance of international shipping. A range of relevant IMO conventions will need to be amended to make sure the code applies to regulations such as fire safety and management and environmental standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Making the scheme mandatory will encourage ongoing compliance and help the IMO identify countries that require assistance to meet its standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, the treaty arrangements that were put in place in late 2014 to facilitate the recovery effort after the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 are due to expire on 1 August 2015. There is still work to be done, and Australian personnel are likely to remain in the Netherlands beyond that date. The original treaty needs to be extended to ensure their ongoing protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee supports the withdrawal of Australia from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNWTO" rel="nofollow">
         UNWTO
        </a>
        and the ratification of the remaining treaties in these two reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I commend the reports to the House.
