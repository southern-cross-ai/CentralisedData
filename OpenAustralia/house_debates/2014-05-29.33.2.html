       <p>
        Last week I was very pleased to visit the women's employment service Fitted for Work in Melbourne. I talked with clients and staff about the incredible work they do helping disadvantaged women to get work—and to keep it. Last year alone, Fitted for Work assisted more than 3,000 women to get a job.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the great pleasure of meeting two of those women on my visit—Carol and Claudia, two women who are currently reskilling and retraining themselves and looking for work. Their stories were of great strength and perseverance. And they described their experience with Fitted for Work as truly transformative. With the help of Fitted for Work, these two women are now ready for work, and they looked great. I have no doubt that they will go on to take up new opportunities and build successful careers in whatever they choose to do.

        , women of all ages face barriers to work that are different to those faced by men. Fitted for Work's dedicated team of volunteers is assisting these women to overcome these challenges. Their results speak for themselves. Around 75 per cent of the women assisted by Fitted for Work find employment within three months of their first visit. It is a remarkable service, run by a group of remarkable women. I want to give them huge congratulations that they are delivering so much for so many.
