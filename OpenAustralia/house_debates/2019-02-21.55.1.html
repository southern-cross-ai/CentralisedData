Up there he is saying: 'We're not going to do a car park in the hospital. We will do a study of a car park.' You have to study these things over 12 months. He wants a pre-election pledge so you have to vote for them again for it to happen. This entire Redlands Labor lot have been #hampered, their entire reputation in the community #wrecked. When the Labor Party sees a road with 11 bottlenecks, instead of duplicating it like the

        offered to for $55 million, they upgrade one intersection and create 13 bottlenecks. If you are trying to get to work and you've got a Labor government, you're going to be sitting on a bus in a traffic jam because they simply won't upgrade the roads.
