        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister update the House on action the government is taking to further strengthen the security at Australian airports? Why is proactive action needed to keep Australians safe?

         I would like to thank the member for Banks for his question. I note the member for Banks's keen interest in all matters relating to national security. As you would be aware and I'm sure all members are aware, the government takes the safety of all Australians as its utmost priority. One area of public policy in which the Prime Minister himself has indicated there is never a cause for set and forget is in relation to transport security. As a government we are working to be eternally vigilant to make sure we can protect Australians from those who seek to do us harm.

          I'm surprised those opposite are seeking to interject during a conversation on national security. I'd encourage the member for McMahon to quiet down for a second and appreciate the comments I am making in relation to the security of people as they travel through Australia's major airports. The Office of Transport Security is working with the government on new and emerging threats. One of those threats is that of the insider threat. I announced over the weekend a new measure dealing with nine of Australia's major airports that focuses on the insider threat. When we talk about the insider threat, we're talking about those two have privileged access to parts of an airport where they may have the opportunity to seek to do us harm if that is their ambition.
         </p>
         <p>
          Members will recall amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act that passed the parliament earlier this year. I acknowledge the member for Grayndler, who engaged constructively at that time in relation to the measures we took under those amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act. The new regulations that came from those amendments dealt with improved access control, random screening for explosives and also additional airside security training.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are in the order of 140,000 people who have what we call ASIC—aviation security identification cards. That allows them, through their various roles at our airports, whether they're baggage handlers, engineers or involved with catering, to have access to secure areas of our airports. The vast majority of those people, I must emphasise, are there to do the right thing. They want to do their job. They want to go home safe. They want to keep us safe as we go about our travels. There is a capacity, though, for those who would seek to do us harm to do so. What we have introduced is random and unpredictable explosive trace detection tests both at screening points and in the workplace, so there's a capacity for random checks of ASIC holders as they go about their jobs. There is an opportunity for additional training in security matters to make sure that all ASIC holders are aware of their responsibilities to be vigilant in the workplace. These measures are aimed at keeping Australians safer. They will be progressively implemented over coming months. We expect full implementation at our nine major airports by January 2019.
         </p>
         <p>
          More broadly, I indicate that the Inspector of Transport Security is also undertaking a review into 173 regulated airports. He will report back to me by Christmas. We are taking action to make our strong system even stronger.
