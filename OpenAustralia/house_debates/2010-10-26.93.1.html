       <p>
        I would like to relate to the House the stories of two Local Sporting Champions grants that were recently awarded in the electorate of Deakin. The Local Sporting Champions program is a Labor government initiative designed to provide financial assistance for young people aged 12 to 18 towards the cost of travel, accommodation, uniforms and equipment when competing, coaching or officiating at official national sporting organisation endorsed state or national competitions or School Sport Australia national championships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I was proud to present five members from the Ringwood Swimming Club with a Local Sporting Champions certificate to recognise their success at a national level. Ringwood Swimming Club received a $3,000 Local Sporting Champions team grant to help send the team to the state titles in Tasmania. I was pleased to support their application for the grant, as attending the state titles in Tasmania gives the athletes from Ringwood Swimming Club important competitive experience. Ringwood Swimming Club has been active in the local community for over 75 years and helps children and adults in the area to participate in swimming events and develop their talents. Over recent years the club has retained a strong membership base and enjoyed an increasing level of competitive success at both state and national competitions. The number of Ringwood Swimming Club members qualifying and making the finals in state championships has risen significantly and gold, silver and bronze medals have been won across a number of age groups. Along with the swimmers who attended the Tasmanian titles, a number of parents volunteered their time to ensure the team could attend. I would like to thank them for that participation as well.

        Competing on a national level is important in the development of sporting careers. I am glad that the Labor government can help local athletes attend national events. Another local recipient of the Local Sporting Champions grants was Liam DeJong. Liam received a $500 individual grant to assist in his travels to Canberra so that he could compete at the National Sports Acrobatics Championships, representing Victoria. At the national championship, Liam and three fellow acrobats won their competition, which was a great result. He has represented Victoria nationally on three occasions and recently tried out for the

        , where I visited recently to see Liam run through some of his routines. I was very impressed with his dedication and commitment to making it as a gymnast. I am hopeful that he does get into the

        , a result he will know very soon. I commend this excellent federal program. It is yet another example of how the Gillard Labor government is helping to support local communities not only in the electorate of Deakin but across every electorate in Australia.
