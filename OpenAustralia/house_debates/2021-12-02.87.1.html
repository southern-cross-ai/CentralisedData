        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Will the minister please update the House on how the management of Australia's international border has been crucial to our successful outcomes in relation to the pandemic? Will the minister further detail the important work being done every day by the Australian Border Force?

          <p>
           There is absolutely no doubt that the very strong and decisive action that this government took in March of last year to successfully manage our borders has saved lives and has contributed to the health outcomes that we have nowâ€”outcomes, quite frankly, that are the envy of the world. But it has been a challenge to close our borders and still ensure that we receive the critical goods that Australia needs. That includes critical supplies of vaccines and personal protective equipment. It includes products that businesses rely on every single day. And, of course, it includes international mail. It's been an absolute challenge to close our borders but still facilitate travel for those who absolutely had to do so for compassionate reasons or for very important work purposes. It's been a challenge to put in place the new systems that we have so that we can safely reopen our border for vaccinated Australians, as we did last month.
          </p>
          <p>
           But, at every step, the men and women of the Australian Border Force have proved that they are more than capable of meeting the challenges that the pandemic has presented to them. It's certainly been tough, and, as a government, we're very mindful of the impact that changes to our border settings have had on individuals, on families and, of course, on our businesses. Our Australian Border Force officials have been on the front line of this particular issue and dealing with people who are often in very distressing situations. They've certainly helped grieving people through our airports and our quarantine systems. They've worked with businesses to secure vital supply chains through our ports. They've made record seizures of illicit drugs to help keep our communities safe. And, all that time, they have patrolled our oceans to make sure that our borders are secure and to keep people smugglers out and make sure that they cannot ply their evil trade during the pandemic and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, on behalf of the government of Australia, I'm very proud to thank the men and women of the Australian Border Force for the tremendous work that they have done, particularly through this year. To Commissioner Outram and his team of over 5,000 officers and staff, who work every single day to keep Australians safe and to secure our interests: a sincere thank you to you. Our nation is made much stronger by the critical work that you do for us, often in very difficult circumstances. A very merry Christmas, and a safe Christmas to everyone.
