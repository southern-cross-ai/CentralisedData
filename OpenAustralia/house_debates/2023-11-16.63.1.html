        Today I'll be reading a speech written by a Bennelong local. Ross Theo is 16 years old and this speech was submitted through the Raise Our Voice initiative. He said: 'I imagine an Australia in which every young person, regardless of their background or religion, has access to high-quality education. I want to see a country where opportunities are not limited by certain circumstances but rather where everyone's abilities are developed and ambitions are manifested. In this better Australia we must also embrace environmental responsibility as a core value. Let us be known by taking these urgent steps to make Australia what it fully represents. It is by ensuring we promote a healthy and prosperous environment for future generations. We as Australians should feel compelled to foster and care for a culture that appreciates both diversity and equality. It is now time to build a country in which everyone is treated with both common decency and respect, regardless of race, gender or heritage. We must promote a stronger and more united nation that thrives on its differences by breaking down these barriers and speaking for those who are disadvantaged. Let us strengthen the bonds between generations. We must pave a path for a unique Australia by investing in education, prioritising long-term sustainability, promoting equality for all and creating intergenerational connections and future ancestries.'
       </p>

        Thank you, Ross. It's been a tough week in this place and your speech is a timely reminder of the issues that we should all be focused on.
