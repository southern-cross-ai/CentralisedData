       <p>
        It is a tremendous honour to stand before the 46th Parliament as a representative for the people of Herbert—Townsville—to speak for the first time in this chamber. I would like to start by acknowledging our current and former Defence Force members, our brothers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice on operations in service to this nation and our many veterans who have succumbed to their war within back here on home soil.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stand before you humbled and proud to be the elected member through a democratic process that I love and have defended. The people of Herbert have put their faith in me, and I'm determined not to let them down. That is my one-year-old baby girl, Astin. And I am happy she is making noise, because that's why we are in this place: because we want a better Australia for our future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honourable members: Hear, hear!
       </p>
       <p>
        This responsibility and honour is the same sense of duty I felt as an infantry soldier in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . My core values are protecting the Australian way of life, freedom of speech, family and reward for effort—values that I do my best to live by every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The powerful electorate of Herbert—the heart of Townsville—is 941 square kilometres which incorporates the iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Stuart" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Stuart
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Castle Hill
        </a>
        and takes in the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Magnetic Island
        </a>
        . Any local will tell you it's a hidden gem we're lucky to have on our doorstep. An iconic part of Herbert is the Aboriginal community located on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Palm_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Great Palm Island
        </a>
        . Palm Island is home to the traditional owners the Manbarra people and Bwgcolman people and their descendants. I would like to acknowledge those people in this place today. It is my commitment to ensure that Palm Island, which is a part of the electorate of Herbert, will have a strong voice here in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Palm Island is close to my heart—the birthplace of my mother-in-law, Florence Burns. Flo; my wife, Jenna; and my beautiful daughter, Astin, are all Aboriginal women who are here in the gallery today. As I stand and look at these three remarkable humans, I have no doubt that, as three generations of Aboriginal women, their rights have improved dramatically over the decades. But we must not forget there is still a lot of work to be done in recognising and valuing our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people and their culture. I'm honoured to be a member of the House Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs and I'll be working to make a meaningful and positive contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've had some extremely proud moments in my life, which include being the youngest member of this House of the 46th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament of Australia
        </a>
        , being the 2018 Queensland Young Australian of the Year and serving our wonderful nation as an infantry soldier. However, no title or award compares or comes close to my greatest achievement: being called Dad. Whilst I acknowledge I will spend time away from my family to be in this House, it is because of the strength and support of my wife and my family that I stand before you representing the people of Herbert.
       </p>
       <p>
        Herbert is, in my view, the best electorate in this nation. It has a heart like no other. We have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        listed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        —the world's largest coral reef system—on our doorstep. I stand proudly in this House today as a member of a government which is making record investment in ensuring this incredible natural wonder remains healthy for generations to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Herbert also has both copper and zinc refineries, a strong fishing industry and a strong desire to grow its tourism offering. The port of Townsville is northern Australia's largest general cargo and container port, and a direct transport link to many important global markets. The port is Australia's leading exporter of zinc, lead, sugar, fertiliser and molasses. With upgrades and new builds underway, trade is expected to treble over the next 30 years. I commend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , Ranee Crosby, on her incredible efforts in driving the success of the port over many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Townsville is proudly home to

         Tropical Queensland
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Townsville is also the largest garrison city. I'd like to acknowledge the Royal Australian Air Force's presence at Garbutt and, of course—a place I know well—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Lavarack Barracks
        </a>
        . Townsville became my home in 2006 when I was posted to the 1st Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        . I deployed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        in 2007, and in 2009, at the age of 21, I deployed to Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst deployed to Afghanistan, on 18 July 2009 a warrior was killed in action. His name is Ben Ranaudo, and I honour him in this House. My good friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Warren
        </a>
        lost his leg in the same blast, and, I honour his service and sacrifice in this House today. It's a day I'll never forget. It was a sickening feeling, hearing over the radio that an improvised explosive device had detonated and that an Australian was killed and another was critically wounded. After we sent our brother home via ramp ceremony in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
         Tarin Kowt
        </a>
        , we kept Ben in our hearts and Paul's recovery in our thoughts, but it was back to the patrol base, because our deployment was far from over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Improvised explosive devices were the weapon of choice used by insurgents. We had many near misses, and only on limited occasions did we get to do our role: seek out and close with the enemy. On 19 October 2009, my life changed forever. Whilst on a combined Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan National Army
        </a>
        dismounted patrol, I was wounded in action by an improvised explosive device. As a result of the blast, I sustained severe injuries and was medically evacuated back to Australia. As well as the obvious physical injuries from the blast, I also suffered a traumatic brain injury and several other life-changing conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        On deployment to Afghanistan, I've had friends be killed in action, lose limbs and be critically injured. Many have also suffered from lifelong psychological invisible wounds from their deployment. I, like many others, went through a very dark and terrible place after war. My post-traumatic growth came from the strength of my wife, Jenna, who encouraged me to find meaningful engagement, which was then followed by employment. Having meaning and accountability changed how I thought and acted and gave purpose to a life which at that point had been written off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not all the brothers I served with came out the other side. Today is the anniversary of when I buried a close friend who died by suicide. His name was Jesse Bird, and I honour him in this place today. I have buried too many of my mates, mothers have buried too many of their sons, wives have buried too many of their husbands and fathers, and a nation has buried too many of its veterans. Mental illness and suicide prevention is our responsibility; we are all responsible. Suicide is not just a veteran issue and not just a Defence Force issue; it's a societal problem. We can and must do more. There is nothing more precious than life and living your life well. With difficult topics, there can be an 'out of mind, out of sight' mentality. I will ensure that in this place we will never forget that there is always more we can do to help.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I stand before you, I confess: I'm no saint. I've made mistakes and done and said things in my past that I'm not proud of. The harsh lessons that I've learnt from those dark times equip me to better serve the people of Herbert.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm the eldest of three children raised by a single mother, who shaped the man I am today. I acknowledge and thank her in this House today. We did it tough growing up, which cemented my ethos that with hard work and determination we can achieve great things. This has echoed with my siblings—my sister, Stephanie Thompson, a nurse, and my brother,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Timothy Thompson
        </a>
        , a property consultant. We worked hard and fought for everything we achieved. I hope to be a role model for people who didn't have the best shoes growing up, who watched other families go on holidays, who learnt the hard way that we're not all born equal, not all the same. But it's my belief that with hard work, determination and a fighting spirit we can have equal opportunity. 'A fair go for those who have a go' couldn't be a more relevant statement to how we were raised. I work every day to be a better man than I was yesterday, and it is a spirit which I vow to bring with me to this place each and every day as I give the people of Herbert a voice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year, Townsville suffered a devastating natural disaster—a flood event like no other. Tens of thousands of people have been impacted. The night the text warnings started to come in about the release of water from the dam was truly terrifying. No-one knew what to expect, and there really was a feeling for many people that the world we knew was coming to an end. Whole suburbs went under water. Many people are still displaced. Others are living in damaged homes and are trying to battle on. Through the devastation I saw our community come together—the military, emergency services and hundreds of people on boats rescuing others from their flood engulfed streets; shopping centres doubling as recovery centres; and normal, everyday people opening up their homes to strangers who had lost everything. Tragic stories of people who had lost everything were quickly followed by selfless acts of the community supporting one another. Our tragedy has brought our community closer than ever. The resilience of our region is remarkable. The number of ordinary people doing extraordinary things to help others will never be forgotten. It makes me so proud to say I'm from Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our city has done it tough, and we need to be at the forefront of projects and economic drivers. But we are a proud bunch: we don't want a handout; we want a hand up. I want to see the Herbert electorate prosper again, to be a region where there is opportunity and reward for effort and a city in which we can have great confidence in the future. Water security, affordable electricity and job creation are critical pieces of the economic puzzle and must be treated as such. Small and medium businesses are the engine room of the local economy, and I want Townsville businesses to have confidence to take risk, be rewarded and drive our local economy for years to come. Herbert has high unemployment, a topic often thrown around like a political football. The time is now, when we make strong leadership decisions and back projects that will create jobs for years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to say I back the resource sector. I'm from a part of the country where coal isn't a dirty word and we support opening up the Galilee Basin and welcome the jobs that will come with it. Our community will not be told what projects we can support, what jobs we can have and what industries we can work in by people lacking any sort of local knowledge and understanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe Townsville has the potential to be Australia's northern defence deep-maintenance, sustainment and logistics hub. There is enormous untapped potential in our region. Townsville is the key economic hub for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        and an industry powerhouse. Backing projects like the Townsville port widening project and the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative, which create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth is what I will do every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism has been on the backburner for far too long in Townsville. That's why I backed the Museum of Underwater Art, which is the first of its kind in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        . We're also funding a zip-line down Castle Hill and providing a NAIF loan for the upgrade of the Townsville airport, which will see more flights to Townsville and more people travelling to the beautiful north to experience the magnificent wonders of our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        A strong north means a strong nation, and to have a strong north we must get back to nation-building projects that have clear long-term economic value. The coalition support of the Hells Gate Dam is a no-brainer. The large-scale agricultural development will have long-term benefits for our farmers, our exports and our industry more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        : I thank you for your leadership, guidance and a helpful ear during the campaign. I also thank Mrs Morrison, who spent considerable time with my wife and daughter. We both appreciated it. I have had a lot of support from colleagues but extensive support from the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        , and the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Matt Canavan. I appreciate the time they have invested in me. I would like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        and its members, who have shown great faith in me.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a more personal note, I have tremendous people in my life. First and foremost is the mother of my beautiful daughter, Jenna Thompson. She is a woman who, at the age of 21, nursed me back to health and literally saved my life. Jenna, you are an incredible woman who I love and adore and you are the driving force behind any success I have. My one-year-old daughter, Astin, can brighten up the most challenging days. Her first word was 'Dad', a moment that still brings a tear to my eye. Her laugh, cheeky smile and beautiful personality are what I look forward to at the end of a long day. Having my daughter here today fills my heart with pride and love.
       </p>
       <p>
        On my campaign manager and close friend, Casie Scott, I would not be standing in this place without her help and guidance. Casie is a truly remarkable, selfless person. During a political campaign, there's often a saying that every campaign needs a 'blank'. In my case, everyone needs a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brennan" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Brennan
        </a>
        , an Anthony Meixner, a Dino da Bella, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Sinclair" rel="nofollow">
         Laura Sinclair
        </a>
        and a Marie McMullen. These volunteers gave up hours upon hours of their time to help letterbox, doorknock, fundraise, man stalls, set up, pack down and just be involved. Our grassroots volunteers are why we were successful in Herbert. Regardless of what colour shirt you wear, everyone in this House is lucky to have people who are passionate enough about the future of our nation that they stump up for us time and time again.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had so much support through our country from all walks of life but especially from the defence and veteran community, and I cannot thank them enough. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I'll continue to put a spotlight on veterans' issues in the hope of driving better outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, my focus is to represent the people of Herbert with passion and integrity. I make this pledge to the people of Townsville: I will be your voice in Canberra every single day of the week. I will choose you, the people of Townsville, first. That means people before politics. I will back projects that create jobs and economic drivers for our region to ensure we have a bright and prosperous future for our children. I will listen to you, the people of Townsville, and will work hard to find solutions to your problems. I will never think I'm above you, the people who have put their faith and trust in me and given me the great privilege of standing in this House today. Integrity is everything, and I promise I will not forget that. Thank you.

          <p>
           Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Prime Minister for the privilege of participating in the address-in-reply here today, and I commend the member for Herbert on his very moving first speech. I also acknowledge that the very first duty of our new Governor-General was the opening of this 46th
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Parliament of Australia
           </a>
           . I wish General and Mrs Hurley the very best as they embark on their official duties. I also congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your re-election to the chair. The commentary from both sides of this chamber reflects the high regard in which you are held.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like all members elected to this place, I am tremendously humbled by the faith shown in me by the people of my electorate of Bass, and I will do my utmost as their member of parliament to repay the trust that they have shown. I hope that my address today will highlight the many reasons why I wish to serve as a genuine and authentic representative for the community of Northern Tasmania. If there was one disappointment in my election to the nation's parliament, it is that I had to relinquish my role as mayor of the municipality of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
            George Town
           </a>
           and as a member of that council. Many members on all sides of this chamber first had the experience of being elected to local government and, in many ways, it is the tier of government that is closest to the people. I believe it provides valuable experience to those who go on to other elected office.
          </p>
          <p>
           Among the highlights of George Town, the town centre of the municipality, is the Bass and Flinders Centre. It is a remarkable interpretive centre and very popular with visitors. The centre jointly honours the remarkable lives of

           in 1798. George Bass, for whom the electorate was named, was a naval surgeon and amateur botanist. It was his study of the plants in Tasmania that convinced him it was separated from the mainland. After the
           <i>
            Norfolk

           crew proved that to be the case and returned to Sydney, Flinders successfully petitioned

           .
          </p>
          <p>
           I am proud to be the first Liberal woman to represent the electorate of Bass. I am only the second Liberal woman to represent a House of Representatives seat in Tasmania, after the remarkable
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Enid_Lyons" rel="nofollow">
            Dame Enid Lyons
           </a>
           , who was, of course, the first ever woman elected to this House. May I say it is appropriate, too, that George Bass was a surgeon, because I believe that will serve as a reminder to me of how vital the provision of health services are in Northern Tasmania. Bass, like the rest of Tasmania, is facing the enormous challenges of a rapidly ageing population and the pressure that inevitably brings to health professionals and providers. I am in awe of the contribution that the staff of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
            Launceston General Hospital
           </a>
           make every day—and 24 hours of every day—as do their colleagues at the private hospitals in Launceston,

            St Luke's

           , and the nursing homes, noting that I have a particular affinity with the excellent work that staff do for the residents at Ainslie House at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Head" rel="nofollow">

           near George Town.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Launceston General Hospital has built up a strong reputation over more than a century. One of the developments over the last 20 years or so has been the advent of the Clifford Craig medical research foundation at the hospital. It has been strongly supported by Northern Tasmanians and has supported groundbreaking research, especially in areas of aged care and age related disease such as dementia. It will be my hope as the member for Bass to work hand in hand with the Tasmanian Liberal government and the new state health minister, Sarah Courtney, who is also a state member for Bass, to fully support those who work in the health sector. Tackling the challenges of an ageing demographic is one area of priority.
          </p>
          <p>
           Another area of priority is the exciting prospect of the development of the Inveresk campus of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
            University of Tasmania
           </a>
           . This is one of the most significant public infrastructure developments Launceston has seen in decades and heralds exciting possibilities in linking town and gown. Whilst it has taken some time to reach this stage, it is so important to get this project right for the future. We all know that universities are vital places for learning and allowing people to attain qualifications and skills, but what is often underestimated is just how significant a university campus can be to the economy of a regional centre. My colleagues from Armidale and Townsville and other places will know exactly what I mean. I see very positive signs from the university's plans, coupled with the city deal that the federal government has initiated, for new and sustainable long-term jobs in Northern Tasmania.
          </p>
          <p>
           When my predecessor, Ross Hart, spoke about the outcome of the election on 18 May, he ruefully said that he had become one of what he called a long line of distinguished members for Bass who have served only one term. It is certainly true that Bass has been somewhat volatile in the last 20 or so years. In fact, the last members for Bass to have any longevity were
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Newman" rel="nofollow">
            Kevin Newman
           </a>
           , a minister in the Fraser government, and his immediate predecessor,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Barnard" rel="nofollow">
            Lance Barnard
           </a>
           , the Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government, and of course more recently
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Smith" rel="nofollow">
            Warwick Smith
           </a>
           , a minister in John Howard's government. The most recent Liberal member for Bass,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nikolic" rel="nofollow">
            Andrew Nikolic
           </a>
           , was a strong representative for Bass and the first in my view to fight seriously for funds to improve the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">
            Tamar River
           </a>
           . He worked hard on the issue with the then environment minister, the member for Flinders, and I look forward to continuing that work because, whilst there has been improvement, there is still much to be done. Without care of our waterways, as we all know, we significantly degrade our local environment, limit our agricultural growth capacity and ignore the opportunities for tourism and recreation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The recent changes in the electoral boundaries of Bass brought both sides of the Tamar River into the one electoral division, and I would like to commend the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Electoral Commission
           </a>
           for making this change, because it more properly reflects the communities of interest of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_Valley" rel="nofollow">
            Tamar Valley
           </a>
           . The other facet of this change is that it will allow me in this place to promote the burgeoning tourism attractions of the entire Tamar Valley. Many honourable members will be aware of the many excellent vineyards on both sides of the river and the north-east hinterlands, but fewer may know of initiatives such as the annual Tamar Valley Writers Festival, which has quickly become one of the largest writers festivals outside any Australian capital city, attracting world-famous authors and booksellers and book lovers and encouraging people to read and enjoy the world of literature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Northern Tasmania is a fantastic place to live, and I am excited by the opportunity to grow the population as more and more people discover our enviable lifestyle. We have important manufacturing and forest industries, established farming areas, a growing food and wine scene and an expanding tourism industry spurred on by arts, sports and adventure tourism experiences like the world-famous mountain biking trails of Derby. Increasingly, Northern Tasmania is becoming a centre for innovation, collaboration and entrepreneurship. Launceston is being transformed as the city embraces its heritage and future alike, with the Launceston City Deal driving that transformation. Our community has witnessed a re-imagining of the waterfront through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            North Bank
           </a>
           and seaport precincts, urban development and pedestrian and cycle pathways.

            If I
           </a>
           were to borrow a now familiar phrase, 'How good is Northern Tasmania?'
          </p>
          <p>
           I am so proud to be standing here as the voice for northern Tasmanians. I worked very hard to make sure that my campaign for election was about understanding the needs, ambitions and aspirations of our community in Launceston and right out into the regional heartland of Bass—from Winnaleah to Whitemark, Riverside to Ringarooma and everywhere in between. I am proud of my record of standing up for the Tasmanian way of life, and I'm so motivated by the opportunities that lay before us. As a government we want to create stronger employment opportunities for our region, expanding quality infrastructure and securing more investment in health and education.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those who know me will attest that I am far more interested in hearing other people's stories than in telling my own. I think, in large part, it is because I find my own childhood story painful and difficult to tell—and never more so than today in this place. I am reminded, though, that my presence here is not about me and my story; it is about hearing and reflecting the stories of the people in my electorate.
          </p>
          <p>
           I come from humble beginnings, like many who have stood here before me, growing up in a working-class suburb of Launceston, and many of my childhood memories are not so happy. Like many other Australians, I have faced the challenges of living with childhood trauma, and that is a priority for me to address in my time in this place. Childhood trauma has far-reaching consequences for individuals and for our society, including significant mental health challenges. In recent years, with the help of some wonderful doctors and support services, I have finally found better ways to cope, to build resilience and strength—obviously!
          </p>
          <p>
           I share a small part of this deeply personal story today because I believe we must do more as a society to keep our children and families safe. I am proud to stand as a member of this government that has committed to do more to address the scourge of family, domestic and sexual violence. Further, I commend the Prime Minister for his leadership and determination to prioritise mental health care for all Australians. I will do my utmost to prioritise and support those aims.
          </p>
          <p>
           As an adult, I have struggled at times to find my way in the world and, indeed, my place in it. I worked in a variety of mostly casual administrative and hospitality jobs for many years before returning to university study. It was there, at the University of Tasmania, that I first discovered an interest in politics, attaining a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" rel="nofollow">
            Bachelor of Arts
           </a>
           with majors in English and political science, and later a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Certificate" rel="nofollow">
            Graduate Certificate
           </a>
           in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Politics" rel="nofollow">
            International Politics
           </a>
           . Not too long after that I met my now husband, Winston, and moved from Launceston to join him on his family farm just outside George Town, where we live now with our five children and a few beef cattle and sheep.
          </p>
          <p>
           Shortly after moving to George Town, away from my friends and in an unfamiliar town, my husband suggested that I might consider standing as a candidate in the next council elections as a way of getting to know some new people! It was, indeed, a great way to meet people, and I was fortunate to be elected to the position of councillor in 2009, deputy mayor in 2011 and mayor in both 2014 and 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
           During those years, the council underwent some very challenging times and has seen some significant change, but I am confident that I leave the council in good stead—financially sustainable and with improved governance and workplace culture. The area has a very bright future ahead and I look forward to continuing to contribute, albeit in a different capacity. Importantly, I think local government provides accessibility and, consequently, accountability to those we represent, and I intend to continue to have that relationship with my constituents in Bass.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's very interesting to reflect on some of the election results in the seat of Bass. There is no doubt that I entered the campaign very much as the underdog. But as the campaign progressed it became evident that there was a disconnect between what we were seeing and hearing in the media and what constituents were telling us on the ground. Some of the biggest swings towards the Liberal Party were in polling booth in Launceston's northern and eastern suburbs, areas where Labor has traditionally polled strongly. Rocherlea, for example, had a greater than 15 per cent swing against Labor after preferences, and there were strong swings in Waverley and Ravenswood as well. Much has been said about Labor losing touch with their traditional base. That is a matter for others to decide, but the strong message for me is that the Liberal Party has reconnected with our own base—the everyday, quiet Australians making their way in the world, taking personal responsibility, working hard, raising families, aspiring to live their best lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to reflect on the role that the Prime Minister played in supporting our campaign in Bass, which I think is reflective of the leadership style that has united our party and resonated with those quiet Australians. The Prime Minister visited Bass many times during the campaign and, along with Mrs Morrison, spent much time simply talking with people, listening to their stories and engaging with genuine warmth and sincerity. He was equally as comfortable with business and community leaders as he was enjoying a game of pool and a parmie at the Sporties Hotel and, most memorably, at a visit to the Bridgenorth football club that was the home of the Parrots—

             And J Rod. Elections being what they are, we were there to announce a funding commitment for the upgrade of facilities, but the evening turned into so much more than that. Some national commentators called it the turning point of the campaign as it entered the final few days to 18 May. There was a wonderful energy at the club that night, and the Prime Minister and Mrs Morrison were generous with both their time and enthusiasm—indeed, right up until election day, with a surprise visit to Bass on the morning of the polls, which, as it happened, was also my birthday. I take this opportunity to thank the Morrisons for all of their support. It was an attitude displayed by all of the ministers who visited Bass throughout the campaign—genuine, authentic and engaged with the local issues. I thank all of my colleagues in this place for their support and encouragement and for the very warm welcome you have shown me as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would like to acknowledge publicly the work of my predecessor, Ross Hart. Ross is a decent man, a caring and hardworking person with a strong history of community service. Despite the unenviable position of serving his electorate in opposition, I know he worked very hard in his time in office and advocated strongly for his constituents, and I wish Ross every success and happiness in his future endeavours.
            </p>
            <p>
             Marginal seats speak for the nation and ensure elected members aren't complacent or take their communities for granted. I understand the importance of always listening, finding out exactly what concerns the people of Bass and taking those issues up with ministers and into our party room.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally today, I wish to pay tribute to all of those who have helped me on my journey to this place. There are so many people who contributed to the campaign, and it is not possible to thank them all by name here today. But to the Liberal Party state president,

             , and the members for putting their faith in me, for the fundraisers and the signs and the manning of polling booths, letterboxing and waving signs on the side of the road, I am so grateful for all of your support. For my campaign team, solidly led by state director Sam McQuestin, I am forever in your debt for the support and care you showed me throughout the campaign and for believing in me. A special mention to

             , who is here today, who stood on pre-poll every single day with such good-natured spirit. To Nick Pedley and Nick Carswell, who were always there to help, and Alastair Pullen for his willingness to letterbox in all weather. To Charles Headlam, Jorden Gunton and Simon Wood, who worked tirelessly every day and can always make me laugh, and Bec and Pete De Jong for the help and for the comfy shoes. A special mention to my little friend, Clancy Lilywhite; you are a shining star. My deepest thanks must also go to Tim Robertson, who has understood me from the start and who always has my back.

             In conclusion, I would like to thank my family—my mother, Marion, sister, Jessica, and brother, Gerald—my extended family and friends, and especially my dear, lifelong friends Sarah Lillywhite and Evelyn Archer. Most importantly of all, I thank my incredible husband, Winston, who always loves and supports me no matter what. To my darling children, Luke, Lauren, Edith, Molly and James: you are my whole world. I love you very much. Thank you.
