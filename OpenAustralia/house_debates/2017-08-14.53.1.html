       <p>
        At end of July I was very pleased to represent the government and open stage 6 of the Lutheran Ormeau Rivers District School—LORDS for short—building program. One of the reasons why I was especially pleased was that 11 years ago I started campaigning with a group of locals to see that school built. Those locals were there on the day—Peter and Rosslyn Grant, Ian and Kaye Rossmann, Geoff and Rhyll Rossmann and members of the Zipf family. In fact, they'd been campaigning for seven years prior to when I turned up. Together, we got the school up and running. Now, seeing a stage 6 building is extraordinary.

        The Australian government contributed $550,000 under the Capital Grants Program. The state government coughed up the same—well done—and LORDS, including the Lutheran community, contributed $888,246 for a total project cost of just under $2 million. The project saw the construction of three secondary classrooms, an under croft, which is a combined covered outdoor learning area, student amenities, a store and associated travel areas. What began as a fight in 2000 by a bunch of families and then a political fight in 2006-07 has come to such a wonderful reality out there in the Ormeau Rivers area. It was great to be there to open stage 6. Bring on stage 7, I say.
