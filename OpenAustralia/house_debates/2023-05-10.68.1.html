        <p>
         I would like to thank the member for Calwell for her question. Of course, like the member for Calwell, our government understands that many Australians are doing it tough right now. That's why we have set out through this budget a path to address some of the pressures that families are feeling right now. I would like to really congratulate the Treasurer for all the work he did in delivering what is a very responsible and targeted but important cost-of-living relief plan. Our $14.6 billion cost-of-living plan includes help with power bills, record investment in Medicare bulk billing and cheaper medicines, and, in addition, we are strengthening the safety net that so many Australians rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
         The safety net is there for when Australians need it. Through this budget we are strengthening that by increasing the eligible working age and student payment rates. We're also strengthening the Commonwealth Rent Assistance payments and expanding the eligibility for parenting payment single. Our changes will see the rates of JobSeeker, youth allowance and other eligible working-age payments rise by $40 a fortnight. This provides additional support to 1.1 million people.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are expanding the eligibility for existing higher rates of JobSeeker to single recipients aged 55 and over who have been on income support for nine months or more. The higher rate is an existing feature of our social security system that currently applies to those aged over 60. But we know older Australians face a number of additional barriers when looking for work, including age discrimination and poor health. Our changes will support 52,000 Australians aged 55 to 59, who will receive an additional $92.10 a fortnight.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, we know that single parents can find it tough to balance caring responsibilities with full-time work, and so we are expanding the eligibility for parenting payment, because we know the balancing act doesn't end when a child turns eight. And, as the Prime Minister outlined, we are increasing the support for Commonwealth Rent Assistance, the largest increase to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRA" rel="nofollow">
          CRA
         </a>
         in more than 30 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combined, these changes will provide additional support to around two million people. The Albanese government believes in a strong social safety net. We believe in supporting those doing it tough. Through our budget and our changes, we will be supporting more Australians with the cost of living.

              There is support for small and family businesses to tackle immediate pressures, particularly with high energy input costs, an asset write-off boost to help re-equip and invest in productivity, tax administration changes that will help with vital cash flow challenges and much needed advice to deal with cyber security fears …

                 I'm sure the member for Lindsay feels the same thing, but I'm sure she needs to explain to the small businesses in her electorate that she voted against it, along with all of them over there. Here are some of the things those over there called the Energy Price Relief Plan: reckless, destructive, socialism, a Soviet-style policy, catastrophic, one step short of nationalisation, gas market Armageddon and a declaration of war that will be the death knell of Australia's prosperity. That's what they had to say. How's that for support!

                    . Last night's budget had a central pillar, which was our nation's security, investing in the key military capabilities to keep Australians safe. There was a $9 billion commitment over the next four years to establish the pathway by which Australia will acquire nuclear powered submarine capability, making us just the seventh country to be able to operate these platforms, and giving rise to the single biggest leap in our military capability since the end of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    . What that will do is give pause for thought for any adversary seeking to project power against Australia or our interests. There's a $4.1 billion commitment to increasing our strike capability, which will see, for example, an increase in Army's strike range from 40 kilometres to more than 300 kilometres in the next couple of years, while at the same time establishing an industrial base in this country which will manufacture missiles. There's an investment of $400 million in the retention and the growth of our

                    personnel because we understand that at the heart of our defence is our people, and we simply have to make the ADF a better place to work.

                   <p>
                    What all of this will do is implement the AUK

                     US
                    </a>
                    agreement and the Defence Strategic Review. It will see, over the next four years, defence spending growth in accordance with the trajectory that we inherited from those opposite. But over the next 10 years, it will see defence spending grow by an additional 0.2 per cent of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                     GDP
                    </a>
                    above the trajectory that we inherited from those opposite. That means that we plan to spend, over the next 10 years, 0.2 per cent more of GDP on defence than those opposite provided. This is not spending for spending's sake, because right now we are seeing in the world the biggest conventional military build-up since the end of the Second World War right here in our region, and that, combined with a much greater economic connection to the world, has greatly complicated our strategic circumstances. In a rational world defence spending is a function of strategic threat and strategic complexity, and we have both in full measure. We are rational people running a rational government which is making a historic commitment to the defence of our country.

                      What is extraordinary when it comes to the issue of inflation is that the shadow Treasurer had this to say in February 2023 with the catastrophising that they go on with over there: 'There are ominous signs Australia is hurtling towards another era of stagflation.' That follows the comments of the Leader of the Opposition in June 2022. Think about the timing of that; it's after the election but before any of our first budgets. He said this: 'Australia is set to lose its
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
                       AAA
                      </a>
                      credit rating because of spiralling debt and deficits.' That's what he had to say. But that's a deficit in your forward estimates. It was in June 2022.

                                 The Leader of the Opposition correctly identified the spiralling debt and deficit that were in the budget that they left. That's why he said that in June 2022, because they expected a deficit this year of some $78 billion—$78 billion. But instead what you have is a massive turnaround and a forecast surplus of $4.2 billion. And yet they stand up here and ask a question and interject with those absurd comments after the biggest fiscal turnaround in history that has ever occurred.

                                   Having stood at this dispatch box, the Liberal Treasurer announced the biggest deficit in history and the second biggest deficit in history, having sat here for nine years. Having promised a surplus in the first year and a surplus every year after that, they didn't deliver any. They produced the mugs, but they were treating Australians like mugs. All they had to show for it was some empty mugs in surplus. The only surplus they had was in Josh Frydenberg's office, the mugs that they had to stop selling. The fact is that we have been responsible, and that's on top of the fact that we had to find, in addition to that, $7.5 billion in essential programs that they stopped funding in June this year or in December this year.

                                     I thank the member for Newcastle—someone who's always been fighting to get wages moving in her part of Australia. In the first six months of this government, we have had stronger wage growth than in any other period for the last 10 years. Now, why would it be over the last 10 years? What possibly needed to change, in order to get wages moving? It was the government that needed to change to get wages moving.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Getting wages moving is good for the cost of living and it's good for working families. And it's been good for the budget. Forty per cent of the turnaround in finances, as has been explained by the Treasurer, is caused by employment and wages outcomes—40 per cent of the improvements in revenue.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Now, those opposite wanted to use terms like 'drover's dog' in terms of turnaround in revenue. As to what's happened with wages, in their approach to wages they were more like my rescue greyhound: they'd run around for five minutes in the morning and then sleep the rest of the day! And they'd do nothing on wages, because keeping wages low was a deliberate design feature.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     To get wages moving requires action from a government, which is exactly what the Albanese Labor government has done. Wages are moving because we took the position we did at the annual wage review.

Wages are moving with a government that was willing to strike down zombie agreements, when those opposite were quite happy for people to still be on the terms and conditions of 20 years ago under old

Wages are moving because we changed the law for gender equality. Wages are moving because rogue employers know that it's going to be a criminal offence to steal from your workers. Wages are moving because the platforms know that there'll be minimum standards for gig workers. Wages are moving because getting wages moving is a deliberate design feature of this government.

When you look at the budget papers last night, what people are experiencing now, in what's going into their bank accounts, is because there was a change of government.

But we need the green hydrogen industry going to get the green metals industries going as well. I'm happy to confirm to the honourable member that we are focused on and limited to green hydrogen for that.

Regardless of the colour, they can see the origin, the carbon content and the antecedents—the energy—which went into that hydrogen, because that is also vital for our ambitions as a hydrogen superpower.

                                              My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women. How does this year's budget deliver for Australian women and put equality at the heart of the Australian government?

                                               I thank the member for Jagajaga very much for the question. I know the member has been fighting for all her political life and working life for equality for women. She knows, as this side of the House knows, that equality for women has to be at the heart of everything we do. Since coming to office we have made significant headway, and last night's budget takes another step forward in delivering significant investment in Australia's women and investing in programs and policies that will echo long beyond this term of parliament and permanently shift the dial on women's equality. Not since the introduction of the Women's Budget Statement back in 1984 has there been such a deliberate focus on how budget decisions affect women, which we are backing up with funding and with structural reforms.

                                               Our substantial investments include addressing violence against women; a pay rise for aged-care workers, nine out of 10 of whom are women; modernising paid parental leave and making child care cheaper; improving gender pay gap transparency; preventing sexual harassment at work; transforming our workplace relations frameworks to centre gender equality; and reintroducing gender-responsive budgeting. We're investing $1.9 billion to extend the eligibility of the parenting payment to single parents—the majority of whom are women—with a youngest dependent child aged under 14 years.

                                               We are investing $2.7 billion to increase the maximum payment rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent for all recipients, with single women making up the majority of the recipients of rental assistance. We're abolishing the punishing ParentsNext program from 1 July 2024 and replacing it with a new voluntary program that better meets and understands the needs of parents and actually sets them up for success, to commence at the earliest opportunity.

                                               We're providing over half a billion dollars in funding to support the National Plan to End Violence against Women and their Children, building on the record investment in the October budget and bringing the total investment to almost $2.3 billion to end this scourge. As I said, we're funding a 15 per cent increase to the minimum wages for aged-care workers. That is a huge change for thousands and thousands of workers across this country. We're investing $26.4 million to support health and medical research focusing on women's health.

                                               This doesn't happen by accident. It happens with purposeful decision-making, making sure that we're putting women at the heart of our budget decision-making processes. These are efforts that are led by all of us, particularly the Prime Minister, the Minister for Social Services and the Minister for Finance. This is a good budget for Australia's women.
