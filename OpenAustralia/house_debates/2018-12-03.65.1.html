         I thank the member for Dawson for his question. In the worst of times, you see the best of Australians, the best of Queenslanders. Our thoughts are with the families, the farmers and the communities across Queensland as the bushfires continue to burn. As at the latest report, eight houses have been destroyed and numerous other structures, vehicles and farm machinery have been lost. At the weekend more than 100 fires across the state were burning. At the moment there are still many that may be contained but are still very worrying to the communities that they are besetting. More than half a million hectares have been destroyed across Queensland. The members for Dawson, Capricornia and Flynn; Senator Canavan; the Assistant Minister for

         , Senator Reynolds; and I visited affected communities at the weekend. We visited communities in Central and

         , up to Mackay, to

          Finch Hatton
         </a>
         and up the range to Eungella. At the evacuation centre in Miriam Vale the member for Flynn and I met people who've lost their houses; they've lost everything. Despite that, they are in good spirits. They're asking other people how they are. They're asking other people, 'Are you okay?'

         There are so many stories of people who've left their own homes to help put out fires on other people's properties. That's the spirit—not just the Queensland spirit but the spirit of good Australians, true Australians—that we're seeing right across these fire-affected regions. They are people such as Joan Lennox and Maz Wright from Eungella, west of Mackay. We could call them angels of mercy, because they are—ordinary, everyday people doing extraordinary deeds: helping to cook for the firefighters, going beyond exhaustion to continue to help out with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         and with other volunteers to make sure that people who have no home to go to have something to eat and something to wear, and being there for a chat when they need it. Sometimes it's these small gestures that can make the difference. Joan and Maz are inspiring, and there are so many efforts just like that. During an aerial inspection of the damage, I could see what a tremendous job the firefighters have done to save homes and property. Firefighters from Agnes Water showed me a home that was surrounded by smoke and charred trees, and somehow those heroes on the front line managed to save it from the flames. It was quite unbelievable. And I visited Mount Larcom State School, with the member for Flynn, which also narrowly escaped being razed, thanks to the magnificent efforts of our firefighters. School's in today—saved by a whisker. Those in our emergency services have put their lives at risk, as they always do, and worked tirelessly to save entire communities. I know that the people who live in those areas are just so appreciative and so grateful.

         Tragically, one young man,

          George Bird
         </a>
         —just 21, with his whole life ahead of him—lost his life while clearing a firebreak on his family's property at Rolleston. We mourn his loss. We grieve with his community. Whilst the fires still rage, and all through the summer, we need people to stay calm, to be measured, to heed the advice of local authorities. It's also very, very important to have a fire plan. It's so important. We pay tribute to the firefighters, paid and unpaid. They are inspiring people; they are great Australians. I urge Australians to keep these communities, these people and these volunteers in mind. To those affected: please be patient, stay calm, stay safe. Australians, we have your back.

          On indulgence: the opposition wishes to associate itself with the remarks of the government. There are 109 fires still burning, from Bundaberg to Gladstone, Mackay, Rockhampton and along

          and in many smaller locations. The loss of life is devastating. We, too, send our condolences to the family. And to the professionals and the volunteers: thank you, thank you, thank you.
