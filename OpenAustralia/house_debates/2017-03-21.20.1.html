        I rise today to speak about the South East Field Days held at Lucindale last weekend. The South East Field Days event is by far the largest event of its type in my electorate and it attracts approximately 22,000 people over two days. Thanks to Lyn Crosby, the secretary of the committee, and more broadly the Lucindale Lions Club for arranging such a fantastic event. Thanks also to the Lucindale Area School, who organised the Yakka trail and gave me an opportunity to give away over 1,000 gift bags over the days. Country field days promote the best of what local committees have to offer and provide an invaluable chance for regional families to exchange ideas and to socialise with others who share common interests.

        This Saturday, I am attending a different kind of event. I will be at Keith's Diesel and Dirt Derby. I have put my hand up to take part in Australia's only header demolition derby. Similar to monster truck demolition derbies, the header demolition event is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Competitors will now have the chance to smash their headers into a header driven by their federal member of parliament.

        Having a background in livestock farming, I have not mastered how to drive a combine harvester. If all goes to plan, I will still be around to attend the Karoonda Farm Fair the following weekend. Each of these shows, field days and farm fares across my electorate attract crowds and give me a chance to have a bit of fun. But, much more importantly, they give me an opportunity to hear the concerns that are emanating from rural Australia.
