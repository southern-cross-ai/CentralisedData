        celebrating 60 years in business.

        John wanted the book to record his adventures in life shared with wife Gloria.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More than 100 contributors participated in piecing together the life, family, business and leisure pursuits of John and Gloria and their children Craig, Melissa and Trish.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 60-year history began in 1962 when at midday on November 28, Jack finished his form four Asian history exam at Warragul High School. "Unable to withstand any more chalk and blackboard stuff, at the front concrete memorial gate posts, he shredded the textbook and went home for lunch," the book states.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The book quotes John: "that afternoon I rode my bike to a farm 10 kilometres from home and carted hay, earning one pound and eight shillings an hour. I got 15 out of 100 for that exam. I did not return to school. I was in business."

        This man was a loving grandfather, father, husband. It was such a sad death. We had a wake while he was alive, we had a funeral after his death and we had a burial last Saturday. Vale John Castle.
