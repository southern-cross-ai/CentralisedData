        The latest economic figures on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley
        </a>
        show some promising trends, and that is before the majority of the benefits of the over $7 billion upgrade of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        between Ballina and Woolgoolga fully kicks in. The latest research has found that in the last financial year the Clarence Valley's gross regional product was $2.6 billion. That represented an annual growth rate of 13.1 per cent in real terms. The number of people in work also grew by over seven per cent in the last September quarter, and the employment rate has now fallen to levels far below that in most areas in Sydney. On the home front, housing approvals jumped by nearly 60 per cent and non-residential approvals soared by nearly 500 per cent. Farmers are also telling me that prices are on the up for them in a whole variety of things; cattle, dairy, blueberries, sugar and macas are all getting higher prices than they once were.
       </p>
       <p>
        We as a government are also doing our bit to ensure this growth continues. Last December I announced a grant of $4.15 million to upgrade the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harwood_Mill" rel="nofollow">
         Harwood Mill
        </a>
        and Refinery under the Australian government's National Stronger Regions Fund. More than 2,000 jobs exist because of the Harwood millâ€”this obviously includes direct jobs at mill, as well as the growers, the carters, and a lot of associated jobs. This grant means not only that these jobs are more secure but also that the mill can now focus on growth to create more jobs. It is a massive investment in the future of the industry, which will directly benefit any employer associated with the mill, including all small businesses in the region. As mentioned already, we have also guaranteed federal funding of $5.6 billion to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway; that in itself creates 4,000 direct full-time jobs, and thousand more indirect jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very proud to represent the Clarence Valley and proud to be member of the Turnbull-Joyce government, which understands the importance of regional Australia and the significant role it plays in the national economy. We have more to do, but the direction we are going in is good and the Clarence Valley is growing well.
