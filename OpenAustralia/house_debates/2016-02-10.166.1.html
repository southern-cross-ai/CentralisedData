       <p>
        I make the strong case in the parliament for the extension of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Suburbs" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Suburbs
        </a>
        metropolitan railway 14 kilometres northwards from Butler to Yanchep. I fully support the efforts of my colleague the member for Pearce in advancing this cause together for the greater region which spans several electorates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cost of the railway extension, including a station and rolling stock, is estimated at $360 million. The Public Transport Authority of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        has already completed a business case which highlights both the importance and the value of extending the railway to Yanchep. The cost-benefit analysis clearly demonstrates that, on merit, the railway extension should be Western Australia's highest-priority major public transport project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Yanchep Beach Joint Venture is seeking guidance and assistance from the Commonwealth government to elevate the 14-kilometre rail extension to Yanchep onto the national infrastructure agenda. Since 2002, successive federal governments have also accredited the Yanchep development with Major Project Facilitation status. To demonstrate their strong financial commitment, Yanchep Beach Joint Venture is offering to enter into negotiations over a land contribution worth up to $100 million, to facilitate the railway extension with governments at all levels. Alignment of the railway track is already secured through a reservation in metropolitan regional scheme. My electorate of Moore is located in the suburban north-west corridor of Perth, with the city of Joondalup as its main regional centre. The greater area represents a primary metropolitan growth region, forecast to continue growing for many decades into the future. Therefore, efficient transport systems, especially public transport in the form of the extension of the Northern Suburbs Railway, are vital to the future development of the corridor as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perth is predominantly a linear city with the majority of commercial activity focused around the central business district. Traffic congestion in particular is getting worse as transport infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the growth in the suburban population of Perth. The solution is to adequately plan for the future growth of the area to the north of Joondalup. Located 53 kilometres north of the

        consist of in excess of 5,500 hectares of greenfield residential, commercial and industrial land which, when developed, will meet Perth's land supply needs for decades and will create over 50,000 local jobs. The
