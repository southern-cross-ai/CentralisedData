       <p>
        On Saturday I was deeply saddened by the news that Councillor Charlie Gregorini, the Mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         City of Swan
        </a>
        , had died in a tragic accident. It will be difficult to convey in a few words my respect for and admiration of Charlie, the man and the mayor. I know I share a sense of great loss with thousands of people who live and work in the City of Swan. Charlie Gregorini was a very special man—generous, warm-hearted and loving. He was proud of his family and treasured his time with them, especially Sandra, his wife of 38 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Charlie was passionate about his community and worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for all in the Swan region. He started his community work as a 16-year-old and dedicated the rest of his life to others. He was first elected to local government in 1977 and became the council’s longest serving president and mayor. His services to local government were recognised in 1988 when he was awarded the

        </a>
        and, again, earlier this year when he was made a

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Charlie was a great champion and advocate for the City of Swan, not just at the local and regional level but also at a state and national level. As the local federal member of parliament, I was proud to host Charlie, City of Swan

        . I was proud to count Charlie Gregorini as a friend. I send my love and deepest sympathy to Sandra and her family. We will all miss him.
