        Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's reports on the relisting of Boko Haram and Islamic State as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code and the declaration of Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation under the Citizenship Act. Under the Criminal Code, it is an offence to direct the activities of, be a member of, associate with, or conduct a range of activities in support of a listed terrorist organisation.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         The Criminal Code
        </a>
        enables the committee to review all listings of terrorist organisations and report its findings to the parliament within the 15-day disallowance period.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conducting its review, the committee held a private hearing with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        and the Attorney-General's Department and carefully reviewed the listings by reference both to the procedures followed by the government and to the merits of the listings themselves. The committee was satisfied that the appropriate processes had been followed and that Boko Haram and Islamic State—two of the most bloodthirsty and evil terrorist organisations operating in the world today—continue to meet the relevant thresholds to be listed as terrorist organisations. The committee therefore supports the relisting of both organisations and finds no reason to disallow the legislative instruments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The PJCIS has a similar review power under the Australian Citizenship Act, which provides for dual citizens aged over 14 years to lose their Australian citizenship if they engage in certain conduct on behalf of a declared terrorist organisation. The immigration minister's declaration of Jabhat al-Nusra in July 2017 was the second to have taken place under the provisions, the first being Islamic State in May 2016. As part of its review of the declaration, the committee held a private hearing with ASIO, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The committee was satisfied that Jabhat al-Nusra—which is already a listed terrorist organisation—is opposed to Australia and Australia's interests, values, democratic beliefs, rights and liberties. If a person were to fight for or be in the service of the organisation, the person would be acting inconsistently with their allegiance to Australia. The committee therefore supports the declaration and finds no reason to disallow the legislative instrument. I commend both reports to the House.
