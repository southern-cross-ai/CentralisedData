        My question is to the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister condemned the violent 'river to the sea' chant, Labor Senator Fatima Payman publicly rebuked him and repeated it. Yesterday, Senator Payman crossed the floor to support the Greens' hate-filled campaign to ferment social divisions on Palestine, apparently without consequences. Prime Minister Bob Hawke, when he was leader of the Labor Party, suspended two members for such actions. Every leader since him has stood up and shown strength of leadership. Will the Prime Minister do the same?

           </small>
           <p>
            I make this point: 'from the river to the sea' refers to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River" rel="nofollow">
             Jordan River
            </a>
            and the Mediterranean. The problem with 'from the river to the sea' being one state, whether just Israel or just Palestine, is that it denies the existence of the other peoples and denies the need for a two-state solution, which is why I have consistently opposed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have consistently supported two states—Palestine and Israel—living side by side in peace and security, and that is the Australian Labor Party's position, and I'm proud of it. I have consistently opposed the actions from day one of what occurred with the terrorist act on October 7. Hamas committed atrocities and need to be totally condemned. I have also expressed my grave concern at the humanitarian loss in Gaza, including our call for the ground invasion of Rafah to not occur. We warned of what the consequences of that would be. I regret the loss of all innocent life, whether it be Israeli or Palestinian. That is the principled position that I have taken. That is why I have—yesterday, the position that was put forward by Senator Wong in the Senate was a principled one: the need for the Senate to recognise the state of Palestine as a part of a peace process in support of a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's beyond me why the Greens political party or the Liberal Party or the National Party did not support that position. For the truth is that they did not. That is the appropriate position being put forward. I met with Senator Payman earlier today. She will not be attending the Labor caucus for the rest of this session.
