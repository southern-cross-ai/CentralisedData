        Ronald Best passed away on 14 August this year after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Ron was a National Party member of the Victorian legislative council from 1988 to 2002, and he represented

        . He was the secretary of the parliamentary National Party as well. Prior to his time in politics, Ron was a successful businessman, a motel owner, a hotel owner and also the owner of a frozen food company.

        He was well known and regarded as one of the best footballers never to play in the

        . As a country footballer he kicked 1,624 goals over 16 seasons, popping 100 goals a year on 13 occasions. The first time he did that was when he was an 18-year-old playing senior football at

        . He booted 10 goals on 48 different occasions. He was just an amazing player. He played in five premierships, including coaching Bendigo league to premierships and Sandhurst to its drought-breaking 1973 flag, when he was 23 years of age. He also had success with Golden Square and Northern United and with Boort in the

        I have amazing memories. Ron retired to enable me to run for the seat of Northern Victoria. I remember travelling around Northern Victoria with him, meeting all the people who make the community work. He was such an amazing man. He was so well respected. My thoughts go to Louise, Elizabeth, Chris and their families. I think everyone's going to miss Ron Best.
