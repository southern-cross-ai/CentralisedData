        Australia is overwhelmingly a peaceful and collegiate nation. For millennia, we have been a multicultural nation. Overwhelmingly positive for our country, multiculturalism has improved our communities in Australia, and I see this every day in Werriwa. So many diverse communities come together to raise money for those less fortunate, helping in times of disaster and supporting themselves and each other. But, in embracing multiculturalism, we need to be sensitive and attentive to the concerns of our citizens. There's no space now or ever to disrespect people because of their ethnicity, religious practices or what they believe in. Our diversity is our greatest strength, and we all prosper by embracing this. Our communities in south-west Sydney are a prime example of this action.

        Recently, I had the opportunity to host and more importantly recognise volunteers in Werriwa. This was the eighth occasion I've done this, and it showcases the very best of our community and our society. Each of the people recognised on the day have done wonderful things, not expecting recognition, often over many decades and in all areas of our lives. Often we assume these are paid roles, but they're notâ€”they're volunteers. Whether they're a

        So I say congratulations and thank you to the 2024 Werriwa volunteer awardees: Antoinette Sulfaro and Grace Newcombe from Ladies Like to Lunch; Amy Lee Eldridge from the

        from Whiddon Glenfield; Dianne Young and Mathew Hay from Meals on Wheels; and Gautham Rao, Srikumar Ravikumar, Prakash Koovekal and Jyothi Angadi from Sewa. Sewa organise support for flood victims in Lismore, and others have provided JP services in our community for over 50 years. Some have delivered meals for those who can't do it anymore or raised money to support cancer victims.

        I also had the privilege of attending the national volunteer Whiddon lunch to mark National Volunteer Week. It was wonderful to be at this aged-care facility and congratulate them on all they do to find interesting things for their residents. Thank you to everyone in our community who volunteers every day, and congratulations to those who've been recognised this year.
