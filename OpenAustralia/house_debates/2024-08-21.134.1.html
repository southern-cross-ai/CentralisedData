        Last Friday I attended the funeral of

         Sarah Carter

        . She was just 45 years old. I acknowledge the loss to her family and I acknowledge her mother, Gaynor, who's listening to this as we speak.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah was the first woman to be elected Mayor of Maribyrnong three times and only the second mayor in the municipality's history to achieve emeritus status, the highest recognition for distinguished service in local government leadership. She received multiple awards for her contribution to the council since being first elected in 2008 and she was serving her fourth consecutive term. She was simply the most decorated female councillor in a city that was established in 1859.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah was passionate about Maribyrnong and the local community. She lived a life of service, with her work grounded in grassroots community engagement. There was an energy, an enthusiasm, creative thinking and a fearlessness to Sarah which was unmatched.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah was also a tireless international advocate. Those gathered at the service heard of Sarah's remarkable efforts with the charity organisation Save the Children. Mat Tinkler,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the organisation, spoke beautifully of shared memories, and of offering Ms Carter the job of leading a program to visit aid and development programs overseas, which one friend described as her life's work. Mr Tinkler said that Sarah called it her 'dream job', but he said to her, 'I think you're the dream candidate.' She'll also be remembered for her fight to reinstate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVF" rel="nofollow">
         IVF
        </a>
        treatments during COVID lockdowns.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the weeks that have passed since we learned of Sarah's death she's been remembered as a force of natureâ€”in the words of her mother, an intelligent, vivacious, caring woman who set out singly to make a difference in many people's lives. She had the ability to make every individual feel like they were the most important person in the room. Her father, David, said that, despite the overwhelming loss of his daughter, he felt immense pride that her life had been marked by unwavering dedication and compassion and a fierce commitment to making the world a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's now the job of all of us who knew Sarah to make sure that her legacy lives on, and I acknowledge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        will have a memorial prize for their women members named after her. Victorian minister Natalie Hutchins spoke passionately. A long-time friend and mentor, she spoke at the funeral, remembering Sarah as a brilliant and captivating woman, and sorely missed. I think it's a fitting tribute to Sarah, who didn't just break but smashed the glass ceiling, that there will be an award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to thank so many federal MPs, including coalition MPs Michael McCormack,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Chester" rel="nofollow">
         Darren Chester
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Tehan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , along with Sharon Claydon, who flew interstate, and the Victorian federal MPs, for being there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Who knows what Sarah could've accomplished next? We all regret her passing. She was a passionate children's champion. She was a community leader who represented the best of Labor. She will be missed. Sarah Carter was the best of us.
