        Thank you, Deputy Speaker Gee, for stepping into the breach. Parliamentarians often refer to July as the winter break, but up in the north it's been non-stop action—the dry season is here. Here are just some of the highlights.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had a forum looking at the great opportunities that will follow on from the start of flights from Darwin to mainland China. The member for Hunter and the member for Blaxland came up and saw firsthand some of the exciting things happening in the north. Their visit included a trip out to the Humpty Doo Barramundi farm. In fact, the member for Blaxland visited twice over the winter break, including a visit out to the increasingly neglected

        . I understand my good friend Dr Freelander also made his way out to Kakadu during the break, which is fantastic.

        I had the opportunity to join the Australian American Leadership Dialogue, first at

        I held a crime and justice task force forum with the member for Hotham,

        —thank you. We listened to the community and to local service providers on some of the current challenges. We had many events out in the community. The Darwin Show was fantastic. I chaired a public hearing of the

We also had the member for Griffith up in Darwin, where we had a youth roundtable discussing mental health for young people and university funding. It is not helpful that $30 million is being ripped out of
