        () (): A proposed aged-care development in Lota has united my Bayside constituents like few other issues. I phone-canvassed the area and stopped by the local Manly markets recently and the No.1 issue for locals by far was the proposed Lota House development. Lota House is a significant two-storey Queensland Heritage building that was constructed in the late 1800s. It's surrounded by heritage listed woodland. Now there's a development application in place to build three, and eventually seven, seven-storey high-rise retirement facilities on this heritage site. A development of this height and size is simply incompatible with existing development in Lota. It will present a traffic nightmare for surrounding residents and there are also adverse historical and environmental impacts on the area to consider. Every local I've spoken to about the proposal has raised these objections with me. Now they've started the Bayside Action Group to come out in force against it. It was great to meet with them last week at the site and see people power in action. It's a testament to people power that the lord mayor has said that the

        is very concerned about the proposal. I've written to the Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning, the Honourable Cameron Dick, on this matter. I've asked the minister to reject the current development application and asked him to ask the applicants to reconsider the development.
