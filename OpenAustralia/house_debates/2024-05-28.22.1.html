       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to one of my distinguished constituents, Mr Colin Heard, and congratulate him on his 100th birthday. Originally from the south, Colin was selected by the

        . He flew with the 78 Squadron in 1943 and 1944 during its operations in

        . Colin survived the loss of his aircraft when his aircraft engine caught fire after a strafing run. It took only 10 seconds to sink. Fortunately, he got off and jumped into the ocean and was picked up by a

        patrol boat. Colin has a magnificent war service record. It shows that he was involved in 23 daytime operational sorties involving strikes and attacks and 61 other operations which were mostly fighter-escort operations. Colin's postwar life was very successful as well in terms of both his family and his businesses.

        Colin, you are a remarkable Territorian. This whole parliament is incredibly proud of your service. I hope you have a wonderful birthday.
