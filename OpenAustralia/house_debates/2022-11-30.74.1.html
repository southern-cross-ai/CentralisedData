        My question is for the Prime Minister. Journalists obtaining and publishing sensitive information in the public interest is essential to democracy. Australian citizen
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
         Julian Assange
        </a>
        is still contained in Belmarsh prison, charged by a foreign government with acts of journalism. Mr Assange's freedom will only come from political intervention. Will the government intervene to bring Mr Assange home?

         I thank the member for Kooyong for her question. She raises an issue that is of great interest to many Australians and of interest to people, it must be said, as well across this chamber. I particularly note the member for Bruce, the member New England, for example, people who have raised this question.
        </p>
        <p>
         I, sometime ago, made my point that enough is enough. It is time for this matter to be brought to a conclusion. In that, I don't express any personal sympathy with some of the actions of Mr Assange. I do say though that this issue has gone on for many years now, and when you look at the issue of Mr Assange and compare that with the person responsible for leaking the information,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning" rel="nofollow">
          Bradley Manning
         </a>
         , now Chelsea Manning, she is now able to participate freely in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         society.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will continue to act in a diplomatic way, but can I assure the member for Kooyong that I have raised this personally with representatives of the United States government. My position is clear and has been made clear to the US administration that it is time that this matter be brought to a close. This is an Australian citizen. As I said, I don't have sympathy for Mr Assange's actions, on a whole range of matters. But, having said that, you have to reach a point whereby what is the point of this continuing, this legal action, which could be caught up now for many years into the future? So I will continue to advocate, as I did recently in meetings that I have held. I thank the member for her question and for her genuine interest in this, along with so many Australian citizens who have contacted me about this issue.
