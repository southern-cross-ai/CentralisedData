        The

         Greek Cypriot
        </a>
        community has made an enormous contribution to Australia as a migrant community, in particular to the northern suburbs of Melbourne. I was thrilled to be able to greet a high profile delegation from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Cyprus" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Cyprus
        </a>
        , led by Demetris Syllouris, the President of the republic's house of assembly, to Epping, in particular to show them a wonderful aged-care facility, Grace of Mary. It was a really significant event for the local Greek Cypriot community in Melbourne and showed the importance of the ongoing ties. I was pleased later, when the parliament recently sat, to welcome the delegation here in parliament and to start working through how we can build on the great people-to-people links we enjoy to a stronger relationship between our countries. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge that in this place and put on the record my deep appreciation of Mr Syllouris for his deep engagement with the diaspora community here. I know how much it means to them.

        I am also very pleased to have welcomed to the parliament today a group of students from a wonderful school, Al Siraat College, an Islamic college in my electorate. This school is relatively new, but it is doing great things and has really built a strong community around it. It was a real privilege to engage with some young students today to share with them my privilege in working in this place and to try to answer their probing questions about what we do and how we might do it better. I am very pleased to give a shout-out to those wonderful students, who I hope we'll see back here soon.
