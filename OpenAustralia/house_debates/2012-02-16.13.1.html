        I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. I ask leave of the House to move government amendments (1) and (2) together.

       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments replace schedule 1, item 95, lines 19 and 20 of the bill. The amendments provide that a director or an inspector of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate is prohibited from commencing or continuing civil proceedings in a court where proceedings arise under a designated building law and involve the building industry participant and the matter of the subject of the proceedings is subsequently settled and discontinued by the parties other than the inspectorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the work of the Greens in proposing amendments to the bill and, in particular, their proposed amendment seeking to limit further proceedings when matters have settled. The government amendments will ensure that all building industry participants are not subject to multiple proceedings in relation to matters that have already been the subject of discontinued litigation as well as ensure the resources of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate are more appropriately targeted to matters which remain unresolved.

           <p>
            As many of us know, the rot really set in under the former Howard government. Under that government it became normal to treat certain groups of citizens differently, to treat certain groups as having different and lesser rights to others. We saw it in the sphere of immigration; we saw it with the terrorism laws that were rushed through and that removed the very old right to silence; we saw it with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
             Work Choices
            </a>
            , where the minister was able to step in and take away people's right to bargain without even a hearing—a provision that, to its shame, the Labor government has retained; and, of course, we also saw it in the separate set of regulations and legislation for workers in the building and construction industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a basic principle that should continue to apply: there should be one set of laws in this country that apply uniformly to all citizens. You should not have fewer rights in this country just because you turn up to work in a hard hat and boots than if you turn up in a suit and tie. I am a firm believer in the principle that you do not make things better and solve problems by taking away people's rights. It is a pernicious attitude that unfortunately pervades through both sides of this chamber far too often.
           </p>
           <p>
            If industrial policemen could walk into an office or if industrial policemen could walk into a shop in this country and take a worker out and require them to go to a secret hearing where they would be forced to name names, there would be an outcry. Yet it seems that this is acceptable in the building industry. We have a unique chance to undo the damage that was done by the Howard government. It may be the only chance that comes around for a long time. We now have enough support on the crossbenches to repeal this legislation once and for all. That is what my amendments will do. If these amendments are not supported, members of this House would be well advised to remember one thing: the person in a hard hat and fluoro vest that they stand next to for a photo opportunity during an election campaign one day could be hauled off for questioning the next.
           </p>
           <p>
            If these coercive powers and this legislation remain and if we continue with two tiers of industrial regulation in this country, where you may have fewer rights because you work in the building industry, it will be purely and simply because Labor wants it to remain that way. I commend the amendments to the House.

            The SPEAKER: I thank the honourable member for Melbourne. I call the honourable member for Kennedy and then I will call the honourable the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.

            <p>
             In ancient history there may have been some very serious problems in the area of building and construction. There is a saying in the law that hard cases make bad law. That most certainly would be the case with this legislation. I feel very uncomfortable about the fact that discriminatory laws mean that one group of people is treated entirely differently from others. Those of us with dirt under our fingernails and calluses on our hands—there are very few such people in this place—know that at workplaces there are extremely dangerous situations. As a worker you accept that. We had very high pay at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Isa" rel="nofollow">
              Mt Isa
             </a>
             but we had to work in extremely dangerous situations. Where there is weak industrial representation lives can put in serious jeopardy. I do not want to take up the time of the House explaining actual cases at Mt Isa, but I know of such cases recently and a long time ago. Building, particularly high-rise construction and tunnelling construction, is equally as dangerous as mining. That is why workers in those industries get a higher pay and why they most certainly deserve a higher pay.
            </p>
            <p>
             I heard of a series of accidents during the construction of a tunnel in Brisbane. I was put upon to go to a big stop-work rally at the tunnel. I have said this in the House before, but I think it bears saying again: I knew that because of an accident there was a person whose life was hanging in the balance. That occurred after a series of confrontations about safety at the workplace. There had been a series of bad accidents and the workers were saying it was unsafe. Then there was a very serious accident where a person's life was in jeopardy. I went to the stop-work meeting on the principle that the situation was wrong and that laws had to be changed. You cannot intimidate trade union officials in this industry, where there is a risk of accidents, because if you do it there can be terrible outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not know whether trade union officials were intimidated, kept away or confronted. I do know that there was a series of confrontations over safety and that a young man was seriously injured. I went there on principle. When I got there I found out that the young man was the brother of one of my very good friends, who will be running for, and will probably become, mayor of one of the towns in my electorate. I had acted on a principle, and I found out that the principal person concerned was someone who I knew. That person subsequently died. I do not know that we have improved the situation there, but I do not want to be inhibiting our protectors any longer. There are a set of laws that apply to everyone in Australia and that set apply to those protectors. If they get a bit carried away with their job as protector and start a
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Earp" rel="nofollow">
              Wyatt Earp
             </a>
             game, then there are laws in place to restrain that sort of behaviour. But the existing laws that remove the most fundamental rights and freedoms are excessive. The right to remain silent is respected in every single jurisdiction in the world. The only exception to it is here. I have very great pleasure in backing my colleague's proposal.

               <p>
                I will not go into the details of these amendments, because I think most people have made up their minds about which way they are going here. The amendments cut to the coercive powers. There are certain pillars upon which our society is built—habeas corpus, the fact that land cannot be taken from us, section 39 of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta" rel="nofollow">
                 Magna Carta
                </a>
                . A more modern one is the right to silence. It is accepted in every single jurisdiction in the world that I know of. You cannot have it tortured out of you; we are not the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition" rel="nofollow">
                 Spanish Inquisition
                </a>
                . And that is really what the coercive powers are about: we can grab you, hold you, put you in incarceration and you will talk—and if you do not talk you are breaching the law and we are going to keep you there indefinitely.
               </p>
               <p>
                Does any fair-minded person really believe that that is what should be happening here? The history of this is that there was excessive behaviour at one stage, going back to the days of the painters and dockers. But we have to go back 50 years now in order to quote those sorts of incidents. There may have been some excessive behaviour that sparked this legislation. But it was bad legislation at the start. It was excessive legislation. I go back to that famous legal phrase that hard cases make bad law.
               </p>
               <p>
                We are continuing on with the bad law, all due respect to the government, because this is a cunning little two-step. It was the people on my right who decided we would deregulate the labour market. Ask the farmers about deregulation. Ask them how they fared under deregulation. When the dairy farmers were deregulated and faced these sorts of oppressive powers—

                    Coercive powers are used. We do not live in a jungle. We live in a civilised society, and we must attempt at all times to assert the principle of a civilised society where we do not have coercive powers. Why is it that in no other area of the law do we have coercive powers?

                    In this case we are talking about safety. We are talking about riggers working on steel skeletons 40 storeys above the ground. We are talking about people going down mines, where, if a cable is not properly tied down, the entire roof will collapse. For those who think that does not happen, I was in a taxi in

                    </a>
                    and I asked the driver, 'Why did you leave a job at $200,000 a year as a miner?' He said, 'Because I was asked to do the tie-down cables.' I said, 'But you don't know anything about tie-down cables,' and he said, 'Too bloody right I don't. I told the young engineer, "No way in the world," and he said: "Well, you're the only one who's got any experience here. No way in the world will I touch it." ' Because he did not want to appear to be stupid, this young engineer went off and attached the cables himself. Twelve minutes after crib time the entire roof of the crib came down, and it would have killed 16 people.

                     <p>
                      What we are proposing here is the removal of those coercive powers now instead of having, in three years time—as the government well knows—this other mob over here coming in. They cannot even spell 'workers' rights'; it means something different to them. To the government I say: fair go; we know what you are up to here. You have appeased all your corporate bonus sponsors and friends. You have made them happy, because it was never really going to happen, because the other mob will get in and of course will never remove the coercive powers.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So that is the reason we are moving these amendments today. This is not excessive legislation that we have proposed. It is simply getting in step with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world. As the great Alfred the Great said, 'I want it to be said of we English that we are a civilised people.'

                       I am speaking against the amendments. Whilst I understand the passion in the remarks of the member for Kennedy, the government does not support them. In particular, we do not support the remarks about appeasing corporate donors—although I did find some sympathy for the member's analysis of the coalition. The government's bill reflects the recommendations of the Wilcox—

                         If the hat fits, member for Mayo. In our bill we are reflecting our election commitments. I also acknowledge the concerns raised during the debate by many members about coercive powers. In accordance with the Wilcox recommendations, the bill retains coercive powers but with important and significant safeguards. These include the requirement that a presidential member of the

                         be satisfied a case has been made for the use of coercive powers on each occasion they are to be used; the right for individuals to be represented by a lawyer of their choice; recognition of the right to refuse to disclose information on the grounds of either legal professional privilege or public interest immunity; reimbursement of reasonable expenses, including reasonable legal expenses, for people summonsed for examination; the requirement that all examinations be undertaken by the director or an

                         </a>
                         officer; the requirement that all examinations be videotaped; and the requirement that the Commonwealth Ombudsman, informed by the videotapes, monitor and review all examinations and provide reports to the parliament on the exercise of this power.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In addition to these and other safeguards, this bill reflects the government's priority in focusing compliance activities where those activities are most needed. Consequently, the coercive powers are subject to a three-year sunset clause in the bill. Prior to the sunset, a review of all matters relating to compliance in the building and construction industry will occur. Any such review would of course be inclusive of all stakeholders.

                          I support the amendments moved by the member for Kennedy. If these amendments do not get up, building workers in this country will have fewer rights than accused criminals. Building workers will be able to be hauled in for investigation, forced to answer questions and forced to name names. I hear the minister point to some of the other amendments, including that building workers will have their expenses reimbursed. I tell you what: I reckon someone would rather have the right to silence than have their taxi fare paid—for a taxi ride to ferry them into a star chamber where they can be forced, in true

                         <p>
                          When this legislation was introduced, Labor were right there standing for the principles of the rule of law, knowing that we should not have a situation where building workers had fewer rights than accused criminals. We now have the opportunity to restore the rule of law, to restore that fundamental principle of the right to silence and to address the situation where building workers have fewer rights than accused criminals. So I heartily support these amendments.

                            —of which we are members and of which we have ratified the conventions—has said, on no less than eight separate occasions, contravene international law.

                            When these findings were handed down under the former Howard government there was a massive hue and cry from sections of those who believe in the rule of law, from the trade union movement and from the Labor Party. These provisions are exactly the same, have the same effect and remove the same rights as under the former government. I am disappointed that the last set of amendments moved by the member for Kennedy was not successful and so I move a compromise, which is that we retain these coercive powers only for the most serious of offences.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I move that we keep them only for those offences against a designated building law, punishable by imprisonment for a period of 12 months or more. If this amendment is not supported it is the equivalent of saying that coercive powers should apply for the industrial equivalent of a parking fine. It should not be the case that any simple, merely alleged breach of the law removes your right to silence and allows you to be hauled in for questioning. It should only be, at an absolute minimum, saved for those most serious of offences. I am hopeful that this compromise amendment will even get the government's support.

                             I am sorry to disappoint the member for Melbourne. We do not support this amendment. We believe that we have put in important and significant safeguards for the use of coercive powers. We have acted in accordance with the Wilcox recommendations.

                               These amendments do different things, but they are very important. One thing they do is to implement the government's election platform: that is, they say that this new entity—which is obviously now well on its way to being set up to be a special secret police in the building industry—should not be the kind of autonomous juggernaut that was established by the former government, the kind of juggernaut that gave the lie to the idea that this is about preserving the rule of law because, when you look at who it turned its attention to, the statistics speak for themselves.

                               commenced 86 prosecutions against workers, their representatives and their officials, and five against employers. The situation did not get any better with the change of government because, in the financial year 2009-10, there were 29 proceedings commenced against workers, their representatives and officials, and none against employers.

                               That is why it is so critical that these amendments do what the government had actually proposed in seeking election—that is to say that this new entity will not be a stand-alone, autonomous institution that is able to continue a process of litigating against a particular sector of the community and a particular side of that sector but, instead, will come under the Fair Work Ombudsman as an administrative division of the Fair Work Ombudsman.

                               The amendments do a number of other things. I will not go through them all, but I will draw the House's attention to a redirection of the new inspectorate's activities to some of the real problems in the industry. These amendments would require the new inspectorate to deal with the very real problem of sham contracting, and that is where—and we know it happens, and even the current Australian Building and Construction Commissioner tells us that it happens, and it defrauds the Commonwealth's purse of revenue—someone turns up to work and the employer says, 'We'll give you a job, provided that you incorporate yourself or come back with an

                               , and you won't get sick leave, you won't get superannuation and you'll be responsible for taking out your own WorkCover insurance.' This practice is rife. These amendments will tighten up the definition of sham contracting and require the inspector to pay attention to it.

                               The amendments will also require the inspector to pay attention to another critical issue: the exploitation of overseas labour in this industry. We have no problem with people coming from other countries and working here, but they should be entitled to the same wages and conditions as local workers. We know that this does not happen in the construction industry. We have routinely seen instances over the last couple of years—and it has usually been the union that has exposed it, not a government inspectorate because they are too busy prosecuting the unions—of people being drastically underpaid. It is about time that we redirected the government inspectorate's attention to this serious problem, and that is what these amendments will do. I commend the amendments to the House.

                                I listened carefully to the contribution of the member for Melbourne but I have to advise that the government will not be supporting his amendments. The government's position on the

                                 ABCC

                                has been clear for a very long time. We have committed to the Australian people that we will replace the ABCC with a new body to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry—a body that is part of our fair work system but which is a specialist body. We have committed to a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all building industry participants, a strong set of compliance arrangements and penalties for conduct in contravention of workplace law. We committed to a review of building industry regulation and we committed to introduce safeguards for the use of coercive examination powers to achieve the balance required to ensure compliance with the law and the fair treatment of individuals. This bill honours our government's commitments.

                               <p>
                                I do acknowledge the work of the Greens in proposing this set of amendments to the bill and in particular their proposed amendment seeking to limit further proceedings when matters have settled. The government understand the policy intent of the Greens amendments in limiting the exposure of the building industry participants to multiple and ongoing proceedings. But, as the House has seen in the last half hour, the government have its own amendments which limit the capacity for the new Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate to commence or continue litigation, but only where the litigation on the same subject matter has been discontinued because the building industry parties have settled their difference. We want to ensure that all building industry participants are not the subject of multiple proceedings in relation to matters that have already been the subject of discontinued litigation, as well as ensuring the resources of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate are appropriately targeted to matters which remain unresolved.

While I do understand that we have a number of divisions, and I probably should not be too strict on this, I would ask honourable members to note this for the future.
