       <p>
        On Saturday I was very privileged to start the 54th annual across the lake swim at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        . For those members of the House who do not know Lake Macquarie, it is the biggest lake in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        . For 54 years swimmers have been swimming across the lake. I was privileged to be there with Cliffy March
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who actually swam in the first across Lake Macquarie swim. It was an outstanding event on a perfect Lake Macquarie day. The weather was very good and the water was very smooth. I congratulate the winner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Collins" rel="nofollow">

        . He came first this year after coming second last year. He improved his time by two minutes and it was an outstanding swim, with him finishing the 3.8 kilometre swim from

        to Belmont in 43 minutes and 25 seconds. His sister, Jessica, was the first woman to finish. She won the female division and finished fifth overall. There was another division of a kilometre, which was won by Ryan Walker, a young person from Coal Point. I congratulate all the winners.
