        I say thank you not only to these incredible Australians but also to all the unsung heroes and selfless volunteers in Wide Bay who work to support community, service, veterans, church, educational, sporting and recreational groups. You make a real and positive difference to the lives of individuals, organisations and animals in need. You are the glue that holds our community together, and without you and all the wonderful work you do Wide Bay and our nation would just not be the same. Thank you, again.
