       <p>
        Cyclone Winston was one of the most severe cyclones to ever hit Fiji and was one of the worst storms to ever make landfall in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        . Over the last few weeks, as the level of devastation across the country has become apparent, emergency response teams from Australia and elsewhere have been traveling to Fiji to assist with the widespread damage and heavy losses. I am proud to say and to congratulate the government on the fact that Australia is working hard to help with the disaster relief efforts through the provision of $5 million in aid. With disaster relief efforts underway, I want to recognise the emergency response crews, volunteers and non-government organisation workers who are on the ground in Fiji. These people are a vital and valuable part of the relief effort, and I know a lot of people want to personally thank them for their service, commitment and care.

        I also am proud to represent an area with a large

        and Fijian community. I know how important it is to the local Australian-Fijian community that their families who were terribly affected by Cyclone Winston get the assistance they need to recover from this natural disaster. I was also especially pleased to participate in a Taste of Harmony morning tea, convened by the member for Greenway in conjunction with Senator Claire Moore, designed to raise proceeds for Save the Children. In the electorate of Chifley, the local Hindu cultural and welfare association is holding a community fundraiser. I urge everyone to support them in these efforts.
