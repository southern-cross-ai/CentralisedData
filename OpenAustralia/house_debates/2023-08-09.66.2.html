        My question is for the Prime Minister. How will the National Reconstruction Fund build stronger foundations for the future of Australian manufacturing and what obstacles has the government had to overcome in establishing the fund?

         I thank the member for Hunter for his question. I thank him also for hosting us in Muswellbrook, which holds an example there at the centre for innovation, right in the centre of town, of exactly what the opportunities are for new jobs and new industries in the Hunter. Building on of the success that the Hunter has had as a region driving our economy, it can continue to drive our economy into the future. The National Reconstruction Fund is about seizing the opportunities that are there.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the global pandemic, we were reminded of the problems that can arise with global supply chains and the need for us to be more self-reliant and more resilient. The need for us to make more things here, the need for us to have a manufacturing industry here, and the need for us to have a future made in Australia, right here is absolutely critical. There's a need for Australia workers, using Australian knowhow, innovation and smarts, and Australian resources to make more products here in Australia.

           The independent board that has been announced today is an outstanding team. I thank the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and the Minister for Finance for the work that they have done to come up with such an outstanding team. It is chaired by Martijn Wilder, who has decades of experience in sustainable finance. He is one of the founding directors of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which has been so successful, was the chair of the board of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
            ARENA

           , the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and is someone with an incredible background. I acknowledge the other people from industry and, indeed, Kelly O' Dwyer, with the experience she has in this chamber as a former Assistant Treasurer as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           We on this side of the House understand the need to maximise the capacities and input of all of our Australians. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRF" rel="nofollow">
            NRF
           </a>
           will revitalise manufacturing and create secure jobs in areas like critical minerals, seizing the opportunities of renewable energy, defence capability, value-adding in resources and value-adding in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, transport and medical scienceâ€”all of these things being positive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, those opposite interject. They oppose this because they say no to everything. They're addicted to just saying no: no to secure jobs, no to Australian manufacturing, no to new industries, and no to a future made right here in Australia.
