       <p>
        I want to put on the public record the thanks of the schools in the electorate of Corangamite for $2.8 million that the Howard government has provided to look after the state schools in Corangamite. Thirty-six schools across Corangamite have received this funding under the third round of the Investing in Our Schools program. The Howard government is committed, as you all know, to higher standards and an improvement in values in our schools. The particular point about this program is that the parents and the school principals have worked on the submissions. I personally have been pleased to make the announcements at some of the local schools throughout the length and breadth of Corangamite. The schools that have received the funding include Alvie Consolidated School; Colac College; Colac High School;

        ; Mount Duneed Regional Primary School; Rokewood Primary School, which I visited; Shelford Primary School; and Torquay Primary School. A number of other smaller schools have also enjoyed these extra grants, which have provided much-needed facilities such as computers, outdoor equipment and some of the smaller items that the state government might not have provided. These schools, their principals and the parents are delighted with these allocations of grants. I commend the government on this very important initiative.
