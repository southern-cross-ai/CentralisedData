       <p>
        The titles for books about the dysfunction and chaos of this government are already being written. Will they be called
        <i>
         Dysfunctional
        </i>
        ? Will they be called
        <i>
         Chaotic
        </i>
        ? Because the one thing this government cannot decide is its agenda from one day to the next. I was all ready to debate the registered orgs bill again. I have to say I am getting pretty good at that bill because it has been before the House a few times. In fact, yesterday, when we walked over to the other place for the joint sitting, it was even in the Governor-General's address—the registered orgs regulations. Yet today we see that legislation is gone. Yesterday it was on the agenda; today it is gone.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is with this government? They cannot even make up their mind from one day to the next. As was said on
        <i>
         Lateline
        </i>
        the other week, between lunchtime and
        <i>
         Lateline
        </i>
        this government changes its agenda, whether it be on workplace relations, the economy, tax policy or education—name an issue. All this government cares about is the theatre of politics. They are not interested in governing. They are not interested in standing up for working people. They are not interested in supporting Australian families. They are interested in the theatre of government, the theatre of politics, and that is all today is: 90-second statements, question time and a matter of public importance. This government is only interested in the theatre of politics, not government.
