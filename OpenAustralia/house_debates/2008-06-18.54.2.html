        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement in this House yesterday that the main reasons for the historic collapse in small business confidence in federal government policies were interest rates and inflation. Prime Minister, according to the Sensis business index report, the key reason for this collapse in confidence was that the government’s policies worked against small business. Prime Minister, are you aware of the injury your government’s policies are causing to small business and their employees?

         Small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy. Therefore, it is important, as small businesses are key members and participators in the economy, that this government implements a policy of responsible economic management. The core elements of responsible economic management are to ensure that we put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. If you fail to do that, what happens is the reverse—interest rates go up, it affects economic activity and growth and then it affects employment. That is why this government, since the beginning of this year, has embarked upon a clear-cut strategy to fight the fight against inflation. We will continue that fight, even in the absence of support from those opposite. If we fail to do that effectively, the roll-on consequences of further interest rate rises for small business in particular would be very bad indeed. That is why the government has a clear-cut policy on a $22 billion surplus. That is why those opposite are conducting, by reverse strategy, a $22 billion raid on the surplus. The second important contribution which we can make in terms of the impact of small businesses out there earning a living and working hard for their families and for the Australian economy is the work that I referred to yesterday by the Minister for

          I take the interjection, which said that dealing with deregulation is in fact motherhood. I do not think it is motherhood. Dealing with deregulation affects the ability of businesses to conduct their daily business. They say it is motherhood to come up with a proposal which says: ‘Why can’t we just have a single registration of a business name system in Australia rather than six or eight of them? Why can’t we have a system in this country where we move towards a seamless national economy and a seamless national market so that small businesses can grow into medium businesses and can actually expand their operations to different jurisdictions across the country?’ That is why we are engaged—

              is this: if you speak to small businesses across the country about the impact of the compliance burden of

               Work Choices
              </a>
              on small business, in particular their five-minutes-to-midnight invention of a fairness test and the impact which that had right across the economy in overall business compliance costs, all of these things add together when it comes to your ability to run a small business successfully. So let us aggregate the scorecard. We come into government with inflation running at 16-year highs. We come into government with 10 interest rate rises in a row. We come into government with them having promised that interest rates would be kept at—

                I don’t think it was kept at record lows. After 12 years in office there was a failure to act on the overall cry of business for some form of regulatory reform which enables them to get on with the job of running their businesses successfully. Then, as the ultimate icing on the cake, an industrial relations system was imposed in the last period of that government which became more complicated than that of the

                as a result of the impossible burden which it placed on business and their ability to get simple answers from the regulatory authorities as to whether they were in, out, on top of or underneath the multiple requirements—
