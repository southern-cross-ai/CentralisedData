       <p>
        Today I would like to acknowledge a community initiative that is helping migrants to feel welcome and is raising cultural awareness in my electorate of Bass. The Community Kitchen project is a collaborative project between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_Resource_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Migrant Resource Centre
        </a>
        Northern Tasmania and the Inveresk Tavern, where different migrant groups take on the cooking duties at the Tavern each Sunday afternoon.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project has been a big hit in Launceston and has received national media coverage, with excellent attendance and dishes often selling out before closing time. The Community Kitchen gives our migrant groups a chance to build skills and experience as well as raising funds for their communities. That is not to mention the social connections and capacity building that participants are enjoying.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 200 people are settled in Launceston each year, with 13 migrant groups now resident in the city, eight of whom are involved in the Community Kitchenâ€”including groups representing Bhutan, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Sudan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Eritrea and the Congo. It is fantastic to see local residents engaging with local migrant communities through the universal language of food.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the Migrant Resource Centre and the Inveresk Tavern on this fantastic initiative and thank each of the migrant groups involved for sharing a part of their culture with the Launceston community. Particularly having regard to the attack on multiculturalism, which should see this week an introduction of the new citizenship legislation, I commend to this House the initiatives that are taking place in local communities to enhance our multicultural future.
