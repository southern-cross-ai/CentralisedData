        Businesses in our region are never shy to showcase themselves or have a well-deserved event to celebrate. The 2018 Shoalhaven Business Awards winners were absolutely no exception. In fact, it has become quite a tradition, and this year we saw many new names added to the list of outstanding excellence. Due to family reasons I was not able to attend. However, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate each one of the winners.

        was won by Nowchem. This company is quite exemplary in all that it does: sponsoring trainees, apprentices, youth activities, youth leadership enterprise, participating in local CBD events, attending a raft of business forums and employment forums, and the list just goes on. Frankly, if every business were in a position to echo this, the whole of Gilmore would be up in lights for excellence in achievement.

        Congratulations to all these local businesses who have demonstrated excellence in their unique and wonderful ways. Not only that, they are all helping to reduce the unemployment levels in Gilmore. We've dropped from almost 30 per cent youth unemployment, when I was first elected in 2013, and we are now down to just over 14 per cent. I have to thank all of the organisations and all of the businesses in Gilmore who have been part of this game changer by employing youth in my region.
