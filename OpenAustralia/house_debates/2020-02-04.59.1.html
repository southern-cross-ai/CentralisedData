        <p>
         The answer to the honourable member's question is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2. No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Home Affairs
         </a>
         provides funding support to the Papua New Guinea Government for its operation of the Bomana Immigration Centre. The Department does not hold any contracts in relation to the operation of the Bomana Immigration Centre.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         4. At the request of the Papua New Guinea Government, the Department of Home Affairs provided training to six Papua New Guinea Immigration and Citizenship Authority officers working at the Bomana Immigration Centre.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Papua New Guinea Immigration and Citizenship Authority also engaged local service providers to deliver other relevant training directly to staff working at the Bomana Immigration Centre at cost of $12,952.25. The training included first aid, fire equipment training and

         defibrillator training.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         5. The arrangement between the Australia and Papua New Guinea Governments was agreed in confidence. If released, it could undermine Papua New Guinea's confidence in its good working relationship with Australia and may jeopardise cooperation on people smuggling matters more broadly.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         6. (a) Yes. The cost to construct the centre was approximately $23.2 million.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) As noted in 3) contracts are held by the Papua New Guinea Government.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         7. Access to the Bomana Immigration Centre is a matter for the Papua New Guinea Government.
