        I was pleased to join the official opening of the Erina Community Men's Shed Armistice Day Centenary Garden last Friday. It was a beautiful autumn day and a good crowd turned out to see the garden, designed around the artwork of

        . The National Service ReEnactment Unit was there to add the ceremony required for this important occasion, and secretary

        Last time I visited the Erina Community Men's Shed they presented me with my own tool belt, which was a great honour. In return, I hunted through my dad's shed and found some bits and pieces to donate to the men's shed. These things might not have been worth much, but, as a daughter, it meant a lot to me to give them to the shed. Grahame Bonnette put them all in their rightful place. My dad would have loved the shed: the craftsmanship, the mateship, men working shoulder to shoulder and the yarns that they enjoy.

        I want to commend the Erina Community Men's Shed for what they contribute to our community. It is growing on the coast. It shows the particular resilience of the Erina Community Men's Shed to push on with their Armistice Day Centenary Garden official opening despite a break-in only the week before, in which all of their welding equipment was stolen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as the shed rallies around local men, our local community rallied around the shed. Congratulations to Erina Community Men's Shed for all that it does for everyone in our community.
