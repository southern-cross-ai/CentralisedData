       <p>
        It is an honour for me to speak today about a man from my electorate who worked tirelessly to support thousands of students and teachers throughout his career. The name Gary Walden is well known and respected across the Macarthur region. He was a highly regarded teacher who worked for more than 30 years in schools across western and south-west Sydney. Gary was an inspiring man who was renowned for his dedication to inclusive education for all students, particularly those with special needs and their families. He was well known for his volunteer work and was a strong advocate of community based initiatives to help his students.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a huge loss to our community when Gary died suddenly in February 2007, eight days after having routine knee surgery. It was a terrible shock to us all and a great loss to his family, friends and school communities across the region. I attended Gary's funeral, with more than 900 others, to pay tribute to this fine man and to offer my support to his wife, Carol, and two sons, Matthew and Bradley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary was only 59 when he died. He had achieved so much in the field of education through his roles as a primary school principal, relieving district superintendent and School Education Director of South Western Sydney for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        . After he died, Gary's wife, Carol, who is also a teacher, received so many letters from students, parents and grandparents of his former students and teachers who Gary mentored over the years. She said that it was lovely to know he had touched the lives of so many people during his great career.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a tribute to Gary and his dream for inclusive education for all children, the Gary Walden Trust was established shortly after his death as a not-for-profit community based non-government organisation. The trust was launched in Campbelltown on 22 May 2007 and now disburses funds annually to individuals or groups who support students with special needs. It also provides additional support for teachers and parents of these students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since its inception in 2007, the Gary Walden Trust has granted more than $61,000 to 70 projects in schools across south-west Sydney. I am proud to say that the Macarthur community has continued to support the trust since its inception with an annual golf day and dinner. On 31 August 250 people attended this year's dinner, which raised more than $20,000 for the trust. The trust was set up to fund initiatives that would not normally fit regular funding and to give children with special needs a range of different learning experiences.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to his colleagues, this was Gary's way. If a family or child had needs Gary would always make sure something was done to help them, even when there were no traditional means of supporting that child or family. Local schools in Macarthur such as

        school, Mary Brooksbank school, Ambarvale Public School,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Vale" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Ingleburn high schools and many others across the region have benefited from the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The beneficiaries have used the funds to give children experiences they would not usually haveâ€”such as learning how to sail at Penrith Lakes, going on camps at Teen Ranch and a horse-riding program. Local residents, businesses and families donate prizes for the annual dinner, which is also well supported by Gary's family, including Carol, Matthew and Brad, Gary's brother Ross and his sister-in-law Helen. I know they are all very proud of Gary's achievements and the legacy he has left for the children of Macarthur.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is a great tribute to Gary that so many people support this trust each year to carry on his dream for children with special needs in my electorate. Gary Walden was like many teachers in Macarthur who work above and beyond their expected duties to help their students achieve their full potential. Gary was also well known for his ability to mentor young people and new teachers. He helped many young teachers build up their leadership responsibilities and prepare for new roles. Several school principals who support the trust do so because Gary had such an influence in their lives when they were young teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout his career, Gary worked with community members, politicians, counsellors,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        s, private companies and small business owners to try and supplement programs that would improve the learning outcomes for students. Gary also helped to develop programs for teenagers at risk of dropping out of school to help them set goals and get back into the education system. These programs are still running today, which is a wonderful thing because they will benefit students in my electorate for many years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        The trust is a great legacy and a tribute to a man who dedicated his life to educating children. Gary Walden was a champion for public education who was very passionate about children with special needs and their right to an education. Today, even though he is no longer with us, I would like to publicly thank Gary for his outstanding contribution to education which will continue to help students in my electorate for many years to come. Gary, you will always be remembered by your family, your friends and the community you served.
