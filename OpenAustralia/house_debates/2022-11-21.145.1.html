       <p>
        I'm working to have one of the latest Arafura-class offshore patrol vessels named the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>

         </a>
         I
        </i>
        and, for the first time, to have Bunbury designated as its ceremonial home port. There's a rich history of service for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Navy
        </a>
        from two previous ships bearing the name of HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        . HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        <i>
         I
        </i>
        was a Bathurst-class corvette minesweeper built in Australian shipyards in Queensland and launched in 1942. She was engaged in minesweeping and convoy escort duties.
        <i>
         Bunbury I
        </i>
        was decommissioned in 1961, with the ship's bell given to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Bunbury" rel="nofollow">
         City of Bunbury
        </a>
        , in my electorate. The date on it is 1943, and it sits in the Bunbury City Council chambers to this day. HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        <i>
         II
        </i>
        was commissioned in 1984. It was a Fremantle-class patrol boat engaged in border protection and maritime security operations. It supported special forces operations, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. This ship was decommissioned in 2006.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, in that great tradition of vessels named HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        , I'm calling for one of the new Arafura-class patrol vessels being built currently to be named the HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        <i>
         III
        </i>
        and—for the very first time—for Bunbury to be designated as its ceremonial home port, as it should. Bunbury is a very well-known and strategic port city, and the port of Bunbury has excellent facilities to accommodate the vessel during its visits. I can also see so many people in my communities around the whole of the south-west coming to visit the local HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        when it's in port. We can accommodate this vessel during its visits, and it will also foster a very special connection between the City of Bunbury, all of our people and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        . I have an online petition, and I'm asking people to help. Let's get this done. It's really appropriate that HMAS
        <i>
         Bunbury
        </i>
        <i>
         III
        </i>
        actually have Bunbury, in the south-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , as its ceremonial home port. I also want to give a warm welcome to all of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
