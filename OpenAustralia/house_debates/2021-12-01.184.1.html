        I've been blessed since 2010, when I was first elected to this place, to be represented in my Riverina electorate by fabulous mayors. I represent a dozen local government areas, and each and every one of them has a fantastic mayor at the helm. Local government elections will be held this Saturday across

        , and good luck to all the candidates, because it takes courage, as we know, to put your hand up for public office. Whilst people realise that local government is all about roads, rubbish and rates and getting the little things done, they do play a very important part in the three-tiered levels of government that we have in this nation. Three long-serving mayors of the 12 mayors in my electorate have decided not to contest the elections, and I want to pay tribute to them today: Coolamon shire mayor John Seymour
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        , Lockhart shire mayor Rodger Schirmer and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        mayor Greg Conkey OAM. I also want to pay tribute to their wives who have partnered them on this journey and have led the shires and the local government areas as well as their husbands, I have to say.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Seymour's wife is Margaret, and she is a fabulous lady. Like him, she is also an Order of Australia medallist. John has been 23 years on council. He was first elected in 1999—seven years as deputy mayor, nine years as mayor—and he's done a wonderful job. Rodger Schirmer's wife is Alison, and she's been a wonderful support. He's been nine years on council and was immediately elected deputy mayor. He was elected mayor in 2016, so five years in the top job, in the big chair at Lockhart.

        of Wagga Wagga mayor is Greg Conkey OAM and his wife, Jenny, is also an OAM. Greg, like me, was in that noble profession of newspapers. He, like me, was an editor, and I've known Greg for many, many years. He was first elected to council in 2012 and has been mayor from 2016. It's not easy being the mayor of a very large, vibrant regional capital, but he's done a great job. He's been one of the drivers of getting the levee bank, along with state and federal government funding of course, around our city to protect our city. He edited and managed the

        newspaper for 26 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the time remaining I want to thank and wish good luck to the nine other mayors in my electorate: Bland's Brian Monaghan, Cootamundra Gundagai's Abb McAlister, Cowra's Bill West, Forbes's Phyllis Miller OAM, Hilltops's Brian Ingram, Junee's Neil Smith, Parkes's Ken Keith OAM, Temora's Rick Firman OAM and Weddin's Mark Liebich. I have to pay special tribute to Phyllis, who is going for the presidency of Local Government
