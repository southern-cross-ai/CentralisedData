        We know that cycling is becoming a very popular pastime and is very much a practical alternative mode of transport for many people given the high petrol prices, concern over climate change and the desire to lead healthier lifestyles. In fact, cycling is the fourth most popular physical activity for the age group of 15 and over, with almost 50 per cent of the people in that category cycling at least once a week. This is indicated also in the growth of bicycle sales across Australia. Bicycle sales continue to eclipse those of motor vehicle sales, outselling cars for the ninth consecutive year. In 2008 there were 1.2 million bikes sold across Australia and, when you take this into account with the cost of purchase of accessories and servicing of bikes, the bicycle industry in Australia is worth approximately $1 billion and employs an estimated 6,000 people.

        Being physically active is a vital part of a healthy lifestyle and cycling is an activity that can be undertaken by people of all ages. We know that numerous studies have found that cycling provides a variety of health benefits to lifestyle. I know that cyclists in my local community are looking forward to new bike tracks being built in the local area.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbelltown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Campbelltown City Council
        </a>
        is planning a kilometre-long triathlon track at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Fields" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Fields
        </a>
        , which is a project that I have been working closely on with Glenn Schwarzel, President, Macarthur Triathlon Club, to secure. Also, importantly, the council is developing a new cycle path to link with car parking in the CBD of Campbelltown. That project will cost about $350,000, which has benefited from the Rudd governmentâ€™s national bike paths fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        These cycle ways will play an important role in getting many people active who would not ordinarily ride on roads. These local infrastructure projects are welcome news in my community, given the health studies released only recently, which found that one in every two people aged over 16 in the Macarthur region is obese. These are areas of concern and something that we need to address in a positive way and give people options for a lifestyle that is going to be conducive to better health outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Campbelltown City Council which is planning for the future by building new bike paths. These are vital pieces of local infrastructure and are very much focusing not only on the present but also on the future in developing our local communities.
