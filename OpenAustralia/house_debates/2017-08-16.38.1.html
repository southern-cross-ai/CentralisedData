        I associate myself with the fine remarks by the member for

        . I rise today to talk about a great local organisation in Shortland, and that is the University of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This is an organisation that was founded in 1972 in France. There are chapters all around Australia doing a great job, letting semi-retired or retired Australians pursue education and other pursuits in their days. I'm proud to say Eastlakes

        is the largest U3A in the country, with 800 members. I'm delighted to say that 50 of them have come to parliament today, led by my predecessor,

        . They got to meet some great parliamentarians, including the members for Bennelong and Lilley. There are too many to name. I know the Chief Opposition Whip dropped in on them. They had a great time. They had some really great questions, and I apologised in advance for question time! They're a great organisation that I've worked closely with in the four years I've been in parliament and an organisation I want to work closely with in the time I have remaining here. To pursue education at any stage of your life is a great, great, pursuit, and to do it when you have time to give back to the community, as so many members of U3A do, is especially applaudable. Welcome to parliament, members of U3A. I hope you had a great time and have a safe journey back to
