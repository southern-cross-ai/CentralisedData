        CanRevive is a wonderful organisation. We are fortunate in these roles in that we get to meet and work with tremendous community organisations. We shouldn't have favourites, but I must confess that CanRevive is one of my very favourite organisations among those I've come across in the last 10 years. CanRevive was founded in 1995 to provide support for people in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chinese" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community suffering from cancer, and their families, and for 28 years it has provided incredible support to thousands of families going through that most difficult of times. On 17 June I attended CanRevive's 28th annual dinner, and it was great to see its president, Eric Yeung, the foundation's chairman, Stephen Liu, and all of the other key people who make CanRevive what it is.

        CanRevive has been in Hurstville since 2008, and last year I was fortunate to assist in opening the new CanRevive centre in Westmead, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It's a wonderful organisation which has raised millions of dollars from the community over the years, because the community recognises the incredible depth of the services it provides. Well done to everyone at CanRevive.

        On 9 June the St George Arts and Culture Festival was held at Marana Auditorium. It was co-organised by the St George Community Alliance and the Ocean Dream Cultural Art Centre. I want to acknowledge and thank the organisers: the event's executive planner, my good friend Nancy Liu; and the event's chief director, Helen Payne. The event featured an art exhibition, and Ginger Li, from the Australian Chinese Heritage Paper Art Club put together that exhibition with her customary professionalism. It was a great night. There were hundreds of people there. The plan is for this to become an annual fixture on the St George calendar, and, judging by the success of the first event, I think we can look forward to many more years of this event.

        Bankstown Basketball Association is coming up to its 60th anniversary, having been founded in 1964. I recently caught up with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , Christian Gobolos, who does a terrific job. We've got literally thousands of people who play at the courts. There are eight courts at the Bankstown Basketball Association in

        </a>
        . With the Bruins and so many other teams who play there, it is a very professional operation indeed. It's one of the largest basketball centres anywhere in Sydney. So many of the people who play at the centre live in Banks in places like Panania,
