        It is with great pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge a great Canberran,

        , on his retirement from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Legislative Assembly. John was first elected to the assembly in March 1998, making him one of the longest serving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
         MLA
        </a>
        s since self-government. He has had a colourful career in politics and his sense of humour and oratory will be greatly missed by his colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        John was born in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        in 1949, migrated to Australia at the age of three and moved to Canberra in 1968. He undertook
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Service" rel="nofollow">
         National Service
        </a>
        and served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Army Reserve
        </a>
        . Before entering politics he was a public servant for nearly 30 years, earning him the Long and Dedicated Service Award for the ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a MLA John has been a longstanding member of several committees and served as a minister in a number of portfolios such as Disabilities, Housing, Community Services and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . He has been a fine representative for he electorate of Brindabella and his contribution to the local community in the ACT has not gone unnoticed.
       </p>
       <p>
        John is also a fierce and one-eyed Collingwood supporter, and I join with him in saying: go Pies! I am confident John Hargreaves will look back on his many years in politics with pride and I wish him all the best for his retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing I want to say that I am proud of the Raiders' achievements this year and congratulate
