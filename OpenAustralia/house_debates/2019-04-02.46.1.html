        I'm wearing the colours of Umina United football club because this week we are celebrating an announcement for the peninsula. It's a really exciting announcement. Over the weekend I was joined by nearly 100 members of the local community for a barbecue to announce that the Peninsula Recreation Precinct at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umina_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Umina Beach
        </a>
        will undergo a multimillion transformation, with $8.25 million in commitment from this government to upgrade the precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our sporting clubs are the lifeblood of the community on the peninsula, and this project is about making sure that our kids have access to outstanding sporting infrastructure, connecting families and our community together and making sure there is something for every age group. I had the chance to sit down with some of the kids using the tired skate park that's currently there and members of some of the local sporting groups, and they shared with me just how much this means for them and how proud they are, knowing that the peninsula will have access to some of the best sporting infrastructure and facilities around.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to Rod Unsworth, Tony Winch and Mark Nitsos from the Umina Community Group for all their hard work over the past two years in advocating for this and for bringing the community together in the process. I'd also like to pay special tribute to Gabby Greyem from Jasmine Greens Park Kiosk for her continued advocacy for this project and the peninsula. And to each and every person who signed the petition, sent me an email, came up to me in the streets and added their voice: this happened because of your voice and your commitment to our community.
