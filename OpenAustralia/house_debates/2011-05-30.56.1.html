        to asylum seekers, he has marched and argued for what he believed in. As former New South Wales MP Meredith Burgmann noted, 'He was involved in most of the great political protest movements of the time.' Bob did live through interesting times. He was one of three people who chased down and restrained the man who tried to kill

        Although he was a Labor Party member Bob was probably to the left of everyone in the current federal parliament.
