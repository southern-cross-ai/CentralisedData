       <p>
        [by video link] This week, my constituents can drive to a local state-run vaccination centre to protect themselves from COVID-19. I and the Mayor of Hume, Joseph Haweil, joined to make representations to the Victorian government, which subsequently announced the establishment of Australia's largest drive-through mass vaccination centre at the former Ford site in Campbellfield.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that the road out of repeated lockdowns is vaccination. Unfortunately, there are some who have tried to blame communities in my electorate and culturally and linguistically diverse communities generally for being vaccine shy. The fact is that the majority of my constituents are very keen to do their bit to make themselves and their communities safer, but accessibility to vaccines has up to now been a real problem. Services in the north-western suburbs have been limited and difficult to navigate.

        s play an important role in providing trusted information about vaccines, but there are currently fewer than 10 GPs in Hume that can administer both Pfizer and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        vaccines.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that, in an environment where misinformation can run rife, accessibility and availability are key to delivering on the momentum to get vaccinated. The new facility in Campbellfield will make a great difference, and I'm very pleased that the Victorian government has recognised that and responded accordingly. I also welcome Premier Daniel Andrews's announcement today that some 500,000 appointments will be available to the very critical 16- to 39-year-old age group for vaccination.
