        I rise to pay tribute to the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club. It is a club my colleagues from Shortland and from Robertson know well and appreciate, particularly the member for Shortland, as previously the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club fell within her electorate. It was only at the last election with the boundary moves that it has come to Dobell. I would like to pay tribute to Mr Bruce Kirkness, who has been president there. Even though in the past few years Bruce’s health has not been all that good, he has continued to oversee what is the largest seniors club in Australia, with over 6,000 members.

        These are very active seniors. In fact, the motto of the club is: ‘Old dogs can be taught new tricks and life does begin at 50’. They really do believe in this motto at the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club. The sorts of activities that are undertaken are a lot more than just housie. There is housie; exercise; importantly, teaching older Australians computers; a variety of craft groups; sporting groups; dance groups; a choir; and indoor games groups. There are a whole variety of activities that are undertaken and organised by the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club which benefit the local community. That is why it is such a large club—6,000 members. This is a club that raises its own money. It does not rely on grants from either the state or the federal government for its recurrent funding. It is totally self-funded in that sense.

        They have a wonderful canteen there. I advise anyone who is visiting the electorate of Dobell to go to the canteen of the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club. You can get some beautiful sandwiches that they make daily. They are very fresh and terrific. But I do give a word of caution: if you are there just dropping in—as I was just dropping in one day, as I do rather regularly—be prepared to be roped into an activity. When I was there, I spent half an hour linedancing. That was not the intention of my visit, but they saw a new person come in and they said: ‘Here we go. Let’s get him involved in one of the activities.’ I did think it may have been a reflection on my grey hair. Perhaps they thought I was getting close to 50—which I am not. It was wonderful to be welcomed to the club. This is a terrific club in this area—one that welcomes people of all ages, but particularly those who are over 50. I commend the work of the Toukley and District Senior Citizens Club. It is a great pleasure to recognise them here.
