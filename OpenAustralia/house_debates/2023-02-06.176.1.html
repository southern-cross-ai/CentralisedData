        One of the organisations in my community that we are immensely proud of is Community Support Frankston. We are proud of the work the organisation does, the people who work there and the amazing volunteers who give up their time. Community Support Frankston helps people in my community who are in dire financial and other stress, sometimes short-term, far too often long-term. They're always struggling for more funding. In my heart I wish we didn't need organisations like Community Support Frankston. I wish that there weren't people in such need that they have to turn to an organisation for emergency support, but I'm so very glad that, until the time comes when we can work out how to make that a reality, we do have the amazing people at Community Support Frankston.

        During COVID they helped many people who had never needed help before, and the demand for their services went up exponentially. That demand really hasn't reduced, and that's why I'm really proud that a lot of lobbying and a lot of work have led to Community Support Frankston receiving an additional $92,123 in funding for the 2022-23 financial year. It will make a significant difference to them and, importantly, to the people in my community who are being helped on a daily basis. Thank you to the government for that support.
