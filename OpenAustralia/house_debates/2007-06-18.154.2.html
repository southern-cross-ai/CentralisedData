         Kirribilli House
        </a>
        and to the Prime Minister’s response in question time last week, where the Prime Minister assured the House that there were guidelines governing the use of official residences. When were those guidelines developed, have they been amended and can a copy be tabled?

             <p>
              The Prime Minister stated that he had oral advice in relation to the use of Kirribilli for the Liberal Party function on 1 June. Why was oral advice necessary, who requested that advice, who provided that advice, when was that advice provided and can the parliamentary secretary perhaps table for the benefit of the parliament any evidence of that advice? I refer also to the 1 June function and ask the parliamentary secretary: who catered for this function? I also refer to the Prime Minister’s statement about reimbursement of additional costs for this function and ask the parliamentary secretary: what was the actual cost of this function? I refer also to the 1 June function and ask: were any departmental staff in attendance and, if so, what functions did they perform?
             </p>
             <p>
              The Prime Minister wrote a letter to the Leader of the Opposition on 14 June, in which he revealed that the Liberal Party had paid back money to the Commonwealth for three other functions. Can we be provided with a cost breakdown for each of those functions—food, drink et cetera and the number of people in attendance? How were the costs reimbursed by the Liberal Party calculated? Has the same methodology been used for each of the four functions that have been identified? You might want to answer them now.

                   I do not know when the end is, of course. A sensible way to handle this, given the number of questions, is for me to respond towards the end of the allotted time, taking into account any questions that are asked not just by the member for Grayndler but by any other members as well. Those that I can answer here, I will answer here. Those that I can take on notice, I will take on notice.

                               Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is precisely our point. I do not know what the member for Fraser is going to raise—that is why I proposed, given the choice, that it would be sensible to address all of the issues raised in one section at the end. That is why—

                                 I just want to speak on this matter of how these particular consideration in detail arrangements are being handled. I have never heard or seen a set of arrangements so designed to prevent people getting information rather than to facilitate them. It is true that the parliamentary secretary should be entitled to expect members to say, ‘I have concluded all the questions I have on that particular section,’ and then expect the parliamentary secretary to respond. I realise the standing orders cannot force him to respond, but it is the only sensible, reasonable and normal thing to do—for example, I have some questions to raise about
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
                                  COAG
                                 </a>
                                 . Why you would want to answer COAG questions in the middle of questions about Kirribilli I cannot imagine.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 So it is perfectly reasonable for the parliamentary secretary to say at the end of five minutes, ‘Is that the end of all the questions in that area?’ and if not for the person to go on until they are concluded. It is totally unreasonable to say, ‘Go for 40 minutes and then I will tell you what I am going to say about Kirribilli, about COAG’—about any other matter that someone might come along and raise. So let us try and get the procedure a little more cooperative, get all the questions in one particular section and then get such responses as we have and then go on to the next section, and I think we might do a bit better.

I want to try and get from the department and the parliamentary secretary some sort of understanding of what action the government has taken with regard to the several independent reports that have come forward identifying the massive waste of taxpayers’ dollars involved in unnecessary duplication of administration and particularly in relation to the manner in which specific purpose payments are managed and the duplication that is envisaged.

                                       , which says in its report that the cost to the federal government of administering grants to the states—that is specific purpose payments over and above the costs of either the states or the federal government directly funding and running the programs themselves—is $861 million, and overlap and duplication in areas where both the states and the federal government are operating at the same time is $913 million. And there is also an analysis of cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth and vice versa.

                                       Access Economics $9 billion figure for economic costs. I do not want to refer to the $9 billion figure, firstly, because it does not all relate to costs to government—some of it is just costs to the economy—and, secondly, because I am not sure that I agree with all the analysis. But it is a very powerful estimate. Even if we say it is double, that Access Economics has doubled the actual number, the overlap and duplication cost is $860 million. Let us say it is only $400 million and the second area of overlap and duplication is $900 million. Let us say it is only $450 million—that they once again got it totally wrong—we are talking about cost to the taxpayers of about $1 billion. There is no sign of any action by the government to save any of that money.
                                      </p>

                                       The state heads of treasury have got together and looked at the way in which specific purpose payments are administered. They have said there are problems with specific purpose payments—lack of flexibility and efficiency incentives, duplication of roles and responsibility, costs of compliance and administration—and we have seen examples raised by Allen Consulting of specific purpose payments that cost more to administer than the value of the grant. They have had lack of consultation and blurred accountability.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Then we had the report of Allen Consulting into, amongst other things, specific purpose payment arrangements. They raised a whole series of problems about the inefficiencies generated by excessive attention in specific purpose payments for control of inputs instead of control of outcomes, which is hard to define—outputs at least. We get excessive regulation and detail at a massive cost to the taxpayers at both levels—and they are the same taxpayers—and to the economy as assessed by Access Economics. I wonder whether the department and the two associated departments engaged in this—but I will ask it in the context of PM&amp;C—have focused any attention on this and whether they have done anything to seek to save this money.

He said that he thought there could be major savings in the health portfolio, an interesting claim to make and one that this side of the House notes very carefully. I am not aware of any material that this department could provide.

I have no material that would enable me to add to what the Prime Minister has said in the House. I refer the member for Grayndler to a number of points the Prime Minister made in the House about the costings, the advice and the sequence of that.

I also make the point that, when the member for Grayndler and those opposite spoke about these issues, they merely confirmed to the Australian people their complete inability to make policy in key areas that are of vital importance to the Australian people.

                                         The member for Grayndler listened to those quotations which confirmed that, unlike the function the Prime Minister hosted which was not a fundraiser, the fundraising at Kirribilli occurred solely under Prime Minister Hawke and that the figures that were expected—if I remember the quotes from Marian Wilkinson’s book

The House should note that the member for Grayndler has not, to my knowledge, said one thing about his view on that matter. Have you criticised former Prime Minister Hawke or former Minister Richardson? No. There is silence. That absolutely highlights the complete hypocrisy of the member for Grayndler and of those opposite when they talk on this issue.

                                          I am pleased that we have at least had some engagement from the parliamentary secretary. However, we have had no defence with regard to the facts around the 1 June fundraiser held by the Liberal Party at Kirribilli. It is interesting that, in his defence of the Prime Minister, the parliamentary secretary has again asserted that this was not a fundraiser even though the Prime Minister said at his press conference last Thursday that it was. Indeed, the business observer registration form for that function indicates that, for the payment of $8,250, the only functions that cannot be bought into—that is, through additional tickets open to people who do not pay the full amount—are morning tea with chiefs of staff, the Senate afternoon tea and of course the Prime Minister’s welcome reception at Kirribilli. With all due respect to our good Senate colleagues and the chiefs of staff, the big attraction is pretty clear. If you add up the cost of the additional tickets that are available for each of the other functions, even if you went to two at one time, you would pay a total of $1,300. So an additional $6,950 can be seen as being paid for that Kirribilli function alone.

                                          I also note that it is argued that people were somehow there at the invitation of the Prime Minister. However, the registration form makes it very clear that forms had to be returned with payment to the federal council’s secretariat by Monday, 30 May 2007 and that all cheques had to be payable to the

                                          that is open to anyone who can afford the $8,250 fee. We were told that some $5,186.78 was returned—that is, for food, $2,128.50; beverages, $1,476.52; casual staff, $829.57; and hire charges, $752.19. That was stated in the parliament on Tuesday, 12 June. It is interesting that last Thursday the Prime Minister stated that additional money had been paid back by the Liberal Party, for security. In the letter to the Leader of the Opposition on 14 June, the Prime Minister stated, ‘$5,186.69, and an additional amount only advised to my office today of $312.45, that being for security.’ My question is: at what time was that additional $312.45 paid for security, was it only last week and, going to the other functions that have been held, when were the payments made for the 1999, 2002 and 2005 functions?

                                           My understanding is that the member for Grayndler should have no difficulty criticising former Minister Richardson. But let me just point out again his complete inability to criticise, even in the mildest sense, what can only be regarded as an outrageous misuse by that former Labor minister and the former Labor Prime Minister. Let us recall the details in that book, which were relayed to the House last week, of $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, maybe even $100,000 back in 1987. What would those dollars be worth today, 20 years on? They would be worth significantly more.

                                           I neglected to mention the other feature I recall from that revelation last week in the House of Representatives that, specifically, those guests invited to that dinner were asked not to provide the cheques to the

                                           until after the election—I will stand to be corrected, but I think the book also said this—thereby ensuring that some disclosure provisions could be circumvented. I think that is what the book said. At that time, I am not sure who the federal director, or in Labor’s language their campaign director, was; but it may well have been—and I will stand to be corrected—the member for Fraser in 1987. Is that right? The election was in July. So we have a situation of great hypocrisy here.

                                             It is very interesting. The member for Fraser was their campaign director. This money was raised. It is not in dispute. But the member for Grayndler cannot even bring himself to mildly criticise let alone mention this. We now know, through confirmation from the other side, that the member for Fraser was spending the money that was being raised, at the very least. I think that, when he interjected, he said that the money would not have come to the national head office of the Labor Party. That raises all sorts of other questions, doesn’t it? I tell you one thing, Member for Fraser: in 1987 I was 20 and in 1987 the member for Grayndler would have been about 30—or am I being cruel?

How does it differ from the 1 June fundraising event at Kirribilli where $5,100—now $5,400—was repaid by the Liberal Party? What was the cost to taxpayers of this event? How many

Was advice sought prior to the 18 October function, or was it sought last week, perhaps even on Saturday, as a result of inquiries which were made? How many other Liberal Party functions have been held at the Lodge and Kirribilli House for which taxpayers have paid the bill? Could the parliamentary secretary table the details of each of these functions, what they cost the taxpayers, who was in attendance and any advice which suggested that it was appropriate that taxpayers pay the bill?

                                                 Again there is a whole series of questions there. Let me deal with some of the last questions first. On the issue of legal advice with respect to electoral donations, which I think was the import of the member for Grayndler’s question, he stated that there was legal advice of a clear breach. That is not correct. There was legal advice, as is my understanding from watching news reports last Thursday evening and reading press reports on Friday, obtained by the

                                                   had determined its position. When the member for Grayndler says that in his view there is clear advice I think he is referring  to the advice obtained either by himself or by the opposition. That is my understanding. I know that those opposite have sought advice. I saw advice littered through the papers on Saturday from one person whose name I recognise: Anthony Lang. Unless he is someone with the same name as a very well known and longstanding member of the Labor Party, then it is the same Tony Lang from Melbourne. The point I am making is that I am sure those opposite will get legal advice, but the Australian Electoral Commission—an independent agency—has determined its position on this matter.

If the member for Grayndler was being at all level headed and sensible he would recognise that point. As to his very specific questions, I am not aware of any of the detail. To the extent that I am able to provide him with detailed answers, I will do so in the normal way. I will treat them as questions on notice and any replies that are forthcoming will be provided in the normal way.

                                                    On behalf of the opposition I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister that the opposition has no disagreement with the idea that the Prime Minister is entitled to have people visit and attend the prime ministerial residences. We do take issue with the fact that there are two residences—unlike what other

With the 2005 and 2007 invitations, the program outlined four business observers. In 2005 it makes it clear that the fee of $7,500 is a conditional amount to attend the fundraising function at the Lodge. In 2007 it is $8,250 at

                                                    It is clear that, unless there is payment made for the hire of the venue, the concern is that having such a fundraiser at Kirribilli House saves the Liberal Party money—compared to if they had to hire a private venue—and therefore increases the amount of money made from that fundraising activity. The reason that disclosure of gifts is there is to stop people donating and not disclosing through the normal processes. It is quite clear that the figures, which go to $9 a head for food and some $6 a head for drinks, for the Kirribilli House fundraising function—which has become known as the cash-for-canapes affair—are simply totally inadequate. Anyone who knows anything about Sydney prices knows that. The Prime Minister was given the example in the parliament of the restaurant Guillaume at Bennelong, just across the harbour. The starting price there is $60 per head, and that excludes alcohol and venue hire.

                                                    The concern here, as I think Australians know, is that to get food and drinks for that price they would have had to have caught the fish out of the harbour themselves—and perhaps hopped the fence and shucked a few oysters themselves. That simply is not the case. That is why we are asking for the real costs of that event. We reiterate that to the parliamentary secretary. I am surprised that he has not had a single answer prepared on any of this—this has been a prominent issue for nine days now and yet the representative of the Prime Minister, before this session of the Main Committee, has not been able to provide a single figure. So I ask again: what were the real costs of the 1 June cash-for-canapes function held at Kirribilli House to raise funds for the Liberal Party?

I will finish where I started on this. The more the member for Grayndler talks, the more he confirms that those opposite have no serious policy plans for the Australian public. We know that the member for Grayndler has been spending all of his time researching catering menus around Sydney. We are sure that he is an expert in that field and we are sure that he and some of his colleagues have spent every minute of every day researching various menus for various catering facilities. But the issues he raised have been answered. He cannot hide his complete hypocrisy on this issue—his failure to mention former minister

To the extent that any new information can be provided, it will be provided—and he knows that. This whole issue speaks for itself. I am sure he will have further questions. I thought he would have raised them today in the parliament or at his morning doorstop interview, but of course he did not. He has asked all of his questions and, to the extent that any information can be provided, it will be provided.

We note that, between the Prime Minister giving his press conference just prior to two o’clock last Thursday and the 6 pm news, the AEC released a statement saying that they had received advice—which of course had been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his press conference—and that that advice was from the Solicitor-General. Will the Prime Minister’s office ensure that there is no intimidation of the AEC or its officers over this issue and allow for the proper consideration of the independent legal advice which has been provided to the AEC?

My question is: Attorney-General, given the discussions you have had on numerous occasions with the legal fraternity and the Family Court registry staff in Newcastle, what impact will this further study have on bringing about a new Family Court facility in Newcastle and on attaining a Federal Court in Newcastle?

I know that needs have been identified by the local profession and have been mentioned to me by the Family Court and the Chief Federal Magistrate. There are issues about accommodation in the context of the adequacy of the present accommodation and the term of the present commitments. This is about ensuring that there is resourcing to make the further judgements as to what is required and about ensuring a proper recognition of the court’s needs. When an appropriate proposal is developed, I am sure it will be something that the government will want to support.

We have a Constitution here in Australia and there is a doctrine of the separation of powers. I have sometimes wanted to look at the performance of a number of our courts, and I have wanted to help the parliament to obtain information about performance so that some objective measurements could be made. I am told that there may be some willingness to look at some of those issues in a generic form, but they are matters about which the courts have a very strong view. So I would have to say that there are no specific proposals for the sort of monitoring that the honourable member suggests is possible.
                                                                  </p>

                                                                   </a>
                                                                   has been extraordinarily successful. There has been an enormous shift in the matters that are being dealt with in family law generally from the Family Court to the magistracy. There is some data published about the extent to which requests are made in particular jurisdictions for matters to be transferred from one list to another. I notice that the member for Brisbane is in the chamber, and he may want to speak later. I saw some figures for the Brisbane court which demonstrated that the requests to the magistracy ran into many hundreds. The requests to go back to the Family Court were about a quarter or even less than that on the information that I had seen. I get anecdotal information as well from practitioners about how the federal magistracy is performing with very high levels of productivity. When you have the profession in some areas speaking with their feet, it suggests that it is doing very well.
                                                                  </p>

One would expect that the workload of the matters that are more complex and more difficult might demand more time and certainly greater deliberation than less complex matters.
                                                                  </p>

I understand that she has been very highly regarded, both as a magistrate and now as a Family Court judge. I might say that she is not alone. There are a number of others who were similarly able to be successful magistrates and whose qualities were later recognised in an appointment to the Family Court bench.

But if he were to be so rewarded, he would find himself pressed by somebody from this side of the House on those same issues and be in the unfortunate position of not being able to elucidate very fully. There are good reasons for that. As to issues that go to security agencies and the way in which they are resourced to carry out particular functions and the skill sets that they have, to discuss those would, I think, prejudice security. I am perfectly happy for the honourable member to be briefed on those matters separately, but I do not think it is appropriate to canvass them in a broad-ranging debate, save to say that the importance of having linguistic skills is not something that escapes the attention of others. That is all I would want to say.

Debate has arisen today—or it has been heightened today, I should say; it has not arisen just today—about the adequacy of our Federal Police numbers. I would appreciate the Attorney’s assessment of the adequacy of our existing Federal Police numbers and what measures he thinks may be needed to improve the availability of

The way in which those resources are deployed, of course, presents some very significant management challenges for the commissioner and his management team because the work in relation to Commonwealth issues has been growing in complexity and number. Some of them, we understand, in relation to pornography and paedophilia, which I mentioned today, are matters with which the Australian Federal Police, given the volume of complaints, may have some difficulty. There are other areas in which the Commonwealth is expected to be involved in enforcing laws. We resource the Australian Federal Police in this budget to be able to deal with copyright issues, because they have not been seen as a priority matter before.
                                                                        </p>

The large number of overseas deployments have put them under very considerable pressure. Traditionally, there have been overseas deployments. The Cyprus one would be well known for the fact that Australians have participated in it over a long period of time. That has given the opportunity not only for the Australian Federal Police but also, in a number of cases, for senior police from our states and territories to participate offshore.

                                                                        </p>

I am not making those decisions, but I am not sure that that is necessarily the case. But it is the complaint, particularly of the association or the union representing police that, if you look at the state police services, they have a larger proportion of commissioned officers. I think they were talking about 80 per cent in some of the statements I saw and they suggest that the Australian Federal Police is something of the order of 60 per cent. I think that does reflect the fact that some tasks can be undertaken by people who are not necessarily sworn officers and the capacity of the service is not necessarily reduced.
                                                                        </p>

I know that there are reports that they have been poaching staff from state and territory police services. It is the case that, as part of its staffing for both the international deployment functions and aviation security, we have advertised quite extensively and have sought to fill positions in that way. But, in relation to the actual strategy, and the proportion that are commissioned and the proportion that are undertaking other tasks, I will get the honourable member a further written brief.

While we are on the subject of the AFP, I also invite the Attorney-General to give us some idea of when he thinks the government will finally have sufficient numbers of personnel to meet the Wheeler recommendations for airport security. There is, as I understand it, still a shortfall in those areas—that is, for response teams at the airports from the Federal Police and Protective Service. I am not sure whether he will have that on hand. He might also care to take that on notice.

I have some familiarity with this. I have a daughter who actually went to the Solomon Islands as a public defender.

I think, in relation to those issues, there has to be a very clear view that, while one asks questions and probes in relation to these matters, in the end it has to be a professional judgement as to those deployments; and I would leave them in the hands of the commissioner.

David Opas, who was shot, I used to brief when I was a young solicitor in Sydney. Richard Gee, whose home was bombed, was a specialist adviser to the select committee that I chaired. So, from time to time, issues do arise in relation to the safety of our judicial officers, and we regularly make proper risk assessments in relation to those matters as we do in relation to other office holders. Certainly, in the present climate, the security measures which the courts have been putting in place have been seen as being measured and appropriate. The courts take advice from the PSCC on what is required and, as part of their core business funding, they are expected to implement them.

It is not a political point, as both sides of the chamber are concerned to ensure the security of our courts and that those who service them are protected. But, in some respects, I would have to say that I did not get an answer to my question at all. I got a nice bit of political speak that handsomely took up 2½ minutes of the time remaining but said nothing about any additional measures that might be afoot for the year ahead. So I assume that there are no additional measures afoot for the year ahead. If there are, I am sure the Attorney will correct me, or one of his advisers will set me straight. So I will leave that area, given that I have about two minutes left. If the Attorney can add to it, I am sure he will do so, using up the two minutes.

The government said that they were going to establish AusCheck back in December 2005. It commences in July this year. Would the Attorney comment on why it took 1½ years to get AusCheck up and running? But, more to the point in terms of its future and the budget at hand, how many employees does the Attorney anticipate AusCheck will have? Can he provide details of whether they will be full time, part time or casual? Also, I note that the AusCheck website talks about providing ‘capacity to be used for other background checking purposes’. How many employees does the Attorney anticipate will be tasked on those other background checking purposes? Has the Attorney got in his mind a particular area that might fall within that very broad category of ‘other background checking’?

Initially, we envisaged that we might be able to do that by regulation. But, as part of the Senate review, I gather that is one of the adjustments we made. I have just had a nod that indicates that my recollection was reasonably correct. So there is nothing proposed at the moment, and you will hear about it if we bring forward legislative amendments that seek to expand it. I will try and get the numbers for you, but I think the delay reflects a lot of the nature of parliamentary democracy where issues are debated, committees review and you have to get legislation through. You do not start to budget and appropriate money to carry out particular purposes until you have a proper lawful basis for doing it. I will also get you advice on what the courts are doing in relation to security matters. But I emphasise again the point that I made: security for the courts is core business.

My office contacted the AEC after receiving that information from the Prime Minister’s press office to determine whether that was truly the case. My office was told that the journalist in question asked a hypothetical question—Kirribilli was not mentioned—about the disclosure of buildings in relation to events for fundraising. The officer, Kevin Bodel, provided an answer based on the hypothetical question. The journalist then went on to ask questions about Kirribilli. Kevin Bodel, I am informed, told the journalist, ‘Well, we would need various information before we could make any comment about Kirribilli.’ My office was concerned that a journalist was writing a story that included a quote that was contrary to what the AEC said was the way in which the conversation between them went.

Certainly, Mr Bodel was not told any such thing by me or my office. I did not speak to Kevin Bodel myself. I only spoke to the commissioner much later in the evening, when, I think, the story was already filed. I also should emphasise that, in making the inquiry about this story that was going to be published the next day, my chief of staff spoke to the Electoral Commissioner first and, subsequently, to Kevin Bodel. But I cannot shed any light on that comment, and I once again refer the member for Bruce to the very definitive statement made by the Electoral Commissioner. This continual questioning by the member for Bruce here and through media releases indicates that he does not believe the Electoral Commissioner, and I think that is appalling.

If there was confusion that might have led to the situation developing as it has then we ought to try to get to the bottom of it. On that point, though, are you saying quite definitively that you have checked and confirmed with your chief of staff that no direction was given and that no discussion occurred around the need to not say any more until the position was clearly understood from the commissioner’s point of view or anything like that?

As the Electoral Commissioner’s statement indicates, they are independent and they certainly received absolutely no direction whatsoever. I say once again to the member for Bruce that the Electoral Commissioner could not be clearer than he was in the statement in this regard. There were no questions, muddying or anything like that. The statement that he made was absolutely clear cut. The continual questioning of this by the member for Bruce simply says to me that he does not accept the statement made by the Electoral Commissioner—and he should.

I should also point out to the member for Bruce, to save him some questions perhaps, my understanding is that the government, via the Prime Minister’s office, I think through the Attorney-General’s, obtained their own legal advice from Mr Burmester. And the AEC, quite independently, obtained their own legal advice.

From what I heard him say, he seemed to think that the AEC’s advice was the same as what the government got. That is not the case. The Attorney-General obtained advice directly from Mr Burmester. The AEC, independently, had already instigated the processes to get their own independent advice from the

I suspect that the member for Bruce might have told the Labor Party’s independent legal advisers that this was a fundraiser, and they may have ruled in relation to that.

                                                                                                                      I would like to explore with the minister some different matters regarding the department of finance’s role in overseeing government expenditure generally. I draw the minister’s attention to page 1022 of this year’s Budget Paper No. 1, which indicates that expenditure across departments would be $49 billion. Last year’s equivalent Budget Paper No. 1 at page 1023 indicated that at that point the forecast expenditure across departments would be $54 billion. So expenditure has come in $5 billion under what was expected in last year’s budget papers. I want to explore with the minister whether that is a real change or whether there has been some change in the methodology of accounting practices that would account for that difference. If there have been changes to the methodology, could the minister inform the House of what those changes and their implications are? If there have not been changes in methodology and it is a real difference, perhaps the minister could indicate what has caused that very significant variation over the last 12 months.

I suspect that answers to the following questions might be in a similar vein, which I understand and completely accept.
                                                                                                                       </p>

This year’s budget paper shows that to be a negative amount of $9.82 billion, but the estimate in last year’s budget paper was for there to be a positive $122 million at this point of the cycle. So again we see a $9 billion shift, which is a significant amount of money in anybody’s book, without any explanation that I can see in the budget paper or any other public explanation from the government as to why that has changed. I imagine there has been some change in accounting methodology, but could the minister take on notice whether that has been the case? Could he take on notice particularly whether there has been a change in methodology and, if so, what that change in methodology encompasses and what the difference is? If there has been such a change, could the minister provide, within the best of his department’s ability, a profile of departmental expenses based on this new methodology or classification over the last three financial years?

I would now like to turn to the issue of annual appropriations for depreciation, particularly of information technology expenditures. Could the minister confirm that, under the accrual budgeting mechanism, agencies are provided with annual appropriations to cover depreciation expenses of information technology? In addition, could he confirm whether they are separately allocated money to upgrade their

Could the minister also confirm what programs the Department of Finance and Administration has in place across the government to ensure that there is no double-dipping—that is, that departments and agencies are not receiving funds for depreciation which are meant to, over the long term, deal with issues of replacing equipment on a rolling basis as opposed to major upgrades? What mechanisms are in place to ensure that there is no double-dipping? Can the department provide the total amount of actual depreciation expenses for each year since 2000 funded through the price of outputs appropriations and other appropriations, including through additional estimates? The last part, clearly, the minister will need to take on notice. Perhaps he may have some information on the earlier parts of the question, or he may wish to take it all on notice.

It is a great program, particularly for members who represent electorates in rural and regional areas. In the latter half of 2006, either $120 million or $150 million was spent on the program. I cannot remember exactly what it was. I know there were applications for substantially larger amounts of money than that—about tenfold.
                                                                                                                            </p>

In doing so, part of the additional funding was made available in this financial year. There were projects that had already been submitted and assessed as being appropriate but they could not be funded because there was not enough money originally allocated last year. There was an extra $250 million that could be spent. In explaining those differences, I am not exactly certain whether that affects what the member is talking about in this cash accrual aspect, but I will check it.

There could be a perfectly legitimate and reasonable explanation and I have misunderstood it. On my reading of it, particularly the sentence ‘The fiscal impact over three years 2007-08 to 2009-10 is due to funds being fully expended as projects are completed’, it is very unusual in that normally funds are expended when they are spent.
                                                                                                                             </p>

Is the minister able to provide, either now or on notice, information on the government fleet—in particular, the number or percentage of the government fleet that is able to use ethanol, how many of the fleet are fitted out to use

My information is that they are not out of kilter, but we will give you the full detail of that. The only thing I can say off the top of my head about the fleet is that 85 or 90 per cent of the fuel that Comcar purchases is E10. That is gradually worked up as new stations are located so that Comcar can access E10. I think the use of E10 is highest in Canberra.

I am not sure to what extent they have been compiled because, as you would be aware, it is up to individual drivers as to where they buy their fuel. You would have to sort of bring it all back together, and I am not sure whether that has been done or not. For the figures with respect to the number of
