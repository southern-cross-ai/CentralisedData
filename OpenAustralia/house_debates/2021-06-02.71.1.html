         From North Queensland to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         , we're talking about Queensland because Queensland is one of the powerhouses of this nation which is going to help us recover from COVID-19. It's leading the way as far as making sure that there is agriculture, resources, growth and jobs. I congratulate each and every Queensland member for the role that they are playing in this process, certainly those on this side of the House. The government is spending $110 billion on infrastructure. That's supporting 100,000 workers. In the budget, there is another $15.2 billion of infrastructure, and that's supporting an extra 30,000 workers right across the nation, particularly in Central Queensland. What an economic powerhouse, what a driver of growth, that particular region is. And it's led by the member for Flynn. Indeed, the member for Capricornia has a large part to play in that, and the member for Dawson—I could go on. I think you get my drift.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are so proud of the fact that the resources sector is strong. Iron ore prices are
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         $208 per tonne today. Our agriculture, as the minister for agriculture will tell us, has grown $6 billion, despite the drought, despite COVID, despite bushfires, to $66 billion, and we'll get on and make it a $100 billion sector by 2030. Our annual
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         has grown 1.1 per cent in the March quarter. That is good news. We should be talking that up. We should be proud of that. As we come out of COVID-19, and hopefully that won't be too far away—but we're a long way from it yet—we are going to be having to rely on those regions, particularly Gladstone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our $100 million Gladstone port access road extension is enabling our resources to more efficiently reach the port to be shipped to export destinations around the world, and of course we've invested $2.1 million in the Biloela heavy vehicle bypass in the member for Flynn's electorate. The mayor of Banana shire, Councillor Neville Ferrier, said: 'This project will create up to 10 local construction jobs, supporting the council's workforce and local contractors at a time it's needed most. The bypass has been a priority here for some time, so we are proud to be working with the Australian government to make it a reality for our community.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Our $2½ billion investment in the Local Road and Community Infrastructure Program is driving jobs in every corner of the nation, but particularly in the electorate of Flynn, where, indeed, the eight councils are receiving $54.8 million, $7 million to Banana shire—
