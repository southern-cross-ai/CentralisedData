        I rise to pay tribute to

        , who passed away last week. John was a

        and Queensland. John moved to Rosebank on the

        North Coast with his wife, Romey, many years ago. They later moved to Bangalow, and it was there last Sunday that his family and friends gathered to celebrate what was an extraordinary life.

        John Stubbs was, in many ways, larger than life. He was always generous with his time and generous with his advice—which was always very astute. John was born in Cunnamulla in Western Queensland, in 1938, and he worked for a variety of newspapers throughout the nation and throughout the world. As his friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Atkins" rel="nofollow">

        noted:

       <p class="italic">
        John Stubbs's commitment to equality—economic, social and racial—was an unrelenting constant in his life. He saw poverty and racial exclusion up close in Cunnamulla and he never gave up highlighting the consequences and agitating for change.
       </p>
       <p>
        John was regarded by his peers as one of the greatest political journalists of his generation. He was an inspirational person because of the life he led and because he actually made a difference. He was also a big story teller with a great sense of humour. His career in journalism started after he won a prize for an essay on the temperance movement—a story he would often tell with joyous laughter, especially after a few red wines.

       <p>
        John will be sadly missed by his friends and his community, and especially his good mates Craig McGregor,
