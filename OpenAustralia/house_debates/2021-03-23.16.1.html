        Today marks 10 years since Tony Abbott's stood on the lawns of this parliament and ridiculed our first female Prime Minister with signs instructing Australia to 'ditch the witch'.

We are leaders and the community expects us to do nothing less. This has reached a tipping point. We must do better.
