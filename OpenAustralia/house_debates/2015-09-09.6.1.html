        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's seventh report of 2015 which deals with three projects referred to the committee in June. The first project is for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        and concerns redeveloping
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Barracks
        </a>
        at Swanbourne in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Since 1964, this site has been home to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Special Air Service Regiment
        </a>
        . Since that time, the regiment's role has expanded and it has doubled in size. Much of the infrastructure and engineering services also date back to the sixties. Existing facilities are inadequate for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SASR" rel="nofollow">
         SASR
        </a>
        needs. By building new facilities and re-using existing facilities where possible, the works aim to address a number of deficiencies. These include problems associated with ageing and obsolete working accommodation, a less than optimal layout, inadequate storage and poor infrastructure. The estimated cost of the project is $223.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received a briefing from Defence and conducted a site inspection and hearings on 6 August. I should state that for the chair of the committee, Senator Dean Smith, it was quite an emotional inspection because we started with laying a wreath at the memorial at Swanbourneâ€”and the first name on that memorial is that of Senator Smith's uncle,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Smith
        </a>
        . During the inspection, the committee saw the ageing infrastructure. The committee noted how the current layout makes achieving operational efficiency challenging. The committee is convinced that Campbell Barracks requires significant redevelopment so that it can continue to support effective and efficient operation of the Special Air Service Regiment. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed. In recommending that the project proceed, the committee is mindful of matters raised by local residents, particularly the suggestion that a proposed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Housing Australia
        </a>
        redevelopment at an adjacent site could compromise the security of the barracks and its personnel. The committee understands that Defence is currently conducting a security review of Campbell Barracks and has requested a private briefing on the outcomes of the review. The committee trusts that, informed by the review, Defence will appropriately manage any security issues that arise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project I report on today is also for the Department of Defence. REDFIN Phase 1B will provide the facilities needed to support a new fleet of special operations vehicles. It will also upgrade Defence's long-range patrol radio system to support special operations. Where possible, Defence intends to re-use and upgrade existing facilities. The project is expected to cost $50.5 million. The special operations vehicles are currently housing temporary hangars. The works will develop permanent and secure vehicle storage hangars, hardstand areas, inspection ramps and fuel storage facilities. These facilities will be constructed at Holsworthy in Sydney and Campbell Barracks in Perth. Fixed control stations for the long-range patrol radio system will be delivered in four locations: at Holsworthy, Campbell Barracks,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Lavarack Barracks
        </a>
        in Townsville and at the Defence facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Springs
        </a>
        in Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received a briefing from Defence and a site inspection on 6 August, with hearings the following day. At the public hearing, Defence stated its intention to award construction contracts to local small and medium businesses where possible. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final project is for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        . It concerns modernisation works to the Air Traffic Services Centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Airport
        </a>
        . The project is expected to cost $23 million. Air traffic management systems used by both Airservices and Defence require replacement. The two agencies have partnered to develop OneSKY, a single civil-military air traffic management system. To support the introduction of the OneSKY system, Airservices need to upgrade the mechanical and electrical infrastructure at the Perth Air Traffic Services Centre. The current building, which has been in operation for 33 years, also needs to be refurbished and the security improved. It is expected that these works will extend the life of the building for a further 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received a briefing from Airservices and conducted a site inspection and hearings on 7 August. During the inspection the committee saw the ageing infrastructure that needs to be replaced and the crowded working conditions in the control room. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost, and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding, I would comment on the committee's recent liaison with government agencies regarding post-implementation reports, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind agencies that post-implementation reports are required within three months of project completion. Additionally, the committee should be informed of any changes to scope, time, cost, function or design as they occur, so that the Public Works Committee can do its job appropriately. I commend this report to the House.
