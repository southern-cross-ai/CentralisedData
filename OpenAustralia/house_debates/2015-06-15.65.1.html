        Earlier this year tragedy struck Bennelong with a horrific car accident claiming the lives of three constituents. Seven-year-old Ben Milne was the sole survivor, losing both his parents and his older brother. Ben suffered a broken leg and spinal injuries that had him placed in an induced coma. Thankfully Ben is now on the road to recovery. His back brace has been removed and he is finally free of his wheelchair. Ben has no other family here, so his aunt and uncle travelled from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and took him into their long-term care. When he is finally fully recovered they intend to return with him to England to start a new life there. I am immensely proud to say that they have not been alone during this difficult time. The whole Bennelong community has rallied to their cause, supporting the family while they are without income and providing some very intensive care. Ben's school, Truscott Street Public School, has been phenomenal in its fundraising. I have to mention the P&amp;C. At a special event I attended just recently they raised $37,000. This is truly a remarkable achievement, and I congratulate everybody involved. I am sure the House will join me in wishing Ben Milne and his new family the very best in the future.
