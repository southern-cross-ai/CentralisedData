        Constable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Woods" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Woods
        </a>
        was simply doing his job, trying to help keep our community safe, and what happened to him was an absolute tragedy. I'd like to offer my sincere condolences to Constable Woods's family, his friends, his fellow officers at the Belmont Police Station, the wider police family—because that's what it is—and his footy mates, the Winnacott Eagles. I know what this will mean to them, and I know what he would have meant to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Emily, his wife: Emily, I am so sorry that you've lost your much-loved husband. I'm sure when you kissed him goodbye that morning you never for one moment thought it would be the last day of him being on duty as a police officer. His life was cut so short. He was just 28 years of age. As I said, Constable Woods was simply doing his job, carrying out his duty as a police officer in protecting and serving his community, on 8 June.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the nature of the incident, can I also offer my deep sympathy to his fellow officers, in particular, his partner, who was present at the time, and the additional officers who assisted in recovering Constable Woods, who was trapped beneath the vehicle following the incident.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that they will not need to close their eyes to be able to see what they saw at that time. I think it will live with them forever.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is still very raw for many of us in WA. So many of us were shocked and absolutely saddened when we heard of Constable Woods's injuries. Following the incident, and despite the critical nature of his injuries, many people were just hoping and praying for Constable Woods's recovery. However, he passed away three days later.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also offer my condolences to my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West" rel="nofollow">
         South West
        </a>
        District Superintendent Geoff Stewart and all of the officers in our South West who are doing similar work to what our officers do right around Australia every single day. That is, the work that Constable Woods was engaged in.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are 7,000 WA police officers and police officers right around Australia who are out there day in and day out, doing their best to help keep us safe. They face those similar critical situations on a daily basis. In my opinion, from what we're seeing now, the threat and risk to those people is increasing. Every time they approach a vehicle or attend a call-out, they are at risk. The heightened nature of this comes as a result of what we're seeing on a daily basis. Some of the shocking crimes we're seeing committed are even directly against police themselves. As recently as January, even on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Forrest Highway
        </a>
        in the South West, a police car was rammed head-on while a police officer was simply attempting to pull over a car. We read almost daily about shocking crimes and incidents that police attend as first responders.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the families, as well, of our police officers—those like Emily. I want to thank them for supporting their loved ones in the work they do to help keep us safe. They certainly need the support of their family all of the time.

        also commend the work of Police Legacy and note how heart-wrenching it will be on National Police Remembrance Day on 29 September this year that Constable Woods will be the 88th WA police officer to lose his life while serving our community. But he will never be forgotten by his family, by his friends and by his fellow police officers. This is the ode that was written by WA police chaplain

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Woods" rel="nofollow">
          Anthony Woods
         </a>
         , a true hero who, in the line of duty, made the ultimate sacrifice. I can only imagine the profound sense of loss for his wife, family, friends and colleagues. There has been a shared, collective grief which has washed over all
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         ns, and I think it's because Constable Woods stood to serve and protect our community—to keep us safe. Constable Woods fought for his community during the pandemic, and he kept on fighting for his life during his hospital stay. But, sadly, he lost that fight due to his traumatic injuries. Everyone deserves to go home safe from work, including police officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think there's another reason for the collective grief. Anthony was just 28 years old. He was happily married, a freshly minted police officer, a pretty good football player at his club, the Winnacott Eagles, I hear, and a passionate Eagles fan. He had so much that lay before him.
        </p>
        <p>
         I honestly was not so mature at 23, but Anthony, at this age, decided that he wanted to become a police officer. Anthony joined the Western Australia Police Force as a trainee in 2019 and was admitted into the force in 2021. His graduation marked the beginning of a promising career.
        </p>
        <p>
         He had the potential to make a lasting impact to my community of Swan. I remember when the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold across the world. Fear rippled throughout our community, and Anthony was one of the many police officers who bravely stood in the frontlines during the crisis. He selflessly put himself at risk to ensure the safety of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         community. When Anthony took on duties at Kensington Police Station, he showcased versatility and adaptability as an officer. Just last month, he was stationed at Belmont Police Station, where he was poised to embark on a fulfilling career.
        </p>
        <p>
         The impact of Anthony's loss reverberates throughout Western Australia, affecting us all. However, it's his beloved wife; his parents, Natalie and Todd; his siblings, Nathan and Brooke; his extended family; his friends; and his fellow police officers who will bear the heaviest burden of grief.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will now share some of the many messages of condolences shared with me from my community to show how deeply affected people felt. Tony Andretta wrote:

         Our deepest condolences are with his family and colleagues during this difficult time. I would particularly like to acknowledge the first responders at the scene, who, by all accounts, acted with great bravery and urgency at the time of the tragedy, and who must be heartbroken to lose a friend and a colleague. I can only imagine how confronting that scene would have been. May they find solace in the memories of Anthony's unwavering dedication, commitment and sacrifice both in the line of duty and to his family. As we mourn his passing, let us also celebrate his life and the impact he made in his short time with us.

         Legacy and my colleague the member for Tangney, Sam Lim, a former decorated police officer, I understand that Belmont Police Station has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of messages, condolences and gifts. The support was truly unexpected. The blue family are strong, but they're even stronger with community support. I would also like to acknowledge the work that WA Police Legacy has done in supporting Anthony's family. I understand that they work tirelessly every day and support over 400 widows and 50 children.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is during times like these that our strength and resilience shine the brightest. Together, we can ensure that Constable Anthony Woods's legacy lives on, inspiring future generations and serving communities with honour, courage and unwavering dedication, but most importantly reinforcing the message that everyone deserves to go home safe.

          Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge the previous contribution by the member for Swan. I'll just acknowledge that it is extremely difficult to give a speech about a member of your community who has lost their life serving that community. Thank you.
         </p>
         <p>
          I stand here today to contribute to this condolence motion for Constable
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Woods" rel="nofollow">
           Anthony Woods
          </a>
          , a police officer who will forever more rightly hold the title of 'hero'.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the execution of his duty, providing us with a peaceful society so we can live our incredibly fortunate lives, he paid the ultimate price with his. On Thursday 8 June at 1 am, Anthony and his partner were working when they intercepted a suspected stolen vehicle being driven by a 23-year-old person who had recently been released on bail. As a result of that intercept and the circumstances that followed, Anthony lost his life in the most horrific way. He was transported to hospital, after his partner did everything he possibly could to try and save his life, where he was placed in an induced coma and then finally succumbed to his injuries on the 11th.
         </p>
         <p>
          Anthony served his community for three years, and, as a former police officer, I know what that's like. I know that journey. It's a proud journey. But it's a journey where police put themselves forward, not to wear a uniform, not to have power, not to hold a gun on their hip. They do it to help their fellow citizens. That's what they do it for. And that's what he was out doing when this terrible tragedy occurred. He was out helping his citizens. It highlights not just how fragile life is but also how these things can happen so rapidly. For police, every intercept could be exactly what we've seen here. An unknown risk is a high risk, and every car that you pull over—you just don't know. It could be as dangerous as that horrible domestic violence incident that you had the knowledge of before you went. Police do this every night. They're doing it all of the time, and we need to acknowledge as a society the dangers in which they operate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Anthony's probation report said he was a great all-rounder and an officer that any community would want responding when they call triple 0. I can envisage Anthony, although, obviously, I didn't meet him. He would have been a proud young constable, and he would have put that uniform on with pride. I was told once by a person I had a great deal of respect for that, when you put that uniform on, you are embodying every good citizen in the community. There is an immense amount of satisfaction in doing that and doing it properly, and that's what he was doing.
         </p>
         <p>
          My deepest sympathies go out to Anthony's colleagues at the Belmont Police Station. It will be a very difficult time not only for you but for the wider community. Hold your mates close. Spend time with your family. Do all of those things that you know make you stronger. This is the nature of policing, unfortunately. Take care of your mates: that's my message to those people.

          This loss comes only a relatively short time after the horrible incident in Wieambilla in Queensland, where Queensland lost two members of its police service and a citizen, Alan Dare. The members were

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_To_Wall" rel="nofollow">
           Wall To Wall

          ceremony will be held. At the ceremony, which is held every year, sadly, new names are added to the bronze plates on the memorial wall on

           Lake Burley Griffin
          </a>
          . It will be a sad time in September. I'll be there, and I would encourage any others who can be at that ceremony to come along and to show their support for their brothers and sisters wearing the blue uniform. My deepest sympathies go to Anthony's wife, Emily, his mum and dad, and his broader family.
         </p>

          Rest in peace, Constable Anthony Wood.

           We stand here in this place as representatives, and as far as workplaces go it is a relatively safe place. Police officers are also representatives, in the sense that they go out every day and stand where most will not stand and do what most cannot do. They work at the difficult and unpredictable face of executive government, fulfilling tasks that few of us would be able—or, still less, willing—to do. Their work is necessary, and when they do their work they do it on our behalf.

           passed away earlier this month in hospital from injuries received while carrying out his duty. He was run over by the driver of a vehicle while the arrest of that person and two other occupants of the vehicle was in progress. Tributes for Constable Woods have been made by the premier and the police commissioner. The commissioner stated that Constable Woods exemplified the values of the

           Force.

           This terrible event occurred in Ascot. Ascot is not far from the city. Many or most people in Perth pass through Ascot on a regular basis, and when we do so we don't expect to be attacked or killed. Police officers carry a different burden. They know that they will often be asked to put themselves on the line, and they know that the people they will very often have to deal with will be unwell, emotionally stressed, drug affected, or just too immature or morally deficient to properly govern their own behaviour. Police officers stand there on our behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
           I add my condolences to the many that have been expressed. For the colleagues and first responders, for the family and friends of Constable Woods, taken too young, I'm sorry. May you draw strength from the community around you, the love that's being expressed from across the country, and the support of Police Legacy to get you through this time.
          </p>

           As legislators here and in the states, let us continue to find ways, across all portfolios, to reduce and remove the precedent conditions that can lead to these events taking place at all. That is our role in this. I'm grateful to be joined by the member for

            I rise to pay my respects to Constable
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Woods" rel="nofollow">
             Anthony Woods
            </a>
            , who tragically lost his life on 11 June this year after succumbing to his injuries after being dragged underneath a vehicle. I didn't know Anthony Woods, but I know Anthony Woods. I say that because in my 12 years in the police force in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            there was a common thread, and that was family—the family in the police force. And it actually doesn't matter whether you're serving or you've left, or if you've retired: there's always that common thread. It's an understanding that you've all done the same thing, have done that job and have worked together.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can stand on prepoll for hours and hours and I'll have ex-police or current police come up to me. Someone might say to me, 'I was in the Queensland cops'—great—and you'd have that conversation, because you'd have that understanding and camaraderie. That could be said internationally, as well. I know that every police officer in Australia today and on 11 June would have been thinking about Anthony Woods.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've seen some photos of Anthony in the media. I can say that I know he would have loved his job. The look on his face—he would have loved getting up every morning, or at night time going on night shift, pulling on those black Baxter boots and going out there and doing that job, and part of that would have been doing that job with his mates. He wouldn't have walked out that door thinking, 'I might have to face danger tonight,' because that's just assumed. Every single police officer walks out the door like that because they walk into this job with eyes wide open, as I did in 1989. What you see with your eyes wide open is different, but you know that's part of the job. Yet Woodsy—I'm sure they called him Woodsy—would have walked out that door looking forward to going to work, looking forward to working with his mates and looking forward to the job in which he swore to protect our communities. And that's exactly what he did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I offer my condolences to his family—his wife and his extended family. There will always be pain. But after time, the memories of him will fill your heart. I offer my condolences to his mates, his work colleagues. And the families of police should be recognised today because they let those police officers walk out the door every day, knowing that this may happen. It's quite unfair to them, but it's a choice that they make because they love their loved ones. They know they love their job. It's a sacrifice that the families of police officers make. So I thank you, the families of police officers, for letting your loved ones walk out the door every day to serve us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, I recognise the first responders. That would have been one of the toughest scenes to visit, knowing that it was one of them, knowing that it was one of theirs. Having been to many incidents, I thank God that none of them were people known to me or loved ones. I offer my thoughts and my prayers to the first-responder community around Australia and thank you for what you do for our communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Might I just recognise Peter Addison and

            , who were two senior constables working at the Kempsey police station back in 1995, a station where I once worked, who both lost their lives in a tragic shooting incident. It's been 28 years, but we still remember them, as we will always remember Constable Anthony Woods. Again, thank you to all the police officers, and vale, Anthony Woods.

              Police Force for the past three years, Constable Woods was just 28 years of age.
             </p>
             <p>
              As we often rise in this place to speak on matters, this is probably, in my time in this parliament, one of the saddest, saddest times I've had to speak. I feel so, so sorry and so upset for his family. So young and with so much life ahead of him, he was the 88th police officer in WA to die in the line of duty. He was only a month out of his probationary period and no doubt really looking forward to the future ahead of him. He had a career and a life that were sadly cut short.
             </p>
             <p>
              To his family, I express my deepest condolences. Losing a loved one is absolutely devastating. Losing them in a tragic and unexpected manner can be so much more heart breaking. To his wife, Emily; his parents, Natalie and Todd; his brother, Nathan; and his sister, Brooke: I say how sorry I am for your loss.
             </p>
             <p>
              May you remember all the best times you had with Anthony. As you grieve, I know that the hearts and thoughts of all

              I'd like to share some history on Constable Anthony Woods to build a picture of the wonderful and fun man that he was. Prior to joining the police force, he volunteered at the Police Community Youth Centre, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
               PCYC
              </a>
              , a club that exists so that disadvantaged youth and children at risk across Western Australia have a safe place to go, somewhere they can feel at home, make friends and do things that young people do. Constable Woods joined the police force as a trainee in 2019—I can imagine he was very proud—and he was inducted into the academy in 2021. After his graduation from the academy, Constable Woods started his career as an officer posted to Operation Tide, where he served on the frontline protecting the Western Australian community during the challenges of COVID-19. Constable Woods was posted to Kensington Police Station prior to Belmont Police Station.

              On Sunday 11 June, following his death, landmarks were lit up in blue lights to commemorate the loss of Constable Woods:

              Commissioner Col Blanch spent time with the officers at Belmont Police Station on the evening of 11 June, trying to reassure them, trying to comfort them. I can imagine the devastation in that police station and an empty desk. That must have been awful. A fundraiser raised almost $14,000 in less than 24 hours for Constable Woods's family. His local football club played a tribute match last Saturday and retired his No. 3 jersey in his honour. I can imagine the atmosphere and the devastation of that football team; they were all very closely linked, no doubt friends and childhood family friends. It would have been just awful and so very, very sad.
