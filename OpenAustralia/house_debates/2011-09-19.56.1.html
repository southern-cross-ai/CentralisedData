       <p>
        As the federal member for Fremantle and the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity I would like to recognise the dedicated service of Senior Constable Kevin Jones of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WA_Police" rel="nofollow">
         WA Police
        </a>
        South Metropolitan Crash Investigation Unit, who is here in Canberra and the parliament today with his wife, Lorraine, to receive the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        . Presented by the Prime Minister, the Australian Police Medal is awarded to police officers who have served a minimum of 15 years diligent and dedicated service in an Australian state or

        force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senior Constable Jones joined the WA Police on 5 March 1965 and has spent more than 40 years in the crash investigation unit, much of this time based in Fremantle, performing an often difficult and confronting but absolutely critical role within the police force. At 68
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Jones
        </a>
        shows no sign of slowing down and he continues to carry out his duties with a high level of competence into what for many others would be their retirement years. This goes a long way to explaining why the WA Police Commissioner, Karl O'Callaghan, and the WA Police Union President, Russell Armstrong, nominated Mr Jones to be among the first Australians to receive the Australian police award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to note that Mr Jones was the first police officer to receive the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        n police medal, which is similarly awarded for dedicated and excellent service in the WA Police force. I commend Mr Jones for his long service to the people of Fremantle and Western Australia. I know he has made a difference to our community. He is an example of the contribution that many good men and women make to law enforcement in Australia. I also want to wish his wife, Lorraine, a happy 65th birthday today.
