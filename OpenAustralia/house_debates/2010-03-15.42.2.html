                       The member for Lyons! The member for Indi! Yet again, we get to the stage after question time where everybody wants to get absolutely excited, including myself, and I am trying to remain calm. There were two things at the end. It was brought to my notice that last week, in a personal explanation, the Leader of the Opposition got in the same expression as I was getting him to sit down for. I would have on that occasion asked him to withdraw. There are two reasons for this: (1) it is unparliamentary—he cannot get up and debate that on the withdrawal—and (2) by that stage, when he is saying things like that, he is entering into debate on a personal explanation. I think that for both those reasons I seek the withdrawals. I am not going to enter into an argy-bargy about the quality of the withdrawal. I accept that it has been withdrawn. I would simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: on occasions when he is asked to withdraw, it would assist the House if he did so without comment.

                        Mr Speaker, I have a point of order based on the interaction that you have just had with the Leader of the Opposition. Under standing order 91(f), which is about disorderly conduct:
                       </p>
                       <p class="italic">
                        A member’s conduct shall be considered disorderly if the member has …
                       </p>
                       <dl>
                        <dt>
                         (f)
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                         been considered by the Speaker to have behaved in a disorderly manner.
                        </dd>
                       </dl>
                       <p>
                        The point that the Leader of the Opposition has just gone to is that it seems entirely unfair and unreasonable that members of the government should be able to tell lies about the Leader of the Opposition—

                         of Opposition Business will resume his seat. He has been here long enough to know that, over several parliaments, the House has tried to struggle with this very point. I can remember members having to make personal explanations of the ilk that are being made now—day in, day out—as ministers of the day made the same accusations. This was something yet again in those previous parliaments that the House did not address. I believe that I am applying the standing and sessional orders in the practice of the House as has been done consistently. If there is a problem, this is a problem of the House’s inability to actually deal with matters that have caused concern for several parliaments.

                           Order! The member for Dickson will resume his seat. I simply say to the Leader of the House that I took it that this was an illustration of this problem that has occurred over several parliaments. The indications of lying on that occasion as part of the point of order were of the ilk that has happened over several parliaments where there is frustration with the need to have withdrawals. I did not believe that it was specific to anything that happened. It was perhaps intemperate language but I understood where the Manager of Opposition Business was coming from. I sat him down before he completed his point of order. He might feel aggrieved by that and he has left his standing orders behind. But the point was that I felt able to deal with the matter because it is something that has been unsatisfactory for several parliaments. But I will continue to apply the rules as they have been applied in the past. That includes where I think that people are absolutely specifically calling other individuals or groups liars and I will ask them to withdraw. In that case, it was part of the point of order that the Manager of Opposition Business was making. It may or may not have been helpful but, as the chair, I understood where he was coming from.

                                      In question time today the Minister for Education tried to pretend that I had asked her a question last Thursday about Tyalgum Primary School on the basis of the costings of the school. I did not. The question was about why the prefabricated library that was delivered to that school did not fit the foundations when it was off-loaded from the back of a semi-trailer. That is exactly what happened and anything else is false.
