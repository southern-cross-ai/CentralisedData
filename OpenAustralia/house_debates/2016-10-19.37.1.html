        As this is Carers Week, I asked my community to tell me of their stories. I wish to honour all carers, but especially Juanita Blomberg. This is what she wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My story began on 1 September 1973, when my son Mark was finally born at 6:20 pm in the evening, after more than 20 hours trying to be born. He was described as 'blue and slow to breathe'. I don't need to look at the card to remember that day.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My daughter Allison was born on 18 April, 1977 and then I had 3 'babies'. It seemed ok—I was coping with that. It was people's attitude I wasn't coping with. It was as if they thought they would catch something from us if they got involved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let me say Ann, I am crying as I write this. My life has been extremely difficult. In more recent years, with my own disabled body, as a result of overwork and carrying the load virtually alone, there were times I wished I could leave this life …
