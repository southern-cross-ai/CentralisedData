       <p>
        Higher education is an important part of the Australian way of life, and the federal Labor government have been looking at how we can improve our system. This is incredibly important, because we want to make sure that all Australians can achieve their full potential. We have done extensive consultation with the universities, with the Universities Accord, and we've been looking at systematically working through this to make sure that all students can achieve their full potential. One of the things that we've been looking at is the issues of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        students. Under the previous government, First Nations students only had access to places if they were based in regional areas. The truth is that Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islanders
        </a>
        are all across Australia. We want to make sure that they have access to university places irrespective of whether they're in metropolitan Perth or out in Broome. We want to make sure that they have access to places, so one of the parts of this legislation that we've changed is making sure that they have access to these places.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my home community of Swan, we have the Rotary Residential College, which attracts students from all across WA, including regional WA. These students come to Perth, they study high school, they get embedded in their community and they create these community links. Often these students will decide to pursue higher education in Perthâ€”hopefully at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Curtin University
        </a>
        , which is in my electorate of Swan. When they're already embedded in the community, it makes sense that they should have access to these university places. I think that is really important. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Response to the Australian Universities Accord Interim Report) Bill 2023 is legislation which increases accessibility and makes sure we have the opportunity to unlock the full potential of these students. I see higher education as a ticket to a good start. Whether it's with a vocational qualification or a university education, I want to make sure all Australians can achieve their full potential. That's exactly what we're trying to achieve.
       </p>
       <p>
        With this review, we wanted to do extensive consultation to make sure that we fully understood the various views in the sector. We wanted to go through a methodical process to ensure that we understood the different perspectives from across the sector. I see this bill as a significant step in the right direction. I'm proud that this government did not draft this legislation in isolation. This government will continue in this way, because we are a government that listens and that acts. The recommendations garnered substantial support from stakeholders in the tertiary sector, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Technology_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Technology Sydney
        </a>
        , Western Sydney University,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Another pivotal recommendation borne out of the accord's review and supported extensively by the higher education sector is the extension of demand-driven Commonwealth supported places to all First Nations students. This is an example of making sure that we're unlocking all of the opportunities for all students, which the Albanese Labor government is incredibly passionate about. We have to strengthen the support available to students and make sure that they can achieve their full potential. Our workforce depends on this, and our nation relies on their skills and knowledge. In our rapidly changing economic landscape, we need students that can adapt to our country's evolving needs. We need to have a look at the future skills that are required for the country and work in partnership with the universities. This is one of the reasons why we had the Jobs and Skills Summit. We wanted to bring universities, businesses, community and the public together to look at different ways that we can futureproof our nation and make sure that we're achieving the things that we need to do, whether that be in the healthcare economy or related to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to make sure we have an Australia that is fit for purpose for the future, and that requires us thinking about what skills we need today. We need these skills to make sure that we teach, inspire and contribute to our communities in ways that will yield benefits for years to come. The thing that I'm confident about with this Albanese Labor government is that we're not just looking at tomorrow, we're looking at the future longevity of positive change for the nation, and that's what investment in our university system does.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, diversity in our workforce is needed, which is one of the reasons why we need to make sure we increase the number of people who have access to university education. When we have diversity with our graduates from university, we'll have diversity in our workforce. And when you have diversity in your workforce, it leads to better outcomes. We see this with boards that have women on them. Women on boards result in better economic outcomes, and we see this being proved time and time again. All of this starts with sowing the seeds at university.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to make sure that university education is equitable for all Australians regardless of where they reside. My parents did not get to go to university. My dad dropped out of his high school when he was probably 14 or 15. He ended up going to trade school. My parents wanted to come to Australia because they believed in a country that wants to invest in their people and believes in a better education. This is often the belief of many migrant families who want to see their children achieve their full potential. But we need to make sure we widen the door so that more people have access to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very grateful that our education system has served me well as these are opportunities that I might not otherwise have had, and this is a wish that I have for all Australians. This is why I wholeheartedly commend this bill to the House. I see it as a significant step forward in securing a brighter and more inclusive future for our nation.

         () (): It is no secret that education can have a powerful effect on someone's life. Educational attainment has been linked with better health outcomes, a higher quality of life and greater income. Of course university is not the only source of a quality tertiary education; however, it is a critical pillar for an education system that delivers better outcomes consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
         Doctors, engineers, accountants, teachers and allied health professionals are all educated at university and deliver vital services to our communities. Unfortunately, these services are not equally available to all, with geography often representing a significant barrier, particularly for rural, regional and peri-urban communities like mine. That's why lifting accessibility to education is doubly important. It helps not only those being educated, but also all of our communities. We cannot solely rely on bringing in doctors and teachers into these communities from elsewhere. We must provide the people already in those communities with the opportunity to fill those sorely needed professions. Education has the power to uplift whole communities, and the Higher Education Support Amendment (Response to the Australian Universities Accord Interim Report) Bill 2023 will ensure that our university system is better equipped to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>
         In November last year, the Minister for Education ordered a review into our higher education system. The Australian Universities Accord will develop a long-term plan for our higher education system. It will look at almost every aspect of our education system, not just the basic principles of accessibility and affordability but also employment conditions, teaching quality, and how vocational education and training and higher education should work more closely together to deliver better student outcomes. This bill represents part of the Albanese Labor government's response to the Universities Accord interim report, and particularly seeks to address the two immediate actions from the report that require legislative change.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill will amend the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Support_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Higher Education Support Act
         </a>
         to scrap the 50 per cent pass rule which requires students to pass at least 50 per cent of their units of study to continue to access Commonwealth assistance for their course, as well as extend the demand driven funding currently provided to Indigenous students from regional and remote areas to cover all Indigenous students. The Universities Accord interim report found that the 50 per cent pass rule disproportionately disadvantages students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as regional and Indigenous students. It has already impacted over 13,000 students right across the country, denying them access to an education.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the widespread acknowledgment the rule has failed to do anything but lower outcomes for vulnerable students, the opposition are still defending it. In his contribution to this debate, the former Minister for Education, the member for Wannon, in speaking about the rule, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This was about holding universities to account. It wasn't about the students.
        </p>
        <p>
         This simple statement fulsomely sums up the opposition's approach to education: it wasn't about the students. It wasn't about supporting students to attain a higher education. It wasn't about providing students with more opportunities to develop their skills. It wasn't about enabling students to achieve their goals for education. Rather than enhancing the support provided to students, the Liberals chose to punish those who were struggling.
        </p>
        <p>
         The accord interim report notes that removal of the 50 per cent pass rule should be accompanied by improved processes to track students' learning and engagement to hold institutions to account for identifying and supporting at-need students. That's why, under this legislation, universities will be required to demonstrate how they will identify students who are struggling and how they will connect those students with appropriate support services. In stark contrast to the approach of those opposite, this legislation is about requiring universities to support students, not forcing them to quit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second effect of this legislation is the expansion of demand driven places for Indigenous students to those from metropolitan areas. This measure aims to increase the number of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         people studying bachelor and bachelor honours courses at university by removing any cap on the number of Commonwealth supported places available to Indigenous students. It is estimated that this could double the number of First Nations students at our universities within 10 years. Sadly, like in many other areas, the gap between the educational outcomes of Indigenous and non-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         is far too wide. Only seven per cent of First Nations people have a university degree, and, tragically, young Indigenous men are more likely to be incarcerated than to graduate from university. Better access to education is essential for ensuring better outcomes for First Nations Australians in areas such as health and employment. First Nations Australians who haven't completed a secondary education are twice as likely to be unemployed, and those in remote areas are five to 10 times as likely to be unemployed. We must do better to provide educational opportunities to Indigenous Australians if we are serious about closing the gap, and that's exactly what this legislation does.
        </p>
        <p>
         While these are the two measures contained in the bill, the Albanese Labor government's response to the accord interim report is much broader. We're directly responding to each of the other priority actions of the report. We're investing $66.9 million to double the number of university study hubs and extend the program from rural and regional areas to include outer suburban areas. We understand that simple geography can be a significant barrier to higher education, and these hubs go some way to breaking those barriers down. They provide students with essential facilities such as computers, internet and study spaces, as well as in-person administrative and academic support. We are also providing funding certainty to our higher education institutions throughout the accord process by extending the Higher Education Continuity Guarantee into 2024 and 2025, as well as working with state and territory governments to improve university governance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese Labor government's plan for lasting and transformative reform to our higher education system comes off the back of nine years of neglect and mismanagement from those opposite. Over the course of successive Liberal governments, education minister after education minister sought to amend, abolish or deny equity measures that would increase access to education for those communities like mine that need it most.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberals
         </a>
         first tried to deregulate university fees, almost opening the door to $100,000 degrees, and, after that failed, they simply cut university funding.
        </p>
        <p>
         When COVID-19 came and campuses across the country closed down, the Liberals went out of their way to exclude universities from accessing JobKeeper. It was good enough for companies like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Norman" rel="nofollow">
          Harvey Norman
         </a>
         but not good enough for our universities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the Liberals introduced their Job-ready Graduates scheme, a policy that caused students to pay more and universities to receive less, and actually reduced the capacity of universities to offer courses in areas of critical skills shortage. The interim report found that continuing the Job-ready Graduates scheme would 'risk causing long-term and entrenched damage to Australian higher education'. Not only did it fail to improve anything at all; the Liberals' higher education reform package actually threatened the future of our education system.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach of the Albanese Labor government could not differ more from that of the Liberal opposition. Labor will always support our tertiary education system, spanning from our universities to the pathways provided by our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         system. We understand the enormous value of education in creating a fairer society. We also understand the need to have a diverse and accessible higher education sector that meets individual needs and aspirations as well as the skill requirements of our communities and our economy. We've already made a huge investment in TAFE and delivered 214,300 new fee-free TAFE and vocational education places, smashing the 12-month target of 180,000 in the first six months of this year. Of those 214,300, 60 per cent are women and 6,845 students are Indigenous. The most popular courses include a Certificate III in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Childhood_Education" rel="nofollow">
          Early Childhood Education

         and Care, and a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploma_of_Nursing" rel="nofollow">
          Diploma of Nursing
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Measures like this are invaluable for communities like mine. In my electorate of Hawke, TAFE courses are essential for providing educational pathways to good, well-paid employment. That's often because TAFE allows people to pursue education in their own communities, in a manner that suits them best. Unfortunately, university education is not always able to have the same impact on communities like mine because it simply isn't accessible enough. That's why the reforms in this bill and the broader response to the interim report are so very important.
        </p>
        <p>
         All Australians should be able to access an affordable education. Whether it be university, TAFE or other vocational training, making tertiary education more available to underrepresented and disadvantaged cohorts will not only improve the lives of those individuals but also uplift our entire communities. Many of us in this chamber have personally been impacted by the transformative power of a quality education. This bill is about ensuring that the same opportunity is afforded to many, many more Australians. In commending this bill to the House, I thank the minister for his tireless work in this space and, on behalf of our community, I thank him all that he does to create accessible pathways to education and further training for the community that I live in.

         <p>
          It's a great pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Response to the Australian Universities Accord Interim Report) Bill Like my colleague before me, I really want to thank the minister for his terrific leadership in this regard in making sure that we are really focused on having greater depth and greater width in particular when it comes to participation in higher education in Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Albanese Labor government has initiated this biggest and broadest review of Australia's higher education system in the last 15 years, and it is under the very able leadership of Professor Mary O'Kane. Many of my colleagues have spoken of her virtues, but I do want to acknowledge that she was the first woman to become dean of engineering at any university in Australia and I do like to make sure that women are acknowledged for the trailblazing roles that they take in our communities. She is an extraordinary Australian who is leading an exceptional team in this important task.
         </p>
         <p>
          I join all my Labor colleagues who have spoken in this place in really underscoring the importance of equity of access to higher education. It's core to our Labor values, but I think it's core to Australians' sense of themselves and our sense of fairness and equity. My electorate of Newcastle is, very proudly, home to one of the top regional universities in Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
           The University
          </a>
          of Newcastle has a strong history of achievement and strong outcomes even on those international university rankings, and it's currently ranked in the top 175 in the world. That is no small feat for a regional university in Australia. It is a university that knows a thing or two about achieving equity of access, as we have been doing that heavy lifting for the last 50 years. We know that for genuine transformation of universities to deliver high-quality educational opportunities there has to be a whole-of-institution approach. This is something we have learned from experience in the half-century now that we have been running what I would argue is one of the nation's best enabling programs.
         </p>
         <p>
          It takes systemic change to shift the entrenched structures that continue to exclude underrepresented communities from higher education. For nearly half a century the University of Newcastle has engaged with and graduated now more than 70,000 students through its Open Foundation program, which is what we often call an enabling program. It is a free open-access enabling program. Let that figure rest with you for a moment: 70,000 people in Newcastle and the Hunter region now have a tertiary education that they would otherwise never have had the chance to get a foot in the door for. In the last 10 years alone that has meant that one in five students at the University of Newcastle has entered that university via an enabling program. When you go down to the

          , which my fantastic colleagues the member for Dobell and the member for Robertson represent, it is one in four students for them that attend that university via an enabling program.
         </p>
         <p>
          The success of Open Foundation and its related programsâ€”so programs like the Yapug program, which is specifically designed for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations
          </a>
          studentsâ€”lies in the long-term commitment and continuous improvement that the university has undergone with these enabling programs for the last 50 years. It is through evidence based pedagogy and curriculum design alongside continuous research and feedback that this program has developed to ensure that students can be supported to get the skills they need to thrive at university while studying in areas of interest. Importantly, the University of Newcastle's enabling programs are free, and I underline that point because it is significant. I have stood in this chamber on three occasions now in the last nine years to save the enabling programs at the University of Newcastle because members now opposite, thankfully, sought to either cut those programs or put a price point in front of them, which would have effectively reduced those programs to almost being non-existent. I can say that with confidence because, as I said, I've spent nine years defending these programs in this House.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am so excited to be part of a government now that recognises the value of enabling programs. When you come from a community where 70,000 of your citizens have gained a tertiary education through this enabling pathway, you're acutely aware of the value of this. I have sat with those students, many of whom are now completing
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhDs" rel="nofollow">
           PhDs
          </a>
          and master's degrees because they are extraordinarily successful students, and they have said without exception that, had they had to pay for that first enabling program, the Open Foundation program, they would never have gone to university. I'll tell you why: those people traditionally enter university with such low self-confidence and faith in their own capacity that they don't see their value until they have been at university for a while and successfully completed this Open Foundation course, which gives them the necessary wraparound supports and services that give them confidence to know, 'I can do this.' They can not only do this but are smashing it out of the park now in postgraduate programs.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know the value of that enabling program. In fact, the University of Newcastle has done some terrific survey work around the students in the enabling program, and they all advised, as I've just demonstrated, that they would not have entered that program had there been a significant price pointâ€”had it cost money. A breakdown of the students that have come through the enabling program in the past six years will demonstrate to you why not having a cost in front of that is important: 61 per cent of the students in those enabling programs are first in family to attend university; 35 per cent come from low socioeconomic backgrounds; 18 per cent are from regional and remote locations; and eight per cent of those students are Indigenous.
         </p>
         <p>
          The success of Open Foundation and its related programs lies in the lifelong learning ethos; a depth of curriculum rather than the narrow competency based approach; and research informed practice. Equity, diversity and inclusion are integrated into and prioritised in all aspects of the university. It's part of everybody's job and everybody's obligation at that university to consider those factors of equity and inclusion.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are 113 countries now represented in the student body at the University of Newcastle, and the university has got the highest number of First Nations students enrolled of any university in Australia. The Board of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education and Research and the Nguraki elders committee have guided the university now for more than 10 years. The Wollotuka Institute has operated as a support centre for Indigenous students since 1983. We're coming up to a very significant anniversary for the Wollotuka Institute. They've provided unparalleled leadership and have championed academically rich and culturally affirming education programs at every turn.
         </p>
         <p>
          I join in the University of Newcastle's call for the expansion of enabling programs beyond pre-entry so that we can provide an ongoing foundation for those students that require some support. We've got some proven approaches to ensure that you can scaffold students through to complete their awards and their degree programs. I commend the University of Newcastle, its staff and educators and the students for the work they're doing to ensure that equity of access to high-quality education is always at front and centre of our thinking.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want you to know that this Labor government wholeheartedly agrees with that approach. We'll be making sure that every kid, young and not so young, gets access to high-quality education. This is not a matter that is simply for those that get to live in capital cities or go to certain sandstone universities of this nation. I commend the bill to the House.

          <p>
           I want to thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Response to the Australian Universities Accord Interim Report) Bill 2023. When I introduced this bill, I encouraged everyone in this place to use this opportunity to have their say on the Australian Universities Accord interim report. I'm pleased to see how many members took up that invitation, and I thank them for the quality of their contributions, because this is important. We have a big challenge ahead of us.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today 36 per cent of the workforce has a university agree. The accord team estimates that by 2050 that number could jump to 55 per cent. If that's right, that means that over the next 2Â½ decades the number of people at university will increase significantly. The accord team tells us that to meet that skills challenge we need more Australians going to university from groups that are currently underrepresented in higher education: students from our outer suburbs and the regions, students from poor backgrounds, students with a disability and Indigenous students. It's a big challenge, and the measures in this bill take the first steps towards meeting it.
          </p>
          <p>
           The bill delivers on priority recommendations 2 and 3 of the accord interim report. It removes the punitive 50 per cent pass rule and replaces it with stronger support for students. This rule has seen too many students forced to leave university before they have a fair crack at it, and far too many of those are the very students the accord team says we need to be getting into university. We need to help students succeed, not force them to quit, and that's what this bill does. It puts in place requirements for a support for students policy, which every university and provider must have, to help spot the students who are struggling and give them the support they need.
          </p>
          <p>
           A consultation process on the content of those policies is currently underway and will be completed before this bill is debated in the Senate in October. I have instructed my department to have the draft guideline amendments prepared for release prior to that Senate debate. At the end of the year the accord team will provide a final report, which will address a number of key issues flagged in the interim report, including the former government's Job-ready Graduates scheme. But the accord team have singled out the 50 per cent pass rule which is part of that scheme and have recommended that it go now, because of the impact that it's having on disadvantaged studentsâ€”students like the ones the member for Gippsland spoke about in his contribution: regional students who relocate for university and, to use his words, might not necessarily excel in the early days of their career.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is not about stopping every student from ever failing a subject. This is about not cutting off students unfairly when they are struggling and can be helped. It's about supporting them by identifying them early and connecting them to the help they need. That might be check-ins from academic staff and targeted course support. It might be giving access to trained academic development advisers who can help a struggling student identify what's holding them back, or proactively offering special consideration arrangements where a provider is aware of a significant life event for a student.
          </p>
          <p>
           I won't pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process on the final content of the support for students policy guidelines amendments, but we want all universities and providers to really engage on providing appropriate student support. What we heard in the Senate committee on this bill last week was that many universities already have these kinds of policies in place. The support for students policy requirements will make sure that appropriate policies apply to all universities and providers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The other priority recommendation implemented in this bill is expanding the demand-driven system to all Indigenous students. Previously, that system has only applied to Indigenous students in regional and remote areas. This bill expands it to take in metropolitan areas as well. It means that all Indigenous students can access a Commonwealth-supported place and a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
            HELP
           </a>
           loan if they meet the entry requirements for a bachelor's degree, other than medicine, at a table A university.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that the number of Indigenous students at our universities grew with the introduction of the demand-driven system, and, by expanding it, the Department of Education estimates that we can double the number of Indigenous students within a decade. What a difference that would make. This wouldn't close the gapâ€”not on its own. As I told the parliament yesterday in question time, about 45 per cent of young Australian adults have a university degree today, and only seven per cent of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           do. If this legislation works, it will help increase that from seven per cent up to 12 per cent within a decade. There's a lot more we need to do to close the gap, but it's a start.
          </p>
          <p>
           These are the two priority recommendations delivered in this bill. As I said when I introduced the bill, the other three priority recommendations in the accord interim report are also being implemented by the government.
          </p>
          <p>
           The panel recommended that we increase the number of university study hubs, and we are doubling them, from 34 to 68â€”up to 20 more in the regions, and, for the first time, up to 14 in the outer suburbs. The suburban university study hubs will be established in outer suburban areas without a significant physical university campus and where the percentage of the population with university qualifications is low. These hubs will provide spaces to support students, including those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, Indigenous students and people with a disability.
          </p>
          <p>
           On Sunday, the Department of Education released a consultation paper seeking feedback on the design of the new suburban university study hubs. I encourage participation in that process, which is open until 2 October.
          </p>
          <p>
           There will be further consultation and engagement leading to a competitive application process to establish suburban university study hubs in areas with an identified need for additional higher education support, and we will soon be announcing the first round for the new regional university study hubs. This is a really important initiative. Bringing university closer to where students live will encourage more people who otherwise might decide not to go to university at all to give it a crack.
          </p>
          <p>
           In response to priority recommendation 4, the government is extending the Higher Education Continuity Guarantee into 2024 and 2025. A working group is already underway on the fifth of the accord panel's priority recommendationsâ€”that is, that the federal, state and territory governments work together to improve university governance, specifically (1) ensuring that universities are good employers; (2) ensuring that university governing bodies have the right expertise; and (3) making sure that universities are safe for students and staff. That last area of focusâ€”making our universities safeâ€”is particularly important. It's a duty our universities owe to all of their students and staff on every campus.
          </p>
          <p>
           The working group has representatives from each state and territory. That's important because each jurisdiction is going to play a role in addressing this problem. The working group includes an expert in the prevention of and response to sexual assault and sexual harassment: Ms Patty Kinnersly, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of Our Watch. She is bringing her expertise in governance, health and prevention to the working group. The group has already held two meetings, and I encourage our universities to continue to work with us on this very important task. The working group is also engaging with student groups, like End Rape on Campus, the

           Campaign and Fair Agenda.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to thank members of the crossbench who spoke in support of this bill, particularly in this area: the member for Indi, who spoke so inspiringly of the positive impact of university hubs in her electorate; the member for Fowler, who shared with the chamber her mother's belief in the power of education, a belief underlined by her own experience as a refugee; the member for Curtin, who welcomed the bill and its support for first-year students who might struggle with university; and the member for Mackellar, who had this to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           â€¦ starting university can involve significant adjustment stress for students, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who have never been in an environment like university before and who don't have the family financial resources to fall back on. These are the very students whose participation in tertiary education we should be fostering, rather than impeding.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to thank the member for Warringah, who said of the demand-driven changes:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Access to higher education has many positive flow-on effects on broader
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           families and communities, as well as individuals, embedding generational accessibility to tertiary education.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to thank government members, so many of whom have taken this opportunity to discuss not only this bill but the impact that education has had on their lives and on the lives of the constituents they represent. And I welcome the member for Barker's confirmation that the opposition will facilitate passage of this bill and his commendation of it to the House. I want to welcome the contributions of members like the member for Nicholls, who spoke about five Indigenous women who achieved PhD places at the University of Melbourne. Here's what he had to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           They completed those, and some of those Indigenous women have told me that when they were in year 9 at school the thought that someone would call them 'Doctor' one day never occurred to them. It's great, and I really believe in encouraging Indigenous people who, as with all of us, are ready to go to university to be supported. I've seen some really good outcomes in my patch. I couldn't be prouder of those women who did that, and I'm also proud of the University of Melbourne for making it happen.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also want to thank the member for Gippsland for his contribution on the importance of education in the regions. This is what he said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           As much as there are economic barriers that we need to deal with in this place, through things like the tertiary access allowance and supporting disadvantaged students to give them the opportunity to go to university, there is also a challenge, for those of us who live in rural and regional communities, to make sure we're doing everything we can to build aspiration amongst young people.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government will oppose the second reading amendment offered by the member for Bradfield, but I'm hopeful that we can work together on getting this bill through the parliament efficiently so that we can start helping the students whose lives it will improve.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm also hopeful that we can work together on implementing some of the other work the accord team have set out plans for: improving university governance, making our campuses safer but also taking the next big steps once they've delivered their final report. There will be great opportunities in that report to shape the future of higher education in this country, with reforms that will give more young Australians a crack at getting a university education. That's coming. For now, I again thank members for their contribution to the debate on this bill and I commend it to the House.
