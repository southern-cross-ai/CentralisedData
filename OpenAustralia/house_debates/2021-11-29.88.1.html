        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. He was talking to me over the weekend about the troops who were deployed from Townsville to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         . I know that, like everyone in this House, he wishes them a safe trip. The work they're doing in the Solomon Islands obviously augments the work the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         has just commented on with regard to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         . It provides a security overlay, and it provides the ability to airlift and for people to be safely transported on some of the roads in and out of Honiara.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you'd be aware, Mr Speaker, the ADF personnel have come from 3, 17 and 6 brigades and from 4 Squadron
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         , and they have provided support, including air combat controllers, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RE" rel="nofollow">
          RE
         </a>
         combat team and further supporting elements. I say thank you to all of those personnel. It's a very significant effort that they're making. It follows a request from our near neighbours in the Solomon Islands, and it says very clearly that Australia will always be there in the Indo-Pacific, standing by our partners, our friends and our family in this part of the world to help them, particularly in their hour of need, and to make sure that we can see peace prevail in our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         The RAAF responded very quickly last week. We are able to deploy rapidly to incidents like this, whether it be for a humanitarian disaster or civil disorder or under the bilateral security treaty that Australia has with the Solomon Islands, through which we are able to provide them with assistance. The reason we can do that so rapidly, and the reason that we are resourced so well within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         , is that we've put significant additional funds into the ADF. What would make that very difficult, as we know from what Labor did in their period in government, would be reducing the amount of money into the Australian Defence Force. They reduced it to 1.5 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         . The fact is that it's now up over two per cent.

          A point of order, Mr Speaker. There's a certain dignity that this answer should have, but there's also a question of relevance. No alternative proposition was asked for in the question.

            Mr Speaker, I'll tell you why it's essential to have strong leadership and to invest in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            , which is exactly what this Prime Minister has done. We've done that because we wanted to restore the disaster that we inherited from the Labor Party. We've been able to respond to this incident and to many more because we have put the money not just into the acquisition of the equipment that the ADF needs but also into the recruitment and training of ADF personnel.
