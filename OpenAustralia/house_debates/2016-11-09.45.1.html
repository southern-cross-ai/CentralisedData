       <p>
        Recently I announced that the Turnbull government has committed to upgrading the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Leveque_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Leveque Road
        </a>
        , which will unlock the tourism potential of the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dampier_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Dampier Peninsula
        </a>
        in my electorate, as well as improve safety and accessibility all-year round for the communities along this road. This project is being funded through the government's $600 million Northern Australia Roads Program, which was born from the government's northern Australia white paper, a key blueprint which will lead to greater development in Australia's north.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, this government has committed to funding of over $24.2 million towards the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Great Northern Highway
        </a>
        to widen and improve access for heavy vehicles to Wyndham port, as well as over $58.5 million towards the Great Northern Highway near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halls_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Halls Creek
        </a>
        , replacing four low-level floodways with new high-level structures.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also recently announced nearly $30.8 million to replace the existing low-level one-lane
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_River" rel="nofollow">
         Bow River
        </a>
        bridge with a new high-level two-lane bridge. This is in addition to $12.5 million towards the widening and realignment of the Great Northern Highway between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ord_River" rel="nofollow">
         Ord River
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Turkey Creek
        </a>
        which is being funded through the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program. The Pilbara roads are also even safer, following the completed work on the Great Northern Highway's realignment at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Coastal_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         North West Coastal Highway
        </a>
        and the Great Northern Highway.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Turnbull government has kept its word about developing Australia's north to make it even greater not just for today or even for tomorrow but for many years to come, and it illustrates that this government is fair dinkum about developing the north.
