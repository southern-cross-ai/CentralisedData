        I recently had the pleasure of attending the

        </a>
        blessing and official opening of the La Chaperie Visual Arts Facility, the Ludovic Building and the Brother

        Administration Building. The projects, totalling $2.3 million, were funded through the Australian government and the state government, and there was also a contribution from the school community. During the ceremony it was fascinating to hear about Brother John Mullins, the founding principal of the college who opened the doors back in 1982. Back then, Brother John Mullins lived on site at the brother's house, which is still there today. He had a profound effect on the school community and his legacy lives on today through the family that is Trinity College. He was charged to build a school, but with it he built a community with a deep sense of family spirit that still exists to this day. Brother John Mullins worked tirelessly for the families of Trinity College under the values of humility, simplicity and modesty. It was an absolute pleasure to be able to open the new administration building in his name and to unveil a plaque. I would like to thank the principal of Trinity College, Mrs Catherine Thompson, for inviting me to be part of such a special occasion.
