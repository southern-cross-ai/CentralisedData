         I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I was delighted to be with him and quite a number of business operators in his electorate in Perth last week. There has been quite a deal of misinformation in the media over recent days about occupational health and safety and the

          Work Choices

         legislation. Let me re-emphasise the basic point—that is, occupational health and safety is the responsibility of states and territories in Australia.

            As I was saying, section 16(3)(c) of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
             Work Choices
            </a>
            legislation specifically provides that the occupational health and safety regimes of the states and territories continue to operate. Under those state and territory laws, if an employer fails in their duty of care to provide a safe workplace, there are penalties. Where an employer fails to provide occupational health and safety training, there are also strong penalties under state and territory laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it was somewhat bemusing to see Mr Bill Shorten on the television news last night declaring shamelessly that, because he had spoken about occupational health and safety at the Beaconsfield mine site, he was ‘an outlaw’.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
             Can I
            </a>
            say to Mr Shorten that he has not broken any law by speaking about occupational health and safety at the Beaconsfield mine site.

              Indeed, as the Treasurer points out, he is in no danger of being declared an outlaw and not being able to take his seat in parliament. It may worry the Leader of the Opposition a little, but he will be able to get here. But neither Mr Shorten nor anybody he spoke to at Beaconsfield—or, indeed, at any other workplace around Australia—has broken the law in this matter. Of course, some members of the opposition know this, because we had the exchange of emails with the member for Perth and the member for Lilley. We had the office of the member for Lilley saying in an email, which found its way to a constituent, ‘An employer can send employees to union training.’

                 These are words from the office of the member for Lilley. This was reinforced again this morning by the member for Perth, who spoke at a doorstop this morning. He was asked this question: ‘Why do you need those leave arrangements if employers are required to provide safety training and can do so?’ This was the reply from the member for Perth: ‘I would’ve thought that Beaconsfield shows that one of the things which are important is leave arrangements for training to take place at the Lithgow mining rescue centre, which is jointly run by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">

                 and the Minerals Council of

                 </a>
                 , and more than one of the people involved in the Beaconsfield rescue had training there.’ Precisely the point, Mr Speaker, from the mouth of the member for Perth.

                              As such, I have concluded it falls within the terms of Regulation 8.5(1)(c)—

                              that is, prohibition. Minister, doesn’t this mean that a clause for leave to attend union organised training courses for occupational health and safety matters is prohibited content in an agreement? Isn’t it the case that the

                              is right and the minister is wrong? Why did the minister mislead the Australian people on the fundamental matter of occupational health and safety in the workplace, both then and again in the answer he has just given?

The Leader of the Opposition knows that. He made a foolish statement a couple of weeks ago, but he knows that the state and territory occupational health and safety laws continue to operate in Australia.
