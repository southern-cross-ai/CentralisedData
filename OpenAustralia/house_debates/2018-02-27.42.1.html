        My question is to the Prime Minister. Last night at Senate estimates the Prime Minister's Department confirmed that he has a 100 megabits per second
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN

        connection at his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Piper" rel="nofollow">
         Point Piper
        </a>
        mansion. Why does the Prime Minister get a 100 megabits NBN connection to his Point Piper mansion when three-quarters of premises on his copper NBN can't get that speed? Why is it always one rule for this born-to-rule Prime Minister and another rule for Australians?

         There are 1.4 million premises in Australia which are able to get an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         service on the hybrid fibre coax network built by Telstra and taken over by the NBN, and 411,000 of them are active. I would remind members opposite that in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avondale_Heights" rel="nofollow">
          Avondale Heights
         </a>
         , in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate, there are more than 2,000 premises connected to the NBN on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
          HFC
         </a>
         . In the electorate of Watson there are 2,000 premises connected and in the electorate of McMahon there are 4,000 connected. All of those premises connected to HFC are able to get a 100 megabit per second product from the NBN. In fact, if they were on the Telstra network, they should have been able to get a 100 megabit per second product before the NBN took over the network.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is that 7.2 million homes and businesses are in areas where the NBN has been switched on. There are over 3½ million premises currently connected. By 2020, Australia will be the first country of our size to make broadband access universal. As I said in my earlier answer, we are connecting more premises a month than Labor did in six years. In fact, there were over 59,000 new active services in the past fortnight alone, compared to 51,000 in total under Labor.

         We know what the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do. He is trying to run his politics of envy, his faux class war. Anyone who wants to know what a fake he is as a class warrior only has to watch the video of his address to the
