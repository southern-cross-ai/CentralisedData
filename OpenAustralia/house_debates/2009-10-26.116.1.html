       <p>
        When a nation is in great deficit, when a national government has spent more money than it has received or is in the process of spending more money than it will receive, there are a huge number of programs that will face the axe. It is my sad duty to reflect the views and the concerns of the constituents of Ryan in relation to one specific program that has enormous resonance around the community, not just in the Ryan electorate but I am sure throughout the electorates of this great country. I am talking about the School Chaplaincy Program. In recent days the School Chaplaincy Program’s continuity has come into question. Certainly in the Ryan electorate this is cause for great concern. I have received literally hundreds of emails in the last 72 hours about whether the Rudd government is going to continue funding this worthy program. I have received emails from suburbs as far away as Kenmore and Pullenvale at one end of the electorate to The Gap in the other part of the Ryan electorate. Constituents there reflect all kinds of concerns about whether this worthy program funded by the federal government will continue to be a source of nourishment and sustenance for the young people in schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to read some of the concerns of stakeholders, of parents and school teachers and, indeed, local community members, who have expressed their deep reservations about whether the Rudd government will continue funding this wonderful initiative of the Howard government that was introduced several years ago. For instance, from the suburb of Bellbowrie, a lady says to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Mr Johnson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am writing to tell you of the wonderful addition to our school the chaplain has been in these past few years. My children have both benefitted from her input as have the children in my year 2 class.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been so impressed with the change in the ‘tone’ of our school I have joined the

        committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the suburb of Kenmore, one gentleman says to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe that most schools in Kenmore and district have chaplains and that parents actively support their chaplains. In the 2 years of the program the chaplains have become an incredibly important part of the school support system for all the students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe the government is under incredible financial pressure this year and next year and the chaplaincy program may well be stopped.
       </p>
       <p>
        A constituent in the Pullenvale says to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Michael …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
