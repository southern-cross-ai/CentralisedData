        The

         Redcliffe Dolphins
        </a>
        , or the 'Moreton Bay Dolphins', which is what I'm hoping they will be called in the future, are on a quest to become the second Brisbane
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">

        team, and I'm backing them all the way. The Dolphins' NRL bid is based on a passion and a desire to give their players the opportunity to compete at the highest level of rugby league in the NRL, the greatest competition of all, and to give their 40,000 members and supporters a chance to proudly cheer their team on from the sidelines. If their bid is successful, which I'm very hopeful it will be, the Dolphins will become the NRL's 17th team.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dolphins have an impressive history under their belt with the Brisbane community, which goes all the way back 74 years to the grassroots of rugby league. The Dolphins club was founded in 1947, and their first-grade team played in the Brisbane rugby league competition from 1960, joining the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Cup" rel="nofollow">

        when it started in 1996. As of today, they've appeared in 11 grand finals, won 6 premierships, and are the most successful Queensland Cup club. There was a proud moment for the Dolphins last year when the new northern grandstand of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_Stadium" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Redcliffe was opened in late September. The grandstand was made possible by and was constructed using $500,000 from the federal government's Community Sport Infrastructure Grants Program for the construction of its female facilities, $3 million from the Community Development Grants Program, as well as $2.5 million from the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish the Dolphins luck on their NRL bid and look forward to attending their first NRL game when the time comes. Go the Dolphins!
