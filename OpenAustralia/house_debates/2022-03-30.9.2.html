        which ran aground in 2010 causing contamination of an area of over 40 hectares. The proposed works will involve the removal of rubble and contaminants that are impeding natural recovery and management and disposal of these onshore. The estimated cost of the remediation works is $19.4 million, excluding

        , to be funded from an out-of-court settlement with the ship's owners and insurers. The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 17 February 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following its inquiry, the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18, subsection (7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 that it is expedient to carry out this remediation. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence from mid-2022 and be completed by 2024.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Services Australia—Fit-out of new leased premises at 120

        , Hobart, Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Services Australia is proposing fit-out works for new office space at 120 Bathurst Street in Hobart. Services Australia currently occupies three buildings in Hobart, with leases due to expire in 2024. Services Australia is proposing to consolidate these three sites into one new location, allowing for operational efficiencies and reduced operating costs. The consolidation of these sites is for office accommodation only and will not involve the relocation of existing shopfronts and services. The estimated cost of the fit-out works is $32.8 million, excluding GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 1 December last year. The committee has recommended the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18, subsection (7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 that it is expedient to carry out the works. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in January next year and be completed by June 2024.
