       <p>
        Over the past week, fire has ravaged through my electorate of Pearce in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , resulting in 1,870 hectares burnt, 18 homes lost, many homes damaged and numerous vehicles lost, and we are still counting. Infrastructure, including power poles and water assets, has been damaged. Business is impacted, including the local strawberry grower, who has lost an entire crop. My thanks go to the emergency services personnel and our amazing local volunteer bushfire brigades—Wanneroo Central Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade, Wanneroo Volunteer Fire Support Brigade, Quinns Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade and Two Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade—all of whom worked tirelessly to keep our community safe and did such an incredible job in saving homes and properties in extremely challenging conditions. I also recognise the many volunteers in our local community, who are inspirational. Consistently I see people step up to help others, whether it be a neighbour or a stranger, opening their hearts and homes.

        I cannot begin to imagine the anguish and stress experienced by residents who have lost their properties, and my heart goes out to them. The federal, state and local governments have ensured that assistance is available for those impacted as quickly as possible. The bushfire proved how fast and far a fire can travel and that living in suburbia does not mean you are immune from fire risk. Again, I give my heartfelt thanks to our incredible firies and to our community that have shown their strength in times of adversity by their generosity and love for one another.
