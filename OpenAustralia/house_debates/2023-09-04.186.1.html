        I rise today to talk about the campaign that is against people losing their property rights by reason of transmission lines and having their environment destroyed by reason of wind factories and solar factories, against having a power price that is going through the roof while reliability is going through the floor and against having overseas companies so the money goes overseas. Basically, we understand the swindle and how we're getting done over. We've now set up a national group. We've got people from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Clarke Creek
        </a>
        . We've got people from Tasmania, from Victoria and from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . I'd like to commend the people who have put their hands up to be part of the executive of that group: Grant Piper from Coolah, Hamilton Gerrand from Gippsland and Katie McCallum from Kilkivan in Queensland.

        This goes to show you that a spread of people across our nation is now forming together. They're getting coordinated and they're getting the capacity to have real political effect. I look forward to them coming down hereâ€”I really do. I look forward to them coming down here and protesting on the front lawn, because no-one is listening to them. At the bush summit in Tamworth, the protesters there had basically good, honest intentions, but the Prime Minister wouldn't speak to them and the minister for the environment wouldn't speak to them. They ignored them. The only way they're ever going to get heard is if they turn up in Canberra.
