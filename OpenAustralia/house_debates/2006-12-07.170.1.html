        The House would know that I constantly have work experience people coming through my office in the electorate of Gilmore. I will read into the

        Not long ago I had never set foot inside

        . In fact, I had barely spent much time in Canberra, and, to be honest, I didn’t particularly want to. But the cravings increased to see the Floriade, and soon Mum, Dad and I were on our way to Canberra.

       <p class="italic">
        Our friends in Womboin described Canberra as a rural town filled with national and international buildings, and it amazed me to see the surreal country plains oh-so-close to the city. I was intrigued. I had to see more. Each step I took, people would suggest things to do—’Have you seen the

        ? Have you been to the Senate? Did you know you could contact your local member?’ No, I didn’t know. So I thought—Why not! So I took the opportunity and ran with it. One-by-one, each step led to the next. And the rest, as ‘they’ say, is history.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So, less than 2 months later, I have been wowed by having an inside view of our national House, while meeting a number of those who help this place come alive during my 4 days with Ms Gash and her team at the start of November. Folk have gone out of their way to make me feel welcome and for that I am grateful!

        Before coming to you I had not much knowledge of Parliament—but each experience here has helped to open my eyes.

        got up early with the media and took notes just for fun, was shown around Channel 10 with producer Fenn Kemp, then, some ABC crew welcomed us in! Ate scones with Whip’s staff and had talks worth a mint, was lost on many an occasion but was escorted to destinations or at least pointed the way.

        Thanks to the Security for continual smiles and for standing up for me when I was almost thrown out when I was there til quite late. To the police riding bikes, and the friendly drivers I passed, to Leanne and Luke in the library upstairs—

        again on his recent trip to Condolbolin. I was there in the same town but overwhelmed by the heat! But, despite the cracks in the ground all calling for rain, I was amazed at how beautiful it was!

        Big thankyou also to the countless others who stopped, talked and opened my eyes even more to the incredible job that you people do each representing your part of the world!

        And to Jo Gash, Kay, Wally and Sam for your endless support and for letting me have, in my words, ‘free run of the house’ and for believing I was up to the challenge, and for all your time spent with me and for arranging for me to meet the

        —WOW. I have just had a most incredible experience and I’m so glad it was with you.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People everywhere so generously gave of their time—from scones and talks and tourism insights. I cannot say I know enough to talk about many issues, but one thing 1 know to be true—I love our country, and over the week I had with you I have met an incredible family of people, who are all working together to help our country Austraaalia to be a welcoming, functioning ‘home’ for people to come from all over the world and be a part of. You have an incredibly hard job. And I admire you. Keep up the awesome work. Wherever I am, I’ll be barracking. Your shoes are hard to fill. And I’m proud.
