        I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome back students and teachers for the new school year. The return to normal in 2022 saw schools holding award ceremonies, multicultural events, excursions and sporting events and opening new buildings. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank all the principals, staff and parents who made these ceremonies such special occasions for the students and also to thank them for inviting me to attend. It's always a joy to see the excitement of the children when they get an award, but it's especially fun to see their parents' faces when their hard work is rewarded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Best wishes to the teachers and principals who moved or retired at the end of last year. Your work with our students was very much appreciated. You may not know the difference you've made, but you certainly will have made one. A special shout-out to

        I was pleased also to visit a newly opened school in the Werriwa electorate last week.

        Public School opened to the relief of many parents, as they can now walk their children to school instead of driving their children to a school over five kilometres away. Whilst there are still some final touches and construction going on at the school, it will be home to 700 students, with 200 kindergarten students starting tomorrow. Good luck to the parents and the teachers. I wish the new students, the teachers and principal all the best for the new year. It is certainly special to be the first at a new school. The incorporation of Indigenous languages into the new uniform and the class names is a great innovation.

        The Albanese government recognises that more support is needed in schools and for students, so it is delivering $203 million to support student mental health and wellbeing as well as $270 million to improve school facilities across Australia. It's also incentivising more people to join the teaching profession.

        I've spoken before in this place about the need for more schools like the new Edmondson Park school in our part of Sydney. With so many people moving to the growth areas, I'm pleased that

        Labor has committed to building new high schools in Austral and Leppington to meet the needs of the students and families moving into the area. NSW Labor has a bold plan to address the chronic underfunding of public education in Werriwa, and our community deserves the best. Good luck to everybody starting school this year.
