        Students from across the electorate of Robertson have submitted their designs to my annual Christmas card competition and they've done so in record numbers this year. The competition has been growing every year, and this year there were over 1,000 entries at my office from 24 different schools across the coast. It's always amazing to be able to look at all of the incredible and unique designs that we receive. Every student's design is turned into a Christmas gift tag pack as a way of recognising and acknowledging their efforts in creating their own designs.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Sunday, we gave out over 1,000 of these gift tag packs to members of the community at the annual Christmas fair at Mt Penang parklands in Kariong. My congratulations go to 11-year-old Edith from

         Green Point Christian College
        </a>
        , who was awarded first place this year. Edith's design is beautiful, and it represents the theme of this year's competition: the joy of Christmas. Lauren from Copacabana Public School received second place, and Lillian from Gosford Public School was awarded third place. Well done to all of you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations also to Lauren from Holy Cross Catholic School; Codie from Green Point Christian College; Bridie and Edith from

        the Baptist Catholic Primary School; Willow from Umina Beach Public School; and Grace from Avoca Beach Public School. They all received highly commended awards. I look forward to meeting all of the award winners and their families at our annual presentation afternoon tea next week. It is always a great opportunity to hear directly from the students on what inspired their designs and drawings. I wish all residents in my electorate a very happy and safe Christmas.
