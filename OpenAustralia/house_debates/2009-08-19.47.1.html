        My question is to the Treasurer. Now that the Treasurer has confirmed that the cabinet this year considered an income tax surcharge but, as he said, it was not adopted, can he rule out any such increases in income tax during the term of this government?

         As I said before, the Henry review is comprehensive, and we are not going to play their silly, childish game of ruling in or ruling out. But what we can do is have a comprehensive discussion in this House about taxation: what has happened in the past and what could happen in the future. So I welcome questions from the Leader of the Opposition about taxation, because it is pretty hard to put your finger on what the alternative tax policy of the opposition is. We heard yesterday about the Leader of the Opposition’s 289 proposals. I am told it was originally 290 but they could not count and left one out—

               Yes, Mr Speaker. It was a question about tax policies, and when I was interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition I was referring to the 289 or 290 proposals that he had put forward four or five years ago. But there have been some more contemporary statements.

As I indicated to the member for O’Connor last year, I can arrange for some of the people on my right who wish to commentate during question time to be given a position up in one of the soundproof booths. I will listen carefully to the Treasurer’s response. I have invited him to relate his material to the question, but give him more than two or three seconds to get underway again.

                  Mr Speaker, it was a question about the 2009 budget and it was a question about tax and what the government may or may not do in that context and policies more generally in that context. It is not every day when you are the

He attended a business function, I think in Sydney, and he made this statement. When he was asked a question about whether he would abandon the 2009-10 tax cuts, he said—

                        I withdraw, Mr Speaker. When asked a question about his policy for the 2009 budget and what, when it came to tax, he would do, he said he would have considered cancelling them as part of the mix. This was a question about what we considered or did not consider in the lead-up to the budget and, as I answered before, these matters came forward in that process and they were not adopted.

                          But what we on this side of the House are very serious about is a comprehensive review of our tax system. It goes to the very core of the attractiveness of this country as a place for investment; it goes to the very core of the living standards of every worker in this country. We will not be stopped by those opposite from having a comprehensive review and we are not going to play their silly political games in this House when it comes to something as fundamental as long-term tax reform.
