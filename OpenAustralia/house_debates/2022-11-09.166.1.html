       <p>
        I'm pleased to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022. Australians owe a debt of gratitude to our ADF personnel and veterans. We have a solemn duty to look after them—especially our most disabled veterans, who can't work because of injuries sustained in the service of their country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former Morrison government loved to talk up their defence and national security credentials, and to mouth platitudes to veterans, but the reality is: they completely neglected the ex-service community and their families, and they presided over a crisis in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        . Remember how, despite overwhelming support for a royal commission into defence and veteran suicide, the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, had to be dragged kicking and screaming to establish one last year, after Labor called for one back in 2019? While many struggling veterans waited years for their compensation processes to be dealt with, the former government chronically underfunded and understaffed the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which had a backlog of over 60,000 claims, including many for disabled service pensions. In the words of the former veterans' affairs minister—the member for Calare, no less—their neglect and inaction was nothing less than a national disgrace. It took the former minister threatening to resign over funding shortfalls in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        to prompt the Morrison government to increase resources for claims processing, only to rip away $430 million from the rest of the department's budget, as we discovered after the election in evidence given to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Defence and Veteran Suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's probably no issue that typifies the coalition's arrogance and tin ear when it comes to veterans' issues more than the totally and permanently incapacitated, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
         TPI
        </a>
        , pension. The fact is that the TPI Federation had been raising concerns about the adequacy of the TPI payment for around nine years, but the Liberal-National government completely ignored them. Before the 2019 election, the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, raised expectations that he would increase the TPI payment by committing to a review of the pension and telling the TPI Federation that they had a 'compelling case for greater compensation'. He raised expectations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The TPI review conducted by former senior public servant Mr David Tune would report back after the election. It was really just a cynical marketing exercise to placate veterans and buy votes. Unfortunately, many veterans fell for it. I remember being on a polling booth on election day in 2019 at Raceview State School and hearing veterans say they were going to vote Liberal because
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        was apparently going to fix the TPI issue. Following the election, the TPI Federation revealed they'd had limited consultation with the Tune review. The review met with the TPI Federation only once so they could put their case forward. However, shockingly, it completely dismissed the group's submissions, and they weren't even given a copy of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The review, when completed in August 2019, was buried under the cloak of cabinet in confidence until the delayed October 2020 budget. After sitting on the report for more than a year, the government finally announced that, far from increasing the TPI payment, all they were going to offer was modest rent assistance to about 10 per cent of TPI veterans—around 2,700 people—who were living in private rental accommodation, leaving most TPIs disgusted that they would miss out on any form of increased assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, after raising the TPI Federation's hopes before the 2019 election, the former coalition government went on to dash them after the election. It was another case of bad faith—all announcement, no delivery—and it showed that veterans couldn't trust the coalition at the last election.
       </p>
       <p>
        To add insult to injury, in response to Labor's questions in Senate estimates it was revealed that these benefits were due to start in September 2022, after the election—in two years—to allow for changes to legislation and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        systems. In other words, it would have been years before the people who were acknowledged by the Tune review as being in desperate need of help actually received assistance. Remember that this was only 2,700 veterans. It was only after pressure from Labor and TPI veterans that the start date was brought forward to January 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the former shadow minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel, I took the time to meet with and listen to the concerns of TPI veterans and especially the TPI Federation and their president, Ms Pat McCabe, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thornton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Thornton
        </a>
        , who had undertaken extensive analysis of TPI pension adequacy over the years. I engaged with the Australia Defence Association and Executive Director Neil James, as well as groups like the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, who agreed that there was a good case for an increase in the TPI payment. In response, I resolved to refer this matter to an independent Senate investigation so that TPI veterans could have their say. To that end I worked with Labor senators to establish a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry in March last year to examine the adequacy of the TPI payment. That was ably chaired by the late former Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, who did a fantastic job in that inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee found that submitters, including the TPI Federation, had 'made a persuasive case for a fair and just structural increase in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGR" rel="nofollow">
         AGR
        </a>
        '—the above the general rate—'component of the TPI payment to help restore the relative value of the payment and recognise and replace TPI veterans' loss of income'. The committee recommended a modest increase in the TPI payment and left it up to the government to give further consideration to the exact level of the increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was so interesting in that inquiry was the fact that even the secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cosson" rel="nofollow">
         Liz Cosson
        </a>
        , conceded that the government had raised expectations and that the TPI Federation had made a strong case for an increase in the TPI pension. Ms Kate Pope, a DVA official, did not even attempt to defend the government's position and agreed with the view that compensation for TPI veterans was insufficient. Based on all the submissions and evidence, the committee recommended that the government increase the TPI payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time Labor welcomed this and called on the Morrison government to respond to the committee's unanimous recommendation. Once again the Morrison government dragged their heels and eventually tabled a response on 1 October, completely ignoring the committee's recommendation. It was another slap in the face for TPI veterans. Ironically, some
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        backbenchers had said that this was the most deserving issue in the veteran community, yet their Prime Minister completely ignored them.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's more, late last year the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide heard evidence from the TPI Federation that a lack of support for TPIs had had a terrible impact on their mental health and wellbeing. As the shadow minister I was determined to do the right thing for our disabled veterans, who put their lives on the line for our country, so I was proud to announce before the election that an Albanese Labor government would introduce a permanent $1,000 increase in the annual rate of the special rate of disability pension, or TPI payment, for eligible disabled veterans from 1 January 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a pleasure to work with the TPI Federation in developing this policy, and I'm grateful for their support and the endorsement of Labor's commitment during the election campaign. This bill before the House delivers on that commitment. It is now a budget measure. It will provide a boost of $38.46 per fortnight. This will provide additional financial support to around 27,000 TPI pensioners, at a cost of $97.9 million over four years, to ensure our most disabled and vulnerable veterans are not left behind.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's be clear: the TPI payment is for life, it's tax exempt, it's not means tested and it's not offset by superannuation, but it can be by other compensation assistance. For a person to be a TPI recipient, particularly at above the general rate, they have to have 70 per cent or greater incapacity, have to be aged less than 65 years on making application, have to not be able to work for more eight hours per week due to service related conditions alone and have had to suffer a loss of earnings. These are the most disabled veterans in the country, so Labor is giving them an increase in their payment—something the coalition government refused to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget measures bill today is consistent with the Albanese Labor government's commitment in our first budget to deliver responsible cost-of-living relief. This TPI bonus means the payment is comparable with the national minimum wage and, crucially, greater than the after-tax national minimum wage. I know some people will feel it does not go far enough but there is a lot of pressure on the budget and this increase will help maintain the relative value of the payment over time. The measure will provide extra financial support to TPI veterans and their families on top of regular indexation increases every March and September. The top-up is comparable to a structural increase in the special rate of $50 per fortnight, around 5.75 per cent, separate to regular indexation measures introduced when the coalition government—the Howard government—did listen to veterans in July 2007 and backdated it to March 2007. The then Labor government—the Rudd government—delivered a five per cent, or around $16 per fortnight, increase to the general rate from March 2008, which also flowed through to the special rate. The increase in the TPI payment is due to commence on 1 January 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate and thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Burt, for what he is doing in bringing forward this bill to ensure this can happen. Given the urgency, I'm calling on the opposition and crossbench to do everything they can to facilitate its passage as soon as possible. The coalition has a woeful record in the space in the last nine years. The least they can do is back this in now. After all, as the former Prime Minister, member for Cook said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact that TPI veterans are not able to earn an income as a result of their service to our nation means that their loss of income during what would have been their working life should be appropriately recognised and replaced.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a pity he did not act on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, this extra assistance to TPI veterans comes on top of the government's other measures to ease the cost of living for all Australians, like cheaper medicine and expanding access to the Commonwealth seniors healthcare card, while recognising the special circumstances of TPI veterans and their families face. This TPI boost is just one plank in our strong election and budget package of practical support for veterans with a focus on the cost of living, service delivery, jobs, housing and family support for veterans—not platitudes, not token gestures like dodgy discount schemes and lapel pins. Veterans and their families can have faith they now have a government and a Prime Minister who have their backs, who treat them with the dignity they deserve and who give them financial support. The new Labor government's plan to repair the coalition's decade of damage will restore services veterans and their families can count on to replace neglect with respect and financial support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide is an important opportunity for the government to ensure veterans have better access to the support they deserve. The government is also developing a pathway to implement the royal commission's recommendations to simplify the legal framework for veterans' compensation and rehabilitation, and it's not beyond our will or wisdom to make sure we have a code that covers the VEA, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRCA" rel="nofollow">
         MRCA
        </a>
        and the DRCA legislation. The government is investing $233.9 million over four years to recruit another 500 staff in the DVA to speed up compensation claims processing, something the former coalition government refused to do. We are ending the outsourcing and privatisation of the department. In addition, $87 million over two years will be allocated to improve veterans' access to support services. I am very pleased to see the $46.7 million for 10 veterans and family hubs across the country, including one in my electorate of Blair. The coalition refused to do this by the2019 election, having promised they would do a veterans hub in my electorate in 2016, breaking their promise to the people of Ipswich and surrounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget includes $24 million to develop and deliver a veterans' employment program, which will not only support veterans as they transition into civilian life but champion veterans' employment by raising awareness of the skills and experience veterans have to offer civilian workforces. Too often under the previous government it was about handing out awards to businesses who supported veterans and not enough practical support for veterans on the ground to get into employment. On a similar note, there is $4.7 million for the development of the Operation NAVIGATOR, a smart phone application to better support our ADF personnel as they transition into the civilian workforce, a commitment I was delighted to announce at the Oasis Townsville veterans' hub during the election campaign. One in 10 people who leave the ADF in any given year leave from Townsville, so it's critical that the Oasis be supported, and I'm pleased to see that we are doing so.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is $46.2 million to expand access to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme to boost defence personnel and veterans homeownership, on which I spoke earlier today. It's worth adding that the government plans to set aside $30 million to support veteran homelessness as part of our investments in social and affordable housing as part of the Housing Australia Future Fund. It is a critical issue, and I commend people and, particularly, organisations like those I saw in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and in Queensland who do great work in helping veterans with homelessness and transitioning to housing after leaving the ADF. Finally, the government has committed to working with defence and veterans' families to design a support strategy involving better posting cycles, housing solutions and transition services. This is absolutely crucial in my electorate, where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley is located.
       </p>
       <p>
        This measure in this bill demonstrates the Albanese Labor government's commitment to providing practical support for current and ex-serving personnel. I thank the minister for his continued commitment to veterans and for the budget measures here, which will make a difference in my electorate. I want to make sure that veterans' families in my electorate and around the country get a better future than they had under the previous coalition government.

         I rise to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022. This is the second bill regarding increasing the support that we, the Commonwealth, provide to veterans that I have had the opportunity to speak on this week.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         start by acknowledging all the veterans who serve in this place, in both houses, thanking them for their service and making the comment, as I always do in debates on these types of bills, that it is very helpful that people who have served and are veterans are able to contribute in these debates and give those of us who have not served in uniform their very important perspective, not only their own but that of the networks they are very deeply engaged in through the veterans community.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is poignant that we are debating these matters in a week that culminates in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Remembrance Day
         </a>
         , on Friday. Of course, 11 November is a commemoration link to the armistice at 11am on 11 November 1918, when hostilities ceased on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
          Western Front
         </a>
         . From there came the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" rel="nofollow">
          Treaty of Versailles
         </a>
         and other treaties that ended the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          First World War
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
          Great War
         </a>
         . There was nothing great about it, but historians hoped the magnitude and devastation of that war would lead to such an ingrained lesson to humanity that we would never have a repeat of it. Tragically, that was not to be, given the Great War is now referred to as the First World War.
        </p>
        <p>
         This Friday in our electorates we will all take the opportunity to commemorate, at 11am, the moment that has by extension become a commemoration of sacrifice across all conflicts in this nation and in many nations around the world. For some it is their primary remembrance event. In this country, Anzac Day has at least equal, and potentially greater, significance, given how specific it is to the service of Australian and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealanders
         </a>
         at Gallipoli. Nonetheless, this Friday is certainly one of the very significant commemorations in this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Hughes" rel="nofollow">
          Billy Hughes
         </a>
         said at Versailles that he spoke for 60,000 dead Australians. The magnitude of that loss and sacrifice, given the adult male population of our nation at the time, is absolutely spectacular. People come to this country from around the world, and if you take them out of the cities—our regional members would advocate that people see the real Australia when they get out of cities—there would not be a country town in this nation that does not have a commemoration of some type to boys lost in the First World War.
        </p>
        <p>
         What's so striking and people note is that it's amazing what kind of impact and legacy a war on the other side of the planet left here in continental Australia. That, of course, is the case in the other great nations that engaged in that conflict. I have a suburb called Dernancourt in the north of my electorate, which is named after the Dernancourt village in the north of France, which had a very significant battle in early 1918. It was a battle that was a very significant halting of one of the final German attempts to break through the front before
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         soldiers arrived in support a few months later in 1918 just towards the culmination of that horrendous war.
        </p>
        <p>
         We in the coalition, of course, support this bill, which increases the payments to those in total permanent incapacitation who are veterans and who have served our nation. Obviously we want to take every opportunity to do everything that we should do to support those who have served this nation and give them every support in their lives and careers, both during service and after. This is specific to after service. None could be more deserving than those who are in a situation where they're totally and permanently incapacitated and not in a position to earn the income and have the career that they would have absolutely had if they hadn't made such sacrifices in serving our nation. Obviously supporting increased ways to help them more is something that in the coalition we always look to support the government on. We look to support them on these matters and come up with our own constructive proposals where we see opportunity.

         As local members of parliament, we're very engaged with our veteran communities in a number of ways, such as on the commemoration side and supporting the services clubs that we have in our electorates. I am also very honoured to have the Jamie Larcombe Centre in my electorate, which is one of the Commonwealth funded facilities that provide a number of veterans services to veterans in my electorate but also much more broadly in Adelaide and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . At times as local members we are contacted, and there are times when veterans do need help to navigate and get the support that they're absolutely entitled to. Sometimes, regretfully, the bureaucracy can be slow and can get some of the treatment of our veterans either incorrect or delayed. One of the very important roles of us as members of parliament is to make sure that we're supporting all the people who we represent that are entitled to government services, but particularly our veterans.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'd like to acknowledge all veterans who do so much to become leaders within the veteran community and support their fellow veterans, particularly those who are in need of that support. There's nothing in my experience that's more significant in providing veterans support than another veteran, who, of course, can understand exactly some of the challenges and experiences that they are challenged with or suffering from. Our veterans who take those leadership roles and provide that assistance to their fellow veterans really do need to be acknowledged and commended by all of us. In this debate I want to take that opportunity as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other speakers have talked about the royal commission that is currently underway. Of course, we all eagerly await any recommendations from that process that we might have the opportunity to put in place in this parliament. The government at the executive level, depending on the nature of recommendations, will also have the opportunity to respond to those. There is absolute unanimity around the commitment from all of us in this place that any veteran suicide or serving personnel suicide is one too many. We stand ready as an opposition to work with the government on anything that comes out of that process that recommends ways that the government can do anything at all to prevent a single suicide from those communities. I think it's extremely important to take any opportunity from that process.
        </p>
        <p>
         This increase is welcome, but it does come at a time when the cost of living is obviously growing at a very rapid rate. The people who we're supporting through this measure, this increase, are people who are on a fixed income. Whether they are veterans on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
          TPI
         </a>
         or any other people on support payments—pensioners et cetera—in our society, inflation impacts on them more than anyone. When you're on a fixed income, when you have to very carefully manage the household budget, it is frightening to see prices going up, on average, at 7.3 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The budget and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         are predicting that the inflation rate will be increasing from that point. And, regrettably, around the world at the moment all the predictions being made about inflation by central banks and by governments are continually being revised up. We hope to see inflation falling, but regrettably the pattern at the moment is that it is increasing. Increases like this have to be seen with the lens of the inflation rate applied to them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         At 7.3 per cent, whilst increases to these payments are strongly supported, it is going to be important for this parliament, and this government—at a much more rapid rate than we've been accustomed to in the past—to keep looking at whether or not we're keeping up with those pressures. Hopefully, we'll see those pressures dissipate, and the government has got an opportunity to play a role in that as well and to apply policy measures that can assist with putting downward pressure on inflation. That's the context and the environment that we are in, in debating this bill, but I certainly proudly support it, as do the coalition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once again, I thank all the members who have indicated their support. There is a unanimity around it. I particularly thank the veterans who serve in this parliament who have spoken about the importance of this bill and have also spoken about their own particular experience as veterans. This feeds into how they can contribute to supporting and suggesting ways that we can do more to support our veterans. With those comments, I commend the bill to the chamber.

         <p>
          I'm proud to rise and support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022, which directly responds to recommendations of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Commission
          </a>
          into Defence and Veteran Suicide. It also addresses recommendations of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and it's coming off a lack of action of the previous coalition government. The former Prime Minister raised many hopes amongst veterans, for years promising change, but those hopes were cruelly cut down time and time again. This bill is filling in the gaps and mending the broken trust that ex-service personnel have felt after nine long years of being left behind by the previous government.
         </p>
         <p>
          We're here to change that and are finally legislating on something that should have been acted on before we reached this crisis point. We've consistently shown up for veterans, even when we were in opposition. We've always done what we can. And we will always staunchly back more support for our veterans. It's not just about patriotism, it's actually about getting things done.
         </p>
         <p>
          We instigated an inquiry during the previous government to try and get the now opposition to act for veterans. Despite their coming from bipartisan committee, the government still didn't act on those recommendations. Honestly, I feel sorry for those opposite who are passionate about veterans affairs, because we did work together in the last parliament to try and make substantial change. Yet nothing got done because the leadership couldn't deliver. When the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_committee" rel="nofollow">
           Senate committee
          </a>
          's findings were introduced to the parliament in the middle of last year they were ignored by the previous government. Calls from veterans groups and members of the veterans community were ignored. Calls from within their own party room were ignored by the previous government. The advice that came through from the committee wasn't even that radical. It suggested just a moderate increase, something that could have easily been instigated. There were reports of understaffing and a backlog of claims, something that could have easily been fixed with legislation. But the previous government were just unable to do the job to address this.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now Labor is here, finally delivering on the findings and promises of this inquiry. It was Labor, despite being in opposition, that started the Senate inquiry into veterans affairs, and it will be Labor who finally delivers for the veteran community.
         </p>
         <p>
          We proudly took the policies behind this bill to the election. We know that the previous government were all announcement and no delivery when it came to these things. Labor is here doing the things that matter for those who have served. When those opposite were in office they had the chance to provide better support to veterans. While we welcome their support for the bill now, why did we have to wait so long? That's the question veterans ask.
         </p>
         <p>
          This legislation will increase both the fortnightly payments and the services available to veterans. We are tackling the staffing issues that have led to hundreds of thousands of claims not even being looked at, because of how understaffed the department was before we came to power. Labor is moving quickly with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
           DVA
          </a>
          to make sure it is adequately equipped to help veterans and get through the current backlog. We're doing this through a range of measures. We are investing $233.9 million to hire 500 new staff at DVA to provide more support in getting through claims; committing $24.3 million to provide increased support to veterans who are having their claims processed and to improve future capacity to prepare for when there may be an increase in claims; and committing $15.5 million to support DVA's continued engagement with the royal commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are moving quickly to fulfil our election commitments and we urge the parliament to do the same. The quicker we approve these administrative capabilities, the quicker support will be given to those in the community. The fact that this has taken so long and that these administrative issues have gotten so bad is a real testament to the previous government. When you change the government you change the nation. They had their head in the clouds with no regard to the boots on the ground.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are tackling the effects of the cost-of-living crisis that most veterans are especially vulnerable to and we are giving them support and security. We're committed to doing this by increasing the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
           TPI
          </a>
          payment by an extra $1,000 a year from the beginning of next year. This will mean $38.46 will be added to the fortnightly payment. That is on top of the biannual indexation increases. There will also be an increase to the temporary special rate payment under the VEA.
         </p>
         <p>
          These are promises that we took to the last election. I am proud to stand before you today and say that Labor is delivering these promises. Some of those opposite should take note of how this is done in case they are ever back in government again. Through this bill the Albanese government provides better support for veterans and their families by improving the claims process, simplifying legislation, giving proper financial compensation and providing more overall support for veterans. This will have a massive effect on those who have served and their families. It will help some 27,000 veterans and their families, which is why we are working hard to get this through. The sooner the support comes the better. I think both sides of the House should agree on that.
         </p>
         <p>
          This legislation will have overarching effects on all communities in Australia and throughout all of our electorates. It will provide supports and a boost to all veterans in our communities, which will have only a positive impact. In my electorate of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
           McEwen
          </a>
          this legislation will help some 1,409 DVA clients and 622 people who receive VEA pension benefits. This support to the members of our community who have served this country with exceptional honour and bravery will have huge positive impacts across our community.
         </p>
         <p>
          For a wider look, this legislation will affect some 255,000 veterans Australia-wide. The legislation will help over 86,000 dependants who receive benefits from these schemes. No-one will lose out from this legislation. We just need to get it done. This legislation will provide ex-service personnel with stability and support for them to help reintegrate into civilian life. This is our way of doing what we can to help pay them back.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm very passionate about getting this legislation through as quickly as possible, as I've seen the need for this system to be fixed. The system has been beyond capacity. In another debate yesterday I reflected on working with veterans in the McEwen community. I was contacted by Len. Len is a veteran in our community. He had been waiting over 1,000 days just to have his claim heard—not even approved; just heard. By any stretch of the imagination that's appalling. That is a result of what we had under the Morrison government. Veterans were left behind. It's appalling. It's not what should be happening. I know there are those on opposite who genuinely care and who know that this is a problem. I don't think any of us sitting in this room today would say that it's fair and reasonable, especially to those who have given so much for our community.
         </p>
         <p>
          The DVA has had a real problem with the way it has been working with veterans and how it supports them. Due to a lack of funding to the department and being so understaffed, it just could not get through the claims. He's in the room, and he'll probably get a shock that I'm being nice to him, but when I spoke to Minister Keogh, he made sure that Len's claim was not only assessed but approved within 24 hours. That is what happens when you are proactive. Len said to me on the phone: 'The sad part is it was approved using the same information that I had given DVA 1,000 days ago.' Nothing had changed. It was just that he hadn't been given the opportunity to have his claim looked at, but now, not only was it looked at but it was addressed. The importance of that can never be underestimated. For three years this poor fellow had been under the stress of waiting, not knowing if he was going to get support that was owed to him. He is not alone. He is one of many who go through this situation, and he's one of many who have been suffering because of the backlog of work at DVA.
         </p>
         <p>
          I know that members on both sides want to see that veterans are looked after. We cannot see veterans of today going through the problems that faced Vietnam veterans. We have that lesson to be learned—we know that—and we have to do all we can to fix that. We, as a parliament, make decisions that send young men and women out and sometimes bring them home broken. We have an obligation to do what we can to fix that. It is not a partisan thing. I know the member for Riverina, over there, is passionate about this, and I know he supports the idea that we have—he has Kapooka, so he might have seen the odd soldier come through there daily. He knows what goes on, just as we know what goes on, and we have a job to do. I know that if the parliament works together we can get on with that.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a commitment we have to make to veterans. This legislation will bring some of the change that is sorely needed in the veteran community. I know there are many other veterans who are in a desperate situation. We have to do everything we can to work together to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. When you talk to organisations like Save Our Services you see them doing a great deal of work to help veterans who have got out of the armed services transition to civilian life by getting them jobs in construction, because the one thing that comes through, when you talk to a lot of veterans, is they don't feel valued anymore. Giving them the dignity of employment and support and the help they need is vital in giving these guys opportunity.
         </p>
         <p>
          I've mentioned Save Our Services before, with Jeb in Sunbury, who felt so bad that on Anzac Day he was going to give me back his medal. Nothing turned my stomach more than that. This guy gave everything, came back injured and could not get the support he needed. Fortunately, he didn't go through with it, and I'm grateful he didn't. That's not where our support should end. It's why we should be supporting this bill. We've begun the work, beginning with the hiring process to help get claims through. Let's get this legislated so we can get this job done, because the wait and lack of action have been disappointing for those sitting in parliament—on both sides, as I've said. I know people on that side who are disappointed with what has happened. It's disappointing for us who have a big interest in defence and veterans, but it's even worse for those who have been all but forgotten in the past decade. Together as a parliament, let's do the right thing and get this legislation through for people who have given us so much. I commend the bill to the House.

           … there is only one way out of this war for an infantryman and that is on his back; either sick, wounded or dead. There is no going back to cheering crowds—no marching through the London streets and ovations in Australian ports. They will be put at it to fight and fight and fight again—until, if not in this battle, then in the next each man gets his bullet … They are looking down the long road straight to the end—they can see it plain enough now, and they know that there is no turning.

           just two days away now, we need to look after our people who proudly put on the uniform, not just when they're wearing the uniform, not just when they are marching on 25 April or November 11, but each and every day after the service, just as importantly as when they are in service.
          </p>

           This bill must pass before the end of 2022 to take effect from 1 January,

           </a>
           , next year. I appreciate that the now government, in opposition, made an election commitment to deliver a one-off $1,000 annual increase to recipients of the TPI payment. Approximately 27,000 veterans receive TPI payments. I'm proud to say that in my electorate we have 3,800 veterans, of whom 1,426 reside in Wagga Wagga. The increased payment has been provided for in the recent federal budget that the member for Rankin delivered for 2022-23. The TPI payment is formally called the special rate of disability compensation payment, and it is offered when a veteran's injuries from war or defence service are assessed under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as preventing them from having a normal work life. This is so important because often those people who have served in the military find it difficult to adjust to civilian life, to normal work life, when their military careers have finished. And, just as they placed their lives on the line for us in the service of our nation, we—and especially we here in the parliament—should look after them when that service is done.
          </p>
          <p>
           The TPI payment is paid for life unless circumstances change—for example, if the recipient returns to work. It is not taxable and nor should it be, and it is not included in means-testing for other income support payments. I do hope—and I mean this earnestly and not politically—that the payment is not absorbed by other cost-of-living pressures brought about by increases in electricity and power prices. I hope that that money does give veterans the relief that they've sought, that they need and that they deserve. I appreciate that there are cost-of-living pressures. And those cost-of-living pressures are very much in the minds of any family doing a budget, any business continuing to open its doors and serve customers, and, indeed, any veteran who finds it difficult—as many of them do—to make ends meet from one pay cheque to the next. It's very, very important that we look after our veterans.
          </p>
          <p>
           We as parliamentarians on all sides of the chamber have seen all too often in recent times awful stories—horrible media articles—about veterans sleeping rough, about veterans couch surfing, and about veterans living in cars and under bridges. This is not good enough. It's not good in 2022. It wasn't ever good enough. While I disagree with much of what the member for McEwen said in his contribution about the level of support provided under the former coalition government—of which I was for a long time the Deputy Prime Minister—the member did comment on the need to provide a roof over the heads of our veterans. And I'm pleased that the previous bill, the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Amendment Bill 2022, passed through this chamber earlier today.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm also pleased that the government has brought forward this TPI increase. I appreciate that TPI payments are indexed to male total average weekly earnings and TPI recipients also receive the veteran gold card, as they should. The coalition support the bill. We said at the outset when we returned to opposition that we would support good legislation and that we would support reasonable policy. And, whilst good legislation and policy often comes at a bottom-line expense, this expense is very much warranted, given the fact we are talking about our veterans, and given the fact we are supporting veterans who have supported us. I know how important this is.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I did in my previous contribution, and as the previous speaker, the member for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwan" rel="nofollow">
            McEwan
           </a>
           , did in his contribution, I would like to mention the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Commission
           </a>
           into Defence and Veteran Suicide. This legislation and that for the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme help to give veterans hope. We need to ensure that we give veterans a roof over their heads and the support that they need—whether that's TPI or other payments—as well as, obviously, mental health support and care and love. We need to wrap our arms around them, as so many organisations do—organisations such as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_On" rel="nofollow">
            Soldier On
           </a>
           and the Integrated Service People's Association of Australia et cetera.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to note that the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide is having a public hearing in Wagga Wagga. It will be the eighth public hearing conducted by the royal commission and follows a recent hearing in Darwin. The venue will be the Mercure hotel, 1 Morgan Street, Wagga Wagga. The hearings are set down to be held between 28 November and 2 December. I urge any veteran who wants to be part of that to go onto the net, to contact the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
            DVA
           </a>
           , to see if and how they can take part in that. I appreciate that the royal commission website will be live streaming those particular hearings in Wagga Wagga.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide was established on 8 July 2021 by the coalition government to conduct an inquiry into the over-representation of serving and ex-serving defence members in deaths by suicide in Australia. There are three royal commissioners heading the inquiry: Nick Kaldas
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APM" rel="nofollow">
            APM
           </a>
           , who is the chair, the Hon. James Douglas
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC" rel="nofollow">
            KC
           </a>
           and Dr Peggy Brown AO. I would encourage anyone who has a story to tell to reach out to the royal commission. The commission has so far heard tragic stories, and I would urge anyone distressed by material or images at the Wagga Wagga hearing to seek support or to speak to a member of the inquiry's counselling team. This is so, so important.
          </p>
          <p>
           We heed the words from Charles Bean, who established the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
            Australian War Memorial
           </a>
           after his experience at Pozieres. I appreciate the manner in which the government has brought this particular veterans support to the parliament and the good intentions behind it, and that is why we are supporting it. I'll say again: I do hope that the $1,000 one-off increase will not be eaten up by increased cost-of-living pressures, which, let's face it, there are in the community at the moment. I understand how important this is. I recommend it to the House, and I thank the government for bringing it forward.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I'm on my feet, I also want to wish the member for Burt, the 46th Minister for Veterans' Affairs, all the best in his role. It's an important role. It is one of the most vital and integral roles in the parliament. It should always be in cabinet.

             I'm glad I've got the support of the member for Wills there, because the role is too important not to be in cabinet. The person who is filling this role needs to be around the big decision table when the important decisions are being taken—not for a party's sake but for our veterans' sake. As I say, I wish him well in the role and I offer him every bit of support that I can give, having been a minister for veterans' affairs. I commend this particular bill to the House.

              I thank the member for Riverina for his contribution. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022. The Albanese Labor government is committed to ensuring that veterans who are impacted severely by their experience in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Defence Force
              </a>
              are supported fairly. Our defence personnel, veterans and their families deserve our respect, and they deserve to be well looked after. As our Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel, Mr Keogh, noted in his contribution on this bill—and I note he's sitting just behind me—looking after our veteran community 'is an important task and responsibility of government—a solemn commitment.' As with so many things, it has taken a Labor government to honour this commitment and take the necessary steps to ensure a better future for veterans and their families.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before the 2019 election, the member for Cook, as Prime Minister, raised expectations that he would increase the rate of the disability compensation payment special rate, also known as the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
               TPI
              </a>
              payment, by committing to a review of the pension. He even told the TPI Federation that it had a compelling case. However, after the election, no increase was recommended by that review.
             </p>
             <p>
              In response to this typical 'all announcement, no delivery' behaviour of the previous government, Labor senators took action to get the job done, initiating an inquiry through the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. That committee's report was tabled on 1 July 2021, recommending an increase to the TPI payment and suggesting it should be increased by a modest amount. Disappointingly—but not, perhaps, unsurprisingly—the Morrison government ignored this bipartisan recommendation and in fact did nothing in response to the inquiry for its entire term over 2019 to 2022.
             </p>
             <p>
              This bill is Labor's response to that inquiry and the specific recommendation about increasing the rate of TPI. It implements the Albanese government's 2022 pre-election commitment to provide a $1,000 per annum increase to the TPI from 1 January 2023. This bill shows that the government is listening to the needs of veterans and their families. Specifically, this measure will (1) provide the increase of $1,000 to the annual rate of TPI under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, (2) increase the temporary special rate payment under the VEA and the special rate disability pension under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and (3) ensure that TPI veterans and their families are provided greater financial support, recognising the impact of their ADF service.
             </p>
             <p>
              Importantly, this bill also delivers on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to deliver responsible cost-of-living relief. The increase to the TPI payment means it will be comparable with the national minimum wage and greater than the after-tax national minimum wage that a wage earner would receive. This initiative recognises the importance of supporting veterans who have been severely impacted by their experiences in the Australian Defence Force.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am proud to be part of a government that honours and supports our veterans and serving defence personnel. The recent passage of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022, which supports veterans who are in an approved rehabilitation program and undertaking full-time study to continue to receive incapacity payments at 100 per cent of their normal weekly earnings for an additional year, is just one example of this. Likewise, the introduction during the last sitting week of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Amendment Bill 2022 will boost homeownership for defence members and veterans by expanding the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme eligibility criteria.
             </p>
             <p>
              I must also acknowledge the Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants Program, which provides funding for projects and activities that commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australia's military personnel in wars, conflicts and peacetime operations. The most recent round of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS" rel="nofollow">
               STS
              </a>
              program provided funding for two very worthwhile projects in my electorate, giving funding to the Launceston branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association to install memorial bench seats at Lake Sorell and to the Westbury
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
               RSL
              </a>
              to construct a panorama of wall-mounted commemorative steel silhouettes. I will note here that applications are currently open for an upcoming round of the Saluting Their Service program, and I would encourage ex-service organisations and councils within the electorate of Lyons to consider applying.
             </p>
             <p>
              We all want our service personnel, veterans and veterans' families to know that Australia is proud of them and that our country will always be there for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              One way we are doing this is by implementing the government's response to the
              <i>
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

              , provide increased support to veterans who are having their claims processed and commenced $15.5 million to support DVA's continued and timely engagement with the royal commission. Under this Albanese Labor government, veterans and veterans' families are getting the support that they not only need but deserve, and this bill is one such practical measure that does just that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just before I commend this bill to the House, I'd like to remind the House that in two days we commemorate the service of veterans and those who served in

               this week, we prepare to once again honour those that have served and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We will pause and remember the cost paid by the many that died in the service of our country—them and their families. Our community knows that we must always support our defence forces and their families and the extended communities around them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Today I am pleased to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022, an important amendment, particularly for those who have served and suffered either physical or mental health consequences as a result of their service. As a government we recognise that these injuries have consequences to their lives outside of the Defence Force. Those who have suffered disability because of injuries while serving in the defence forces our entitled to a higher rate of pension to reflect the person's inability to work due to these injuries.
              </p>

               This amendment seeks to provide a modest recognition of those that wear the scars of their service. It's honouring an election commitment made by Labor to permanently increase the totally and permanently incapacitated payment for eligible disabled veterans. The commitment was made by Labor after the previous government failed to act on the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The committee, at Labor's insistence, conducted an inquiry during the last parliament into the totally and permanently incapacitated payment, and recommendation No. 1 was for a modest increase to that payment. This amendment honours Labor's commitment to act on the recommendation and will, from 1 January 2023, make an annual increase of a thousand dollars to the

               payment. This increase will go some way to address the decline in the relative value of the payment over time, and it will help ensure that our TPI veterans and their families are provided greater financial support, recognising the impacts of their ADF service.

               This is not the only measure that the Albanese government is taking to improve the welfare of veterans and their families. We've already moved to employ additional staff at the

               </a>
               to address the disgraceful backlog of claims which was allowed to develop under the previous government. In addition, the departmental staffing cap, which has prevented the

               from increasing the number of well-trained and permanent staff, will be abolished. I've been shocked and saddened by stories of veterans in my electorate who have had their claims delayed, who have had to make multiple claims, who have had to tell their stories multiple times, and the suffering that has caused them and their families whilst they wait for their claim to be dealt with. It's bewildering that we can hear those stories from people who have served our nation, whilst they wait for answers—and that might continue for some time. Our government's commitment to improve claim-processing times is of vital importance in showing our respect and commitment to those who've served.

               The Albanese government has also committed to opening a network of veterans hubs across Australia, located in areas with significant defence and veteran communities, and I am beyond proud that Queanbeyan, in my electorate, will host one of the veterans wellbeing hubs. It has one of the largest communities of both serving and retired members of the Australian defence forces.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've seen the anticipation of the veterans community for these hubs. I've held round tables, and I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for coming along to one of those round tables in Queanbeyan and speaking to both contemporary veterans and those who have served in conflicts well past. The fact that we have a veterans' affairs minister who's prepared to talk to people on the ground about what will work and what we know won't work in our community is refreshing. These wellbeing hubs will be a one-stop shop for health and mental health services, for wellbeing support, for advocacy services, for employment and housing services, and for the all-important social connections that this initiative promises.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've heard, time and time again, from veterans in my community, that sometimes the social connections are the things that matter most, and I want to give a shout-out to the Veterans Motorcycle Club, which has its clubhouse in Queanbeyan. It's a fantastic organisation that does just that—provides social connection to former serving personnel and their families. It's something that doesn't mean that they have to talk about what's happened; it's somewhere where they can connect over the issues they were having with DVA; it's somewhere where people can come together just for a laugh and know that they've got a shared history and connection.
              </p>
              <p>
               Other initiatives that are being developed by the Albanese Labor government for the veterans community are housing and employment programs and increasing levels of support for defence families. We know that defence families play a crucial role in getting our veterans integrated back into communities, but they also play a significant role for serving members of the Defence Force. And, so often, those families have to be home alone, without their loved one, as they serve in the Defence Force, whether here or abroad.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are committed to continuing to meet the challenges being investigated by the

               into Defence and Veteran Suicide. This measure demonstrates that the government is listening to the needs of veterans and their families.
              </p>
              <p>
               I commend the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022 to the House. Those who serve and permanently suffer from injuries resulting from their service deserve our deepest respect and continuing gratitude and the modest recognition that this measure provides.

                The Australian community has a clear expectation that defence personnel, veterans and families are well looked after. This is an important task and responsibility of government—a solemn commitment.

               <p>
                In summing up the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022, I'd like to thank the opposition and the others in this House for their support of it. I would like, in particular, to note the great work of the member for Blair, as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel, in developing this commitment from Labor—in supporting the increase of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
                 TPI
                </a>
                payment for our veterans. The member for Blair also noted the great work that we're doing in delivering on veterans hubs—in particular, one in his electorate, in Ipswich, where the previous government committed in 2016 to deliver such a hub which was never ever delivered. Of course, in his electorate, he has a great number of serving personnel and veterans, because of the location there of the Amberley air base, which I was very happy to be able to visit just a few weeks ago.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd also like to thank the member for Sturt, the member for

                , the member for Riverina, the member for Lyons and the member for Eden-Monaro for their contributions in this debate and, in particular, for recognising their local service personnel and veterans communities and for the close work that they have done with their veterans communities, in engaging with them and understanding the special need for service and support that our veterans have. Ensuring that they get that support is what this bill does, in delivering a $1,000 increase to the rate of the TPI pension.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the interests of time, I will make just a few brief remarks. This increase comes from an election commitment by Labor at the last election, but it comes on the back of a commitment from the previous government, in the lead-up to the 2019 election, to look at the rate of payment in support of our TPI veterans, our totally and permanently incapacitated veterans. In their commitment to review, the previous government did nothing. A Senate inquiry then ensued during the last parliamentary term. That Senate inquiry, on a bipartisan basis, recommended that the rate of payment for our TPI veterans be increased. But, again, the previous government did nothing. It fell upon Labor to make a commitment at the last election to make that $1,000 a year increase to TPI payments. Today, with this bill, we are delivering on that commitment.
               </p>
               <p>
                That $1,000 a year increase to the special rate of disability pension, an increase of $38.46 per fortnight, will ensure veterans and their families are better supported financially, which does indeed help keep up with the cost-of-living pressures that they are experiencing. It forms part of our recent budget, which is delivering on our commitment of responsible cost-of-living relief. The increase to the TPI payment means that it will now be comparable with the national minimum wage and, crucially, greater than the after-tax national minimum wage that a wage earner would ordinarily receive. This initiative recognises the importance of supporting veterans who have been severely impacted from their experience in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Defence Force
                </a>
                . The bill will achieve that by amending the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It will support these pensioners.
               </p>
               <p>
                We are committed to implementing this and other practical support measures to better support our defence serving personnel, veterans and families. Of course, it is crucial that this bill pass the House this year to ensure these increases and payments can flow from 1 January 2023. I look forward to the opposition's and other members' support in the Senate to ensure that that can occur. We on this side are committed to delivering a better future for defence personnel, veterans and families. This bill is part of how we are delivering on that in government. I commend the bill to the House.
