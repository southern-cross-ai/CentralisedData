       <p>
        Protecting our ports and airports is a very serious issue. We do take that matter very seriously. I think that was demonstrated by our actions in government as well. These Labor amendments will make the Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill 2019 better, protecting our nation's security at the same time as facilitating Australia's essential workers. It's important that our ports and our workers are still able to operate.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Labor senators identified in their report to the Senate, this bill fails to define 'serious crime' and instead relies on delegated legislation with minimal parliamentary oversight. Labor welcomes the government's indication that they plan to include in the regulations a tiered scheme of crimes in an attempt to get the balance right between protecting our national security and not wrongly excluding a worker from their work. Without having seen those regulations, it is very difficult to determine whether they do in fact do what we think they should do. Labor has repeatedly asked the government to define 'serious crime' and to introduce a definition into the legislation, but the government has consistently said that it won't do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        While not seeking to prevent the government from introducing their proposed tiered scheme, Labor seeks to amend this legislation to ensure that minor crimes are not included in the regulations by the government. The amendments will define 'serious crime' as a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least three years, which is consistent with the definition of 'serious crime' in the citizenship cessation bill currently before the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor will also amend the legislation to include processing time frames for ASICs and MSICs and a legislated avenue of appeal for the hardworking men and women of our ports and airports who have kept this country going. Every time they apply for an ASIC or MSIC or seek to renew their cards they are constantly worried that they will be rejected or that they will be left waiting for their card to be issued. A quarter of a million Australian workers currently hold an ASIC or MSIC. These Australians deserve a system that treats them with respect and allows them to do their job while also protecting our national security. Too often Australian workers at our ports can't go to work because of long processing delays with their cards.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposed expansion of ASICs and MSICs is symptomatic of a government that has not fully understood or taken responsibility for those long processing delays and the impact that that has on the hardworking men and women at our Australian ports and airports who have done nothing wrong. This is why Labor will amend the legislation to ensure that the obligatory processing time frame of 60 days is strictly adhered to by the government when issuing an ASIC or MSIC.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, Labor will ensure that there is a legislative avenue of appeal for those who have been determined to have an adverse security status. People deserve to know why they cannot get that job. Workers' rights have been consistently undercut by this government, and moving the right to appeal from regulations to legislation is recommended by the respected Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and of course is the right thing to do for those hardworking Australian men and women. As I said, these amendments I've moved will improve the bill and, we think, get the balance right between ensuring that we treat the issue of serious crime seriously in this bill and ensure that our ports and airports are secure, and making sure that we are not putting unnecessary impediments in the way of those hardworking men and women at our Australian ports and airports who have kept this country moving. They have done nothing wrong and are subject to delays or, in fact, because there's not a definition of 'serious crime' contained in this bill, are punished in a way that, frankly, is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut on some occasions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend those amendments to the House.

           Labor won't be supporting these amendments. Under the government's amendments, workers will lose their right to work on the basis of intelligence rather than of conviction. This is exactly the issue that we've raised—why there's no definition of 'serious crime' in this bill. But now the government's in fact expanding that. So, rather than a conviction, it will be based on intelligence, which will see applicants denied natural justice, with their employment put at stake by what could be baseless accusations and with limited grounds of appeal. Let's be clear that this could mean that a worker could be denied entry into their workplace based on a rumour alone. A worker could lose their job based on some gossip. A worker could lose their livelihood based on a colleague lying about them to get even at their workplace. Is this really what the Prime Minister means when he says that they're for workers, when their jobs could be snatched away by rumour, gossip and innuendo?
          </p>
          <p>
           Police and criminal intelligence authorities already have significant powers to investigate and prosecute offenders for serious crime, and this legislation should not be used as a quasi-tool to penalise workers by removing aviation and waterside workers' rights to work simply on the basis of intelligence alone. Labor will not be supporting these amendments.
