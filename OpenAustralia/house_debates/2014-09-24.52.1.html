        I recently had the honour of attending the Nexus Primary Health and Mitchell Community Resources and Advocacy Group
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debutante_Ball" rel="nofollow">
         Debutante Ball
        </a>
        for All 2014. The Debutante Ball for All is an inclusive event for people who have not previously been able to participate in a debutante ball as a result of various barriers to participation, such as impaired ability or social disadvantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the debutantes looked magnificent and beautiful, and their partners were very dapper in their tuxedos. The debutantes were officially presented to me, the state member and the

        mayor, Councillor Rodney Parker. Our flower girl for the evening was Kirsten, a bright and bubbly young lady who, with her mum, Catherine, worked with us a couple of years ago to help establish the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Mitchell Shire.
       </p>
       <p>
        The large crowd of family members and friends were beaming with pride as the debutantes lit up the dance floor throughout the evening, led by the effervescent Rupert, who certainly knows how to cut a rug. He could give a few of those on

        a run for their money! The event was a roaring success and allowed members of our community to partake in all the glitz, glamour and excitement of a deb ball and enjoy their time with family and friends.

        College in Seymour was a wonderful setting for the event, and I wish to thank St Mary's for helping put on such a great party. I would like to congratulate and thank everyone involved in organising the event, especially
