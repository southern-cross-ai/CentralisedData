        I rise to pay tribute to the Bahtabah Local Aboriginal Land Council for the fantastic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">
         NAIDOC
        </a>
        Day celebrations they organised in Eastlake Macquarie on the foreshore of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a fantastic day. It commenced with a flag-raising ceremony at the Bahtabah Land Council. It was a privilege to meet the

        's mother was present at that ceremony. The day itself was a fantastic success. The previous year, over 4,000 people had visited the celebrations on the foreshore. This year, I would have to say that there were probably double that number of people that visited and became engaged in the activities at the foreshore.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were activities such as face painting, there was entertainment and a free barbecue for everyone. There were a number of information stalls and interactive activities: Wollotuka, New South Wales Fair Trading, the

        was there, Northcott, Wombat Stories, and a number of other organisations. There was a breastfeeding tent and kids carnival show bags; the Cancer Council was there, as well as the Centre for Hope and

        , and there was an Elders' tent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the day people interacted. My three grandchildren attended the Day in the Park. They are young Indigenous children that actually live in Canberra. They had a fantastic day, along with other non-Aboriginal children. There was a spirit of coming together, joining and enjoying the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I really want to pay tribute to Mick Green. He is a fantastic CEO of Bahtabah Land Council. He has shown leadership at all levels and he has my absolute utmost respect. Congratulations to Bahtabah Land Council for yet another successful day.
