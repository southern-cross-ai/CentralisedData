         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and also for his ongoing commitment to the interests of the people of

         </a>
         , along with, I might say, the member for Kennedy, the member for Lindsay and many others. Before I indicate to the House a number of changes that the government has announced and enhancements to the level of assistance, I would like to again place on record the gratitude of the government, and I know of the nation, to all of those people, including the men and women of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         , the Queensland police and emergency services and the wonderful officers of Centrelink. The Minister for Human Services visited the area yesterday. The Centrelink people have done an absolutely superb job. I would not want any expressions of thanks not to include them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has decided—as I foreshadowed could well be the case when I made the original announcements in Innisfail last Wednesday week—on a number of enhancements which will meet need, and I believe they are very appropriate. In relation to the tax-free ex gratia payment to businesses, including farmers, the government has decided on two changes. The first is that we are going to remove the 20 full-time employee cap. In other words, these ex gratia payments will be available to businesses employing any number of employees, because there are a number of cases—albeit not a large number—where the 20 full-time employee equivalent cap worked to a disadvantage. We have also decided that if significant loss or damage above the normal can be demonstrated we will be willing, in those circumstances, to increase the payment from $10,000 to $25,000 to provide for additional assistance. But there will need to be a demonstration of that significant loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can also inform the House that in response to a number of representations, including from the honourable member, to increase the level of the concessional loan to businesses and farmers from the existing cap of $200,000, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Premier
         </a>
         and I have agreed that under the natural disaster relief arrangements we will now provide concessional loans of up to $500,000 where a need can be demonstrated. The cap on the grant component of $50,000 will be retained and the moratorium on all repayments in the first two years will remain on loans of up to $500,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have also agreed with the Premier that under the natural disaster relief arrangements we will extend assistance to primary producers who have hired generators necessary to keep animal stock alive and healthy, such as dairy cattle which will die if not milked regularly, and aquaculture producers who need to maintain pumps and filters for the health of fish stocks. We will reimburse the costs of generator hire in those circumstances. This is in addition to reimbursement of excise on fuel used by businesses, farmers and households for power generators to produce electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has under continuing consideration some proposals in relation to employment subsidies. The request has been designed to prevent an exit of employees from the area. The Queensland Premier will be in Canberra on Monday in connection with the visit to Australia of the Premier of China. I hope to see him briefly on Monday afternoon to discuss other aspects of the disaster relief operations. I again record the fact that there has been total cooperation between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. I thank the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of Queensland
         </a>
         for that and I thank the officers of his department and mine for the professional way in which they have worked together.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also mention, for the information of the House, that so far 2,700 claims have been made for the $1,000 for adults, $400 for children ex gratia assistance, 560 claims for the $10,000 ex gratia reestablishment of grant, 250 claims for the fuel excise grant and 170 claims for income support payments to businesses and farmers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Could I also, for the benefit of the House, acknowledge that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Glenda" rel="nofollow">
          Cyclone Glenda
         </a>
         , which is off the coast of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , is being very closely monitored. It has reached the level of a category 4 cyclone. It is currently 200 to 300 kilometres from the coast and may make landfall tonight. WA agencies have begun evacuating coastal towns and I would encourage people living in the area likely to be affected to closely and speedily follow all removal and evacuation requests from authorities.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         , under the control of the Attorney-General, is in regular contact with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         emergency management authority about the progress of Cyclone Glenda. It goes without saying that the government, in cooperation with the government of Western Australia, will provide all appropriate assistance, if needed, if the cyclone causes damage to life, limb or property.
