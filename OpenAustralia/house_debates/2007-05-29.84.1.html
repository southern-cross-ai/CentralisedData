       <p>
        I rise to talk about the very important issue of crime. Like many local residents, I have had enough of local crime, hoons, vandals and graffiti. Tackling this problem is extremely important to me. Earlier this month I started a crime petition. Hundreds of people have since signed this petition, many contacting me personally to say how angry and fed up they are at feeling unsafe in their own homes and unsafe when they are out on local streets.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is simply not good enough that the state Labor government is failing in its responsibility to ensure our community is adequately protected. I think it is a basic human right to feel safe when you are in your own home or walking around your local neighbourhood. This petition is part of a wide range of projects that I am involved in which are aimed at trying to prevent criminal activity. Since 2004 the Stirling community has secured funding of around $600,000, through the National Community Crime Prevention Program, for local projects that will make our community safer. One of these projects is now underway. We are looking at getting some further funding in conjunction with the

        and the owners of the Nollamara shopping centre to install a

        Before we were interrupted I was talking about the Nollamarra shopping centre in my electorate, which is a small group of shops filled with very hardworking small business people. Sadly, they have a very serious problem with security. We have been working with the shop owners and with the City of Stirling to see if it is possible to install a CCTV network there. During my visits to the Nollamarra shopping centre in recent months, I have been greatly disturbed by the first-hand accounts from shop owners, staff and shoppers regarding the incidents of serious crime and antisocial behaviour that have been happening there on a weekly basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apart from the burglaries, vandalism, threats of violence and rubbish dumping that have been reported to me, there was even a recent axe attack on a man who was using one of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
         ATM
        </a>
        machines at the centre at about nine o’clock one evening. It was totally unprovoked; he was just standing there using the machine. Somebody came up behind him and assaulted him with an axe. This attack not only resulted in his serious injury but dramatically increased the fear of crime in the area, especially amongst young families and, of course, amongst the elderly. One of the pharmacies has been repeatedly burgled, and its staff fear to walk to their cars in the evening after the shop has closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the City of Stirling for joining me in working towards getting funding from the National Community Crime Prevention Program for a CCTV camera network for this small neighbourhood shopping centre. CCTV cameras are well known to be highly successful deterrents to crime, and I will be lobbying very hard for the government to fund this very worthwhile initiative.
