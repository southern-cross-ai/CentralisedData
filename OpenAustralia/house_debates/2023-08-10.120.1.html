        I'm delighted to speak on behalf of local residents in Officer and thank the Officer Football Club, otherwise known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROC" rel="nofollow">
         ROC
        </a>
        . I was at the opening of their new facility—actually, not the official opening, but the sponsor's day a few weekends back. It was absolutely fantastic to see the new social rooms. Officer is one of the fastest-growing suburbs in the entire country. In actual fact, the club has 26 junior sides, which is rather incredible. These new social rooms will be used by not only the club but also the local community and the netball club. There are a few people I'd like to thank—the president, Lachlan Balzary; the treasurer, Gavin Hooper; and the entire Officer Football Club—for inviting me to this important event. I'd also like to thank all the sponsors, the lifetime members and those who made this incredible event happen.

        I was very honoured to commit, back in 2016, $500,000. When we found out it needed another $500,000, I recommitted in 2019—so it ended up being $1 million. The reason it's so important for governments to support local football clubs—and I go to local Gareth Shean. Gareth contacted me pretty much every day between 2016 and 2019 about the struggles of the club, the growth of the club and how they needed support. Now I'll come to two incredible people, Rob and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Porter" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who I've known for over 20 years. Rob Porter, every single week, pretty much goes out and mows the lawns of the football club. Recently, Rob was in hospital, and we're so glad he's got out. But I can't go without mentioning Rob and thanking him so much for the incredible efforts and support he's given the Officer community for so many years—and the same with Carol Porter. Carol Porter was instrumental in bringing to my attention the need for upgrades to the Officer Netball Club. We previously provided funding to make sure the female players had club rooms and state-of-the-art courts.

        Even the Officer Memorial Gates, which we opened back in 2015—we actually had to move the gates, the beautiful stone gates down there on the corner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        . People like Rob and Carol Porter and Gareth are the backbone of local communities. On behalf of the local community but also all members of parliament—they would agree—I thank them so much for all the great work they've done for so many years for the Officer community. They've both had bad medical conditions recently, and we wish them the best in their future.
