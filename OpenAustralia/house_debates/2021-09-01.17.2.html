         The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is proposing to construct a new national collections building as well as minor alterations to the existing herbarium building at its Black Mountain Science and Innovation Park site in Canberra. The works will enable CSIRO to develop a collections precinct that will accommodate the 13 million specimens comprising Australia's national research collections. These collections represent significant research infrastructure and underpin research in a range of fields, including agriculture, biosecurity, biodiversity and climate change. The works will provide fit-for-purpose specimen storage vaults, research laboratories, curation facilities and office workspace. The estimated cost of the works is $70 million, excluding
