        's great characters and wonderful people in Roger Edwards. In 1941 Roger was drafted into the Australian 10th

        Regiment. Servicemen were asked to take their horse, if possible, and this was no issue for Roger, who lived on a farm in the South West. He served between 1941 and 1944 before being discharged on 23 November 1943.

       <p>
        To commemorate the 50 years since the first regimental camp was held a plaque was unveiled in 1991 by the Bunbury mayor at Hands Oval. This was followed in 2013 by the installation at the Brunswick Memorial Hall of artwork commemorating the 10th Light Horse.

        After his discharge Roger returned to work on his father's farm at Waterloo, growing beef, pigs, potatoes and pumpkins and making cream. He later started his own farm at Waterloo. He married Mona Chergwin and built their house. He retired from farming in 1967 and moved into his home of many years in Wellesley near

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to serving the country Roger made an enormous contribution as a bushfire control officer, a member of the Brunswick agricultural society and a member of the Bunbury camera club. He published a book in 1993 on the Australian light horse. Sincere condolences to all three of his children, particularly his son, Lyndon, who was a tower of strength and the light of his life.
