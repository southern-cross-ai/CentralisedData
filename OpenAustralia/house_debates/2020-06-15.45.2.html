       <p>
        I rise to inform the House that Liverpool council's chief executive officer Kiersten Fishburn has resigned as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of council. Whilst I've spoken before in this place about the circumstances she recently faced, today I will focus on the positive influence her leadership has brought to Liverpool. It has been my pleasure to have worked closely with Kiersten over eight years. Her passion, dedication, energy and enthusiasm for everything and everyone in Liverpool and our community has always been evident. Her leadership has been exemplary and ended a tumultuous era where industrial relations issues plagued council,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
         ICAC
        </a>
        raids were common and the council had four CEOs in eight years and, unfortunately, a regular presence of police at council meetings.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has implemented a positive program for change for council and the community. The Liverpool CBD is thriving with all sides of businesses working together, and is considered the place to be with three university campuses and corporate headquarters in the city.
       </p>
       <p>
        While her leadership successes are too many to include here, plans for the Liverpool Innovation Precinct and Fifteenth Avenue transit are among them. Ms Fishburn has done extensive work in our area and she will be sorely missed. On a personal note, I will miss Kiersten's intelligence and enthusiasm. I know she will succeed in her new role and have Liverpool in her heart.
