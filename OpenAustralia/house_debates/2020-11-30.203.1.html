       <p>
        I stand today to call on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        and its councillors to listen to residents of Curlewis, who are expressing grave safety concerns about a recently built local road, Tivoli Drive. This is a long, straight undulating road with several blind spots. Large trucks travel both ways to get to new developments, and horns are blasted as cars must pull over because the road is too narrow to cope with parked vehicles. It is noisy, it is dangerous and something needs to be done now. Many constituents have reached out to me and labelled the road as a dangerous horror. I have written to councillors and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        requesting action.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of my constituents Merv Finger said the increased traffic, incessant noise and lack of safety have become a nightmare for residents. I urge the council to listen to these residents and to resolve this serious safety issue as soon as possible. I do acknowledge that the City of Greater Geelong has reduced the speed limit to 50 kilometres an hour, and speed bumps are set to be built in December but this is plainly not enough. My constituents say this is an accident waiting to happen, but the city says the road won't be widened for another five years. Five years is unacceptable; the current plan is unacceptable. The community cannot wait any longer, and many residents are selling up. I will continue to stand with local residents and urge the council to take immediate action.
