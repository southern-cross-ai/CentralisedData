        I rise to note the passing of Stephen ‘Alf’ Randell
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        and pay tribute to his extraordinary work in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community. Alf was born in 1923 and spent his first years in the Hunter region. In November 1941, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the Army and within a month was sailing to Malaya. He was taken prisoner in February 1942 and spent more than three years in some of the most infamous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW" rel="nofollow">
         POW
        </a>
        camps, including Changi in Singapore and the forced labour march along the Burma railway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having survived these incredible trials, Alf returned to Australia and married Billie, who remained his wife until her passing in 2002. Both Alf and Billie were well regarded and popular identities in the St Marys area. Alf was a founding member of the local institutions of the St Marys
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , the St Marys Band Club and the Henry Lawson Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alf had a passion for the arts, teaching pottery and leatherwork at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys_School" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys School
        </a>
        of Arts, with special classes for people with a disability. Alf and Billie founded the St Marys Spring Festival, which in 2010 will celebrate its 35th anniversary. It is a celebration of the creative talent of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1992 Alf received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his work in St Marys. He was also a life member of the Labor Party. Alf is survived by his three sisters: Alma, Joan and Josephine. Alf Randell was a great Australian who gave much of his life to his country and his community.
