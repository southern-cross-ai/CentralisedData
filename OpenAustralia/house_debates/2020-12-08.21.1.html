       <p>
        There are many things that I enjoy doing in my role as a local member of parliament but none more than my annual Christmas lunch with the residents of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Island" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It's that one event that, rain, hail or shine, I never miss. Star of the Sea Elders Village is very close to my heart, and I'm very proud to say that I had a role in ensuring that it is what it is today. Its residents are some of the most amazing, inspirational and beautiful people that I've had the pleasure of meeting.

        of the Sea Elders Village lunch is always a joyous and memorable event, and, boy, do we have some fun when the soft drinks start to flow! I cannot confirm or deny the scurrilous rumours claiming that I get dressed up as Santa or one of his elves for the occasion! But, jokes aside, these events have been made possible each year due to the generosity of Chris and Leigh Lemke from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
         Grand Hotel
        </a>
        on Thursday Island. Chris and Leigh have been real heroes in ensuring that this event, now in its sixth year, is possible and that Christmas cheer is extended to some of the community's most vulnerable. Unfortunately this year, the year of COVID, it will be held in the elders village itself, but they will continue to host this as a regular event at their hotel and ensure that the chefs cook up a good mean Christmas lunch with all the trimmings that the residents can enjoy. I want to take the opportunity to publicly thank Chris and Leigh for their amazing generosity. I'm certainly looking forward to a great Christmas lunch with the Star of the Sea residents later next week.
