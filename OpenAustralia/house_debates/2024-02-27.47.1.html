       <p>
        My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services. I refer the minister to his response in the House yesterday where he asserted that, as a result of the government's new family car and ute tax, the Australian people are going to have access to cheaper fuels. Can the minister explain the government's plan to reduce the price of a litre of petrol?

         I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. It's quite clear from this question, from the position that they have adopted on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
          RBA
         </a>
         and, in fact, from their entire record when they were in government that the Leader of the Opposition has adopted drongo economics. What is quite clear from the policy that has been announced by our minister is that we want Australian motorists to have the same benefits that motorists in the United States, in the United Kingdom, throughout Europe and, in fact, in the majority of countries around the world have. That is access to better fuel efficiency standards in their motor vehicles. What that means is that, when they pull out of the petrol station, they know that every litre of fuel is going to go further because they have the most efficient fuel standards in their vehicles in the world. The member for Hume may want Australian motorists to pay more for every kilometre that they travel, but we on this side do not.
