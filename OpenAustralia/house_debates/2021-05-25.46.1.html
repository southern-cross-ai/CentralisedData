        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the Morrison-

          I thank the member for Lyne for his very well asked question. He knows full well the benefits of our $110 billion decade-long pipeline of investment in infrastructure, particularly for the regions, supporting 100,000 workers right across our great country, a country that we on this side talk up regularly, often, always, because that's what we do and it's a great country. In the member for Lyne's electorate, the four councils under the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program are benefitting through $27.4 million of worthwhile investment. Also in Lyne, $60 million is committed with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          government for the construction of a full-grade separated interchange for the Harrington Road and Pacific Road intersection upgrade at Coopernook. I know that that's an important project that has been fought for and advocated for by the member for Lyne, and is now being delivered. It's creating jobs and it's creating opportunities.
         </p>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Airport" rel="nofollow">
           Newcastle Airport
          </a>
          services communities in the member for Lyne's electorate and the electorates of other members, and it is the beneficiary of a $66.1 million upgrade. It's an important infrastructure upgrade: it's important for tourism and it's important for Defence, as the Minister for Defence well knows. The upgrade to the Newcastle Airport is going to widen the runway to allow longer-range domestic and international aircraft, such as Boeing 777s and Airbus 330s, to operate. It is estimated these improvements could create around 4,400 full-time jobs, deliver an additional 850,000 visitors to the region and add $12.7 billion to the local economy over the next two decades. Newcastle lord mayor Nuatali Nelmes said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … the airport would play a key role in the city's transformation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          …   …   …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This breakthrough redevelopment of Newcastle Airport's runway will bring the rest of the world closer to Newcastle, which means more jobs, more economic growth and more opportunities to showcase our region on an international stage.
         </p>
         <p>
          The chief executive of the Newcastle Airport, Dr Peter Cock, said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … the upgrade was a game changer …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          …   …   …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          From local tourism operators and hospitality owners to agricultural producers and freight and logistics providers, this project will drive significant jobs and economic return for generations to come.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm asked whether there are any alternative approaches. I'm happy to say there are not. Another local from Newcastle—to be precise, the member for Newcastle—said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This upgrade is good news for jobs and it will deliver huge economic benefits to our region through international airfreight, expansion of industry and increased tourism traffic over the next two decades.

          The member for Paterson, commenting in the

          She went on and on. Those members both know it happened under a Liberal-National government.
