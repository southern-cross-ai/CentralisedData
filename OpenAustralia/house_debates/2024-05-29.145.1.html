       <p>
        In my electorate of Tangney, a vibrant and diverse community, the high cost of living continues to put pressure on families. Amidst these challenges, however, the Albanese Labor government's budget is easing this burden across Tangney. The Albanese Labor government's tax cuts will deliver lower taxes to every taxpayer in Tangney. On average, Tangney residents will pay $1,818 less per year. Tangney residents earn more and keep more of what they earn.

       <p>
        Easing tax cuts are far from the only thing we are doing to ease the cost of living. Tangney is home to

        . We count many university students and graduates as an important part of our diverse community. I know the value of higher education and how it can set up a prosperous life and career. That is why I'm thrilled that the Albanese Labor government are making sure that

        does not grow more than wages and backdating these changes to last year. In Tangney, 22,340 people will see their HECS debt wiped by at least $1,200 under these changes, providing much needed relief.

        Over the last few months, I have received hundreds of emails from constituents about affordable and accessible health care. Our government is investing $2.6 billion in protecting and strengthening Medicare and keeping the price of medicine affordable. Tangney residents have saved more than $2.6 million on their medication. In the last year, residents of Tangney accessed pathology services 219,366 times. Our government is making sure that these tests stay affordable and accessible by indexing the Medicare rebates for common medical tests, reducing wait times, catching health problems sooner and ensuring common tests stay bulk-billed.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">

        scans are also so important for doctors to be able to detect and diagnose conditions like cancer, but the costs of these tests can be so high that they are out of reach for many. That is why I am proud that we are bringing five MRI machines in Tangney under Medicare coverage, expanding affordable access to crucial radiology services. Our budget is not just about providing temporary relief; It lays a foundation for long-term prosperity and wellbeing for all Australians.
