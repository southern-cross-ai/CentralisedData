        to move:

       <p>
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Football Queensland
        </a>
        licensing scheme is anti-competitive because it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) excludes smaller and new apparel manufacturers who cannot afford to pay the annual fee from the market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) increases costs for clubs and players as licensed suppliers pass on the cost of the licence fee and the 'Q Logo' to consumers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) forces clubs to purchase what some regard as inferior and expensive products as Football Queensland strictly enforces penalties against clubs that wear apparel from non-licensed suppliers in competitive matches;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) increases cost for regional clubs as manufacturers large enough to pay the licensing fee are based in the large population centres, not in the regions; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) protects licensed suppliers from true competition as there is only a limited number of licensed suppliers and most are aware of each others prices;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that the current immunity from prosecution granted to Football Queensland by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        ) has been instrumental in allowing Football Queensland to conduct this anti-competitive behaviour and sets a precedent for other sporting administration bodies within Australia to instigate similar schemes;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the ACCC to consider the anti-competitive nature of the Football Queensland licensing scheme when deciding on the continuation of the immunity from prosecution granted to Football Queensland; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges that Football Queensland and other similar organisations have special exemptions and conditions in relation to their status in their community and as a consequence also carry special responsibility and duty of care in the exercise of its charter for clubs and players, as well as its commercial relationships.
