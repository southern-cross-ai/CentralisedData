        Pathways College, in my electorate of Fisher, is an Australian leader in delivering residential training courses in life skills and independent living for people with intellectual disabilities. I recently had the honour of speaking at the college's graduation ceremony, where I met this year's terrific graduates, Alana, Alex, Clare, Kate-Lyn, Mel, Mitch and Sonia. Having completed their studies, all of these impressive young people are ready to build a new life for themselves and to make their own contributions to our community. On behalf of all members, I say congratulations and all the best for your independent futures.

        One of the many admirable things about STEPS is the way in which they embody their values of independence and self-sufficiency. The week after graduation, staff and students alike were out on the road on the Steps for STEPS fundraising walk along the length of our coastal strip. I met up with walkers at the stadium to make my donation and to help promote the event with Mark and Caroline, from 92.7

        I'm proud to say the Morrison government has also recognised STEPS' success and has chipped in to help the college grow and sustain itself. In 2019 I announced a grant of $190,000 to the STEPS Pathways College to fund the construction of two further apartments at their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_House" rel="nofollow">

        facility. These are now complete and have increased the capacity of the college from 10 to 14 students. More accommodation not only means more individuals can benefit from the training but also it enriches the social experience for students and ensures that more ongoing funds are available to keep the college sustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm grateful to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme for joining me at the STEPS official opening, at the beginning of March, of those two new apartments. Though the weather was grey it couldn't dampen the enthusiasm of the many stakeholders, parents and supporters who came along to see the plaque unveiled and hear the minister speak. The highlight of the day for me was the wonderful pot that was handmade and presented to the minister by STEPS ex-student Ariana Nioa. I'm told this was a one-off, but I know a few people in our community would be very happy to get their hands on one. So, Ari, if you ever make more, let me know! Congratulations to founder Carmel Crouch,
