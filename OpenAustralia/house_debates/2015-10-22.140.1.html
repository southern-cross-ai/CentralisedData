         Peter Nicholson
        </a>
        from Nicholson Fine Foods. Peter is based in Yamba and has just won five awards at the recent Sydney Royal Fine Food Show. The company's Euro-style spiced beetroot finishing vinegar won the gold medal and then went on to win the savoury food champion award as well as being named the overall Australian champion after earlier picking up an award from the Royal Hobart Fine Food Awards—quite a stunning result. But the company was not finished at the Sydney Royal, where they also picked up a gold medal for their savoury pickled cherries and bronze for their spiced raspberry finishing vinegar. Well done, Peter. I have sampled many of their products, and they are a great company.

        </a>
        132 to 115 in the tournament final played in Brisbane. Carly was the captain of the side. When Australia batted, Amy entered the fray in the second batting pair. Amy and her partner put Australia in a strong position, scoring 76 runs from their eight overs. By the time Carly walked out to bat in the last pair, Australia needed just two runs to draw level. Well done girls.

        The CWA was formed in 1922 when country women were fighting isolation and a lack of access to facilities. The CWA today lobby political parties, raise money for charity, support victims of domestic violence and lobby on environmental matters.
