       <p>
        Saturday was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McHappy_Day" rel="nofollow">
         McHappy Day
        </a>
        , and I had the pleasure of joining some local residents, community groups and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonalds" rel="nofollow">
         McDonalds
        </a>
        staff to fundraise for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald McDonald House
        </a>
        . Now in its 24th year, McHappy Day has raised more than $28 million for Ronald McDonald House charities, thanks to the generosity of people in communities all over Australia. This has enabled the organisation to continue to provide much-needed funds, services and programs for seriously ill children and their families. I would like to thank everyone who was involved with McHappy Day from around the Petrie electorate for their contribution. I had the chance to meet many different peopleâ€”people from the local Clontarf Beach scout groups and young people who were helping to collect and running a local car wash. It was great to meet them and their leaders. Thank you for your contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would especially like to mention the owner of McDonalds Bracken Ridge, Mr Rod Chiapello. Rod is a community champion. Many people regard multinational corporations as self-serving and only in it for the profits, but Rod Chiapello is the prime example of a local operator from a multinational corporation who is all about community. He supports many charities and people in the local community, not just Ronald McDonald House but schools, chaplaincy groups and a whole range of people.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Brent Sweeney from the Bracken Ridge Baptist Church so rightly puts it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Rod Chiapello is well known as a man of service throughout our local community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you asked any local who the most generous person in our area was, they would likely respond 'Rod from McDonalds'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He never waits to be asked for help, but rather he looks for any opportunity to give something. If there is a community organisation with an event on, Rod is there.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He seems to run his entire business on the premise that giving is better than receiving.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brent is absolutely right: that is the way Rod runs his business.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is people like Rod Chiapello who brighten our communities. They work hard to support their families and they work even harder to support their employees, community organisations, schools and people in difficult circumstances who they may not have met and may never meet. On behalf of the Petrie electorate and those in the Bracken Ridge community, I congratulate Mr Rod Chiapello. Thank you, Rod, for your altruistic service.
