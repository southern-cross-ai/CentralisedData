        A much loved and true public intellectual, Professor Geoffrey Bolton, died last month in Perth at the age of 83. Geoffrey had a special connection with the electorate of Perth being a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Perth" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        boy. His prodigious intellect was first recognised as a boy at North Perth Primary School. One of his many books,
        <i>
         Daphne Street
        </i>
        , was a history of the street in North Perth where he grew up. I never had the pleasure of studying under him at university, but my many friends who did were immense enthusiasts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the years, I benefited from his delivery of many public lectures and from his participation in the public life of

        </a>
        . Geoffrey was a pioneer in promoting the history of WA, releasing the state from the cultural cringe that undervalued our own history. One of his first books in 1958 was a biography of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Forrest" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . In 1972 he wrote
        <i>
         A Fine Country to Starve in
        </i>
        , a social history of WA during the Depression which unashamedly revealed a political perspective. He was also an historian of national standing, writing acclaimed biographies of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Barton" rel="nofollow">
         Edmund Barton
        </a>
        and

        </a>
        . He had a pivotal role in establishing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdoch_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and giving it a direction so that it was not just another establishment university. I pass on our deepest condolences to his wife of 57 years, Carol, and to all his family.
