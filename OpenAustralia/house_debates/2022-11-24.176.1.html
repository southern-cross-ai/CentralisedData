        Peakhurst West Swimming Pool was built by the community, and it needs to be maintained for the community. The Peakhurst Amateur Swimming Club swims there, as does the Penshurst

        swim club and many community led groups, such as the one run by Roy Cho. Peakhurst West Swimming Pool must be preserved. With the departure of BlueFit from the pool, it is very important to state government steps in and provides funding to ensure the continued operation of Peakhurst West Swimming Pool, which is a critical part of our community.

        The St George Australian Football Club is one of the great institutions of our area. Just recently, I attended their annual dinner, and it was great to see Angie Zissis, Brendan Donohue and all the executive and players of the club. The club has gone from strength to strength in recent years and now has a very strong and active female division within the club with lots of female players, which is a wonderful thing to see. The event was held at

        Pastor Noah Ho at Riverwood Baptist Church leads are large and very important congregation in our community. Recently, the church has undergone quite an extensive series of renovations, with new meeting rooms added, as well as a great outdoor area for the community to gather, and it was wonderful to visit Noah recently and see the renovations. Thank you to Riverwood Baptist Church for everything you do for our community and for the important role that you play within it.

        For many years, Happy Singing Group at Hurstville has been bringing goodwill to our community through the efforts of its singers. The group has really high-quality singers from lots of different genres of music. I want to thank David Guo and Karen, as well, from Happy Singing Group and everyone who's been involved in this organisation over the years. COVID was a difficult time for all singing groups around the country, and certainly that was the case in our community, but Happy Singing Group is doing a wonderful job bringing people together and celebrating the joy and the majesty of music.
