        On behalf of the Assistant Treasurer, I move:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Proposed fit-out of new leased premisesâ€”

       <p>
        The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment proposes to fit out new lease premises in the Canberra city.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWE" rel="nofollow">
         AWE
        </a>
        currently occupies 39,077 square metres across three premises in Canberra. Following rigorous analysis of accommodation options, AWE has proposed to consolidate all Civic based staff from two premises into one tenancy, known as Civic Quarter 2. This project does not impact AWE's tenancy in the John Gorton Building in Canberra. This will reduce the total net lettable area for AWE by 6,037 square metres. The fit-out plans indicate that the proposed tenancy would have an occupational density of 12 square metres per occupied work point. The estimated cost of the works is $78 million, and it will be funded through a landlord incentive of $74 million and a departmental appropriation of $4 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWC" rel="nofollow">
         PWC
        </a>
        on 15 May 2020. The committee made two recommendations: (a) that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project and (b) that AWE report back to the PWC with six-monthly written updates until the completion of the works. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in February 2021 and occupation of the building is scheduled for between August and September of 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
