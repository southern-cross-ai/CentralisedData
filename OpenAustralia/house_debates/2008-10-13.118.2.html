         Melbourne Cup
        </a>
        Day fast approaching, it is timely that the issue of having a truly national public holiday has again come to the forefront. In February 2006 I prepared a private members motion recognising that the Melbourne Cup has become a national event observed by the majority of Australians and, as such, it would be highly appropriate that it be observed as a national public holiday, replacing the Queen’s Birthday public holiday. While the motion was not debated on the floor of the parliament, it remains an issue of considerable importance to me. So I was pleased to read that Tom Percy

        in Perth in his

        </i>
        magazine column yesterday expressed a similar sentiment. As Mr Percy points out, why not make the day of ‘the race that stops the nation’ a day where work officially stops across the nation?

        the public holiday for the Queen’s birthday has no correlation with

        ’s birthday. It is months later. It is tied to nothing more than the footy and nice weather. Thousands of Perth people gather at Ascot for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup_Day" rel="nofollow">

        celebrations. With a strong racing industry in Western Australia, particularly in my electorate of Canning, it is without doubt that Melbourne Cup Day is as important to Western Australians as it is to those on the east coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        As public sentiment moves away from traditional ties to the monarchy, the leaders of both major parties have lent their weight to the republican debate, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">

        , a staunch republican, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        putting it on the government’s agenda. Perhaps now is an opportune time to reassess the importance of the Queen’s Birthday public holiday in favour of days like Melbourne Cup Day.
