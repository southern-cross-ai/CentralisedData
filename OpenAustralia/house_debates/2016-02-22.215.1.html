       <p>
        I rise to share with the House the experience of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout in the Shortland electorate. I was very interested to hear the comments of the member for Wright stating how excited he is about the NBN coming to his electorate. I have news for the member for Wright: that excitement will dissipate the moment it starts. My office has been inundated with complaints from people who have been without any telephone service, any internet service for more than two monthsâ€”and these are people that I have worked with. My staff have contacted both the service provider and the NBN. There are major technical problems. The service the people in the Shortland electorate were promised is not there. This government promised one thing before the election, and they just have not delivered. They promised fast-speed broadband, and not only are there enormous technical problems but there are also problems with the speed. People paying for 100 megabytes per second are actually getting as low as three. If this is the way the government delivers for the people of Australia, it is no wonder the people are starting to become totally disconnected from them.
