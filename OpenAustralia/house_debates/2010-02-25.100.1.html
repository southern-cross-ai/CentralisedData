       <p>
        On 13 February this year I had the great privilege of attending a celebratory dinner at the Wynnum Manly Leagues Club for the 100th anniversary of the Wynnum
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Scout Group
        </a>
        . Although Australia boasts the longest surviving civilisation in history, the descendants of European settlement have been here for a reasonably short time. So it is a very significant achievement for any organisation or group to have been in existence for 100 years. I want to put on record my congratulations to the scout group for achieving such a milestone. What is more significant is that the Wynnum Scout Group is the oldest continuing scout group in Queensland. It is not the oldest scout group. The Kangaroo Point Scout Group was formed earlier but has since been dissolved. Wynnum Scout Group was not only formed 100 years ago but has been operating for 100 years, so the anniversary dinner was a particularly special reunion. Some 136 past members came to celebrate the camaraderie and friendship they had enjoyed and the many life skills they had learnt and characteristics they had developed through their involvement in the Wynnum scouts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to put on record my particular thanks and congratulations to Debbie Shaw. Debbie has been group leader of the Wynnum Scout Group for two years but has been involved with the group for 17 or 18 years. I would also like to thank and congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Dunn" rel="nofollow">

        . Pat has been the assistant leader of the Wynnum Scout Group for 18 months but has been involved with the group for 20 years. When a group has leadership with that level of dedication, you can understand why it has lasted so long. It is no surprise that Wynnum Scout Group has continued for 100 years. As I often say, the suburbs on the south side of Brisbane, the bayside suburbs, produce some of the most resilient communities that I have ever come across. I grew up there and I went to school there. The people of the Wynnum-Manly district and surrounds are some of the most resourceful survivors, the most resilient individuals, the most well-organised and active community people you can find—not just in Brisbane but across the country. It is no accident, therefore, that the Wynnum Scout Group holds the very prestigious honour of being the longest continuing scout group. When you consider that the group has survived the two world wars, the Depression and all the other incredible events and activities of the 20th and 21st centuries it is amazing that it has lasted so long.

         If I
        </a>
        am correct, the group has survived four kings and served under one queen.
       </p>
       <p>
        We actually had a King’s Scout attending the anniversary dinner. When you consider how long
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth" rel="nofollow">
         Queen Elizabeth
        </a>
        has reigned over this country, a King’s Scout is very special. I am not going to give away his age, but I will say that he is still very active and gave a wonderful speech. His reminiscences of what he as a scout was required to do when camping, compared to the equipment and facilities that scouts have today, were quite remarkable. They literally had to find a campsite, chop down trees, make their own tents and make their own tools. When you compare that to what our young scouts enjoy today, it is testament to their survival skills and resilience. I am sure that is why many scouts of that era still enjoy a very active life today, although they are now senior citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that we acknowledge the role of organisations in our community such as the scouts. It is not just about their good service and the good work they do to support members of the community in times of need. It is also about the incredible work they do in giving skills to our young people and getting them out there to be active and community minded. They build up a sense of team and community spirit and contribute to what will be a very well behaved generation in the future.
