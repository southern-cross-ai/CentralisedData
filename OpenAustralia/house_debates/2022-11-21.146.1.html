        One of the best things about being a member for Cunningham is being able to meet local community champions. The work they do is energising and it's inspiring. On Saturday I was delighted to join state MP Paul Scully and our lord mayor, Gordon Bradbery, to watch one of our community champions, Andrew Webb, raise money for his son Callum's school, Aspect South Coast. Andrew was attempting to break the Guinness world record for the most weight squat-lifted in one hour. The current record is 57,717 kilograms. He was aiming to crack 60,000 kilos, or just on one tonne per minute, in an hour. That's five reps of 70 kilos every 21 seconds. He fell a little short at 55,827.20 kilos, but what an effort and what a team of supporters. They have raised over $27,000 for Aspect South Coast School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrew was supported by his amazing family, and it was an absolute pleasure to get to know his wife, Jade Webb, and their gorgeous children, Callum, Charlie and Molly, as well as Jade's mum, Lesley Reynolds, and her brother, Jeremy Reynolds, who kept Callum amused on the day. This record-breaking attempt was hosted by Steve and Brittany Psaras and their team at Black Diamond Boxing and Fitness. The event was recorded by Trent Elliot and his team at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Unknown Group
        </a>
        who built the website, did the social media and paid for the videographers so that they had all the boxes ticked to satisfy the Guinness world record requirements. The team at Webb Financial were also instrumental. Lisa was the superstar running the show on the day and was assisted by Caroline, Zoie, Leo, Sarah, Yingying and Marcus. The Webbs are very proud of their community minded team. The principal of Aspect South Coast School, Rowena Perritt, was also there with her team of teachers and admin staff, as well as families from the school. Jade's comments on Facebook summed it up:

        He didn't get the record but man he gave it everything. Our superhero. He's pretty damn cool. We 're incredibly proud of our Roo.
       </p>
       <p>
        What a team and what an effort. Details for donating are on my Facebook page from post from Saturday for anyone who would like make a donation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Straight after this event I caught up with a good friend of mine, Vicki Meadows, and her partner, Anthony Cawthorne. Vicki has been a champion for people with disabilities following her daughter Melissa's diagnosis. Lissy is autistic with severe developmental delay. Vicki has fought so hard over years to make sure that Lissy's 33 years to make sure she gets the best education and skill development possible. It takes a village, and Lissy has been supported by her grandmother, Cybil Meadows; her aunt, Karen Adamson; her brother, Michael Meadows, his partner Tika Laboyrie and their new baby Hayze; and their extended families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Efforts such as Andrew's make a huge difference to the lives of people like Callum and Melissa and their families.
