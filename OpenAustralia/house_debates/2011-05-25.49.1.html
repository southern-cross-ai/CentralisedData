        is the founder of Fatality Free Friday and lives in the mighty electorate of Fadden. This Friday is Fatality Free Friday and the Fatality Free Friday Road Safety Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that oversees the Fatality Free Friday event and is dedicated to improving road safety awareness, enhancing driver education and reducing the impact of road trauma.
       </p>
       <p>
        The establishment of a Fatality Free Friday Road Safety Foundation is designed to develop a sustainable strategy for reducing the social and economic costs of road crashes, as well as providing a platform for future research and advocacy programs. The foundation's main aim is to generate ongoing development towards road safety awareness.
       </p>

        The first such Friday was held in Australia on 27 April 2007 and internationally in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas" rel="nofollow">
         Las Vegas
        </a>
        on 25 May 2007. This is the fifth year this initiative has been held and, while it is this Friday, 27 May, there has been a range of activities. The Jacobs Well Police Beat this year staged its own road and water safety event. The World's Biggest Driving Lesson was again held, aiming for 250 learners at once to break the Guinness world record. Unfortunately, 197 participants in 10 cities did not quite make it, but I am sure they will crack it next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us remember that there are between 1,400 and 1,500 people killed every year on Australian roads. For every fatality there are 10 people injured. While there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths on our roads, the toll is still too high. I encourage everyone to go to www.FatalityFreeFriday.com. I am proud to say I am one of the 28,116 to have taken the pledge.
