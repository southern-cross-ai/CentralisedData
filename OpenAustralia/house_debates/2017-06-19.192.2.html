        Last Friday evening in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Kangaroo Island
        </a>
        —a beautiful and very innovative part of my community—there was hosted the second annual Kangaroo Island Food, Wine and Tourism Awards. It was the second presentation and it was even bigger and better than before. A new category was introduced this year: Most Outstanding Contribution by an Individual. There were two winners of the award. Representing the tourism sector was Pierre Gregor, the long-serving chairman of Tourism

        , who has grass roots experience as a B&amp;B operator. A posthumous award was given to the late Augie 'The Boss' Boettcher, who is considered a pioneer of the local food industry. Other winners included the Mercure Kangaroo Island Lodge, for best dining; Emu Ridge Eucalyptus, for best farm-gate experience; Dudley Wines Cellar Door, for cellar door experience; Hannaford and Sachs, for their unique food and beverage experience; and Kangaroo Island Ocean Safari, which was recognised as the best natural tourism experience. There was so much on offer. Kangaroo Island is a magnificent part of my electorate. I say congratulations to all of the winners, including American River Snaptop Oysters, for their best value added product award. The award for wine of the year was won by the 2015 shiraz of Kangaroo Island Trading Co. I look forward to going back to Kangaroo Island next year. It is a fantastic place and I welcome all members.
