       <p>
        The promise of Labor's National Disability Insurance Scheme is, of course, that every Australian counts, and every Australian must count. We must work harder to build a society that is truly inclusive and equal. But, when it comes to education, it is clear today that not every Australian counts. I thought about this when I visited Merriang Special Developmental School in Lalor in my electorate last week. It is an amazing school doing incredible things, and I thank the principal, Helen Halley-Coulson, for all the work that she and her team does.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to acknowledge the work of Leonie Gap, a teacher who invited me to spend time with her class, who took me to lunch and talked me through their work. It was inspiring to spend time with these kids working their way through education with support, passion and compassion from amazing teachers. I would like to take this opportunity in this place to recognise Leonie's work, Helen's work and the incredible place that is Merriang Special Developmental School.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there is so much more to be done to make sure that every Australian student with a disability gets access to a quality education. We need to work so much harder to get the data right, to end the excuses that have so often characterised Minister Birmingham's engagement with this issue. We have to work in this parliament over the life of this parliament to ensure that every school can offer the same experience to students with disabilities that Merriang Special Developmental School does.
