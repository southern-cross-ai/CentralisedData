        I want to wish Norco, my local dairy processor, a happy 125th birthday. That is right—Norco is celebrating 125 years this year. They have been part of my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Rivers
        </a>
        wider community since 1895. Norco is a 100 per cent Australian farmer-owned cooperative. Many other dairy processors have disappeared or been sold out, but not our Norco. They have over 200 dairy farmers who supply them. They employ hundreds of locals in their processing plants. I'm proud that we as a government have offered them a grant of $15 million as part of their $30 million expansion of their ice-cream facility in Lismore. Happy birthday, Norco! I thank everyone who buys Norco products for supporting a farmer-owned cooperative.

        I would like to take this opportunity to recognise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Reid" rel="nofollow">
         Ray Reid
        </a>
        , who sadly passed away late last year. Ray met the love of his life, Ivy, at a dance in Woodenbong. He was devoted father and father-in-law of Graeme and Chris, Beth and Barry, Janice and Tony, Carol and David, and Debbie. He had 16 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. Despite his busy life with the farm and the family, he was a very community-minded man, Ray. He was involved in countless local organisations, had many executive positions on them. He was on the P&amp;C for the entire time his children attended the school, and much longer. He was a valued member of the Rodeo Club, the Progress Association, the

        Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge Nikita Braine and Nick Alford, who have been named Junior Surf Life Savers of the Year on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast

        </a>
        -Corindi Surf Life Saving Club. She attended an under-14s development camp last November and then recently undertook a panel-style interview when she was selected and awarded this title. Nick is a member of the Woolgoolga Surf Life Saving Club. He won the prestigious Coffs Harbour Ocean Swim last year, at the age of 13.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate has long been known for producing some of the best junior life savers in not just the state but the country. Nikita and Nick will travel to Sydney for a state camp in April for the
