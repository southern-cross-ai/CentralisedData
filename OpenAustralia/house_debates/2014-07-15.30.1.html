         Ron Hall
        </a>
        is a legendary figure in Tasmanian football, having given a lifetime of service to the game. In 2008 he was inducted into the

        . Ron was also a champion farmer, twice selected as the Tasmanian Dairy Farmer of the Year. Sadly, Ron passed away unexpectedly on 26 June, at a time when he was still making a contribution to his beloved

        —or the Magpies, as they are known. He had been organising the 50th anniversary celebrations for the Magpies' 1964 premiership team, which he played in as a 17-year-old.

        Ron showed extraordinary skill at an early age. Between 1964 and 1974, he played in six premiership-winning teams for Scottsdale, plus two losing premierships, and gained selection in the Tasmanian state team. He was lured briefly to then

        , but injury limited his opportunities. On return to Tasmania, he played nearly 300 games for Scottsdale and was honoured with life membership. After retiring, Ron coached and played for country teams like Pioneer, Winnaleah and Branxholm. At 43 he played his last game of football with Branxholm—another premiership. It is undoubtable that Ron Hall is amongst the greatest ever footballers to pull on the black and white for the Magpies. I express my sincere condolences to Ron's partner Deborah, his family, his friends and the Scottsdale Football Club.
