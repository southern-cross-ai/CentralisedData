        It's been another intense and hectic week in parliament. I have to say, I'm so incredibly proud to be a member of the Albanese Labor government team, constantly listening to and making decisions to help members of our community. One of my favourite parts of a public life is being there to listen to, talk to, communicate with and see our wonderful community members and acknowledge what they do in support of others. Recently,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        award ceremonies were held right around our country, honouring individuals for their outstanding contributions to their communities. In my electorate of Pearce, I had the privilege of witnessing three remarkable individuals being celebrated for their unwavering dedication in serving our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Derek Young, who resides in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Rocks" rel="nofollow">
         Two Rocks
        </a>
        , was acknowledged for his exceptional commitment to and leadership of the Two Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade and the Two Rocks Youth in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Services
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YES" rel="nofollow">
         YES
        </a>
        , cadets. Derek has tirelessly devoted himself to engaging, educating and fostering resilience within the community, particularly amongst our youth. His steadfast dedication has been evident for many years. In fact, I had the honour of recognising Derek during my tenure as Mayor of the City of Wanneroo, when I bestowed upon him an honour in 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Maddie Walker, also a resident of Two Rocks, epitomises community spirit. As a devoted member of the Yanchep
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        Club for the last 15 years, the beloved Nippers program director for three years and now a youth director, Maddie has played a vital role in training and inspiring young members of the community. Having grown up in the Yanchep-Two Rocks area, Maddie is renowned for her compassionate and jovial nature. Despite her commitments to work, she continues to balance her volunteering duties admirably. I extend my very best wishes to her for her future.

        Mrs Sally Allen was honoured with a senior award for her invaluable assistance to stroke survivors through the Northern Suburbs Stroke Support Group, an organisation she founded over two decades ago for her own husband's stroke, which led her to become his full-time carer. Sally's altruism extends beyond this endeavour. She has volunteered with organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance" rel="nofollow">
         St John Ambulance
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        and Surf Life Saving. Currently, she also coordinates the volunteer justice of the peace roster—I'm actually part of that roster—in our far northern suburbs. It has been a privilege to collaborate with Sally over the years, and I'm so incredibly proud of her achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community club award was bestowed upon the Yanchep Netball Club, under the exceptional leadership of Stephanie Scott and her volunteer committee. This club plays a pivotal role in providing social and inclusive sport opportunities to the local community, nurturing the development of skills and friendships while promoting fitness and activity. It is in its 50th year, and I wish them all the very best for the upcoming season.
       </p>

        I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the recipients and express my gratitude to the numerous volunteers within the Pearce community, whose tireless efforts contribute to making it, without doubt, one of the finest electorates in the country. I make no apologies for my obvious bias! Volunteering provides individuals with unique opportunities to make a positive difference to the world. By actively participating in activities that address societal needs or environmental concerns, volunteers contribute to the betterment of our community. Volunteering helps to build a sense of empathy and understanding through interaction with diverse groups. It also helps to foster a deep appreciation for the challenges faced by others.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have many such unsung heroes within all of our communities, who volunteer, often on a daily basis, to assist others, whether it be as a carer or as someone who helps by driving, gardening, cleaning or delivering goods to those in need. Volunteers play a crucial role in building strong, resilient communities, and, when they come together to contribute their time and skills, they without doubt create a network of support that rises above socioeconomic and cultural boundaries. It is also true that in times of crisis, such as natural disasters, volunteers often play a vital role in providing immediate assistance and support, helping to lift community spirit as they care for the wellbeing of their friends and neighbours.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the many that volunteer to support our fire emergency services, local residents or sporting clubs and groups—it's just amazing what they do, and their hearts just continue to go out to one another—and to the parents volunteering in our schools or supporting youth groups, such as scouts and guides or cadets: we salute you. Our volunteers deserve our recognition and thanks, for they are the glue that helps bind our communities together. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
