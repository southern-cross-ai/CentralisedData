        Labor extends its best wishes to Assyrian communities in Australia and around the world celebrating
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian New Year
        </a>
        or Akitu. Assyrian New Year is one of the oldest celebrations in history and dates back to ancient Assyrian and Babylonian empires over 6,000 years ago. Akitu is a celebration which marks the beginning of spring and symbolises the awakening of nature. Assyrian people gather with family, friends and community to welcome the season of blossoms with dancing, music, traditional food and poetry. Australia's Assyrian community in Sydney marks this special occasion with a festival at Fairfield Showground every year, attracting thousands of people, highlighting the vibrant cultural heritage that is celebrated in our diverse multicultural society. Every celebration is part of our Australian story.

        On behalf of Labor, I extend warm wishes to those celebrating Ridvan. Ridvan is a 12-day festival which celebrates the beginning of the Baha'i faith in 1863. Ridvan, translated as 'Paradise', is named after the garden of Ridvan outside Baghdad where the founder of the Baha'i faith stayed for 12 days after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         Ottoman Empire
        </a>
        exiled him. During celebrations, particularly on the first, ninth and last days, people abstain from work and take part in gatherings, parties and picnics. It is a joyous occasion and often includes reflection, prayer and reading from the Baha'i writings.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baha'i" rel="nofollow">

        faith teaches that the service of humanity can bring lasting happiness, and it is in this spirit that Ridvan is celebrated.
       </p>

        I extend Labor's best wishes to Sikh communities in Australia and around the world celebrating Vaisakhi. Vaisakhi celebrates the beginning of the harvest season and commemorates the formation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalsa_Panth" rel="nofollow">
         Khalsa Panth
        </a>
        , the baptism of five Sikh men who offered to uphold and preserve the Sikh faith by sacrificing their lives and establishing a spiritual community. During Vaisakhi, a day of remembrance, friends and family come together to read sacred texts, enjoy festive foods and socialise with loved ones. The teachings of Sikhism promote equality, unity, meaningful interactions and respect. These are values which are entrenched in the Australian story and enhance our experience of a modern, multicultural Australian society.

        Between now and when parliament returns, we will also have the Easter celebrations. For the Eastern and

        </a>
        churches, the dates are different, the Eastern churches relying on the actual observation of the vernal equinox, and the Western churches using 21 March as a fixed date. But, even though the dates change, the celebration is the same. So, whichever date people are observing for the feasts of
