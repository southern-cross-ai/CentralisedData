        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how regional Australia has been front and centre by delivering 0.7 per cent growth in today's national account figures, confirming the success of the Morrison-Joyce government navigating Australia safely through the pandemic?

         I would like to thank the unassuming, quiet and retiring member for Dawson for that question. The member for Dawson was instrumental in the Mackay Ring Road stage 2, and the one thing we're not looking forward to is another one of his postings on TikTok or Facebook. He has been absolutely incredible for Urannah dam, and I look forward to working as hard as I can and as quickly as I can to get that dam built.

         In the national accounts, agriculture has seen its highest ever gross value at $48.3 billion, up from $48.1 billion. Agriculture contributed more than a third of last year's

         growth. Prime Minister, hasn't there been a difference in the short time I've been back in the agriculture portfolio? It has been incredible to go to saleyards. I remember that once, if you got $1.20, you were doing well. I was speaking to Scotty on his property near Tamworth. I said, 'Scotty, what's the price today?' He told me it's $5 a kilogram live. I said, 'Hey, Scotty, how about we buy some fat lambs? What's that going to set me back?' He said, 'Mate, well over 200 bucks.'

           I can remember a time when, if you got $40 for a fat lamb, you were doing well. Agriculture under this government has been a roaring success because it shows we have a plan that makes sure that we work hard. I'd like to commend the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for the instant asset write-off. It is brilliant, whether for McDonald Bros Transport buying a prime mover, or you're buying a cattle crush from Guyra. Buy it for your yards and use the instant asset write-off. If you're buying panels, instant asset write-off—

             If you are doing things that make your productivity greater, you can get support from a coalition government, and the coalition government has taken this section of the economy roaring ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
             We believe in irrigation. We're building dams. A dry acre at St George probably produces about $60 worth of wool; a green acre, an irrigated acre, $9,000 worth of cotton. We know the numbers. We know how to make this economy bigger. We know how to create the economy that can pay for the great stimulus work that this government has done to keep Australians going forward, to keep our net growth going forward, to keep our nation safe and to give the Australians the hope and the safety of a plan that will take them to a better future.
