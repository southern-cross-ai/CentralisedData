         I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. The challenges we face in relation to the budget are obvious, given the fact that we now have $20 billion of savings—$5 billion of the $20 billion was actually announced by Labor—that are held up and blocked in the Senate by the Labor Party and the Greens. Of course, the Australian economy is facing challenges. That is what we have inherited from Labor.
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenges identified by the chairman and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         , Dan Akerson, today in Detroit are the same challenges that many other manufacturers and businesses in Australia are facing. I quote the CEO of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors" rel="nofollow">
          General Motors
         </a>
         Holden in Detroit. He says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         He says that and he is right: it is a challenging market in which to operate. And it is a market that has been heavily subsidised by Australian governments—in the case of Holden, $1.8 billion between 2001 and 2012. But, if money were the issue as to why Holden is leaving Australia, then why did Ford leave and Mitsubishi leave whilst Labor was in government? The money was flowing, but they decided to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the things that needs to be noted is the high cost of production. I say emphatically to the workers at Toyota, who are due to make a decision this Friday about a proposal put to them by the management of Toyota: please vote for your jobs this Friday. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
          AMWU
         </a>
         is recommending a vote against a proposal put forward by Toyota to try and have a fairer arrangement in the workplace. For example, Toyota exports 70 per cent of its produce to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . At the moment, Toyota has to close its plant for 21 days over Christmas. How does that work when you are trying to export to the Middle East, where they do not celebrate Christmas? And now Toyota has gone back to the workers and said, 'Please reduce this to 10 days so that we can have consistent supply,' and the AMWU is recommending a vote against it. The AMWU would not even meet with Toyota management, because the AMWU wanted to have 53 people turn up—

             I thank the member for his question. This is a very important issue that confronts us, ensuring that we have competitive industries in this country. It seems passing strange that the member can feign support for these workers at a time when the opposition are standing in the way of this government making Australia a more competitive place, because that is the key to ensuring the future of jobs, ensuring that we have a competitive economy that is in fact operating at a world-class level. So rather than the assistance of the members opposite, we have the gaggle opposite just standing there and moaning rather than getting behind the abolition of the carbon tax, the abolition of the mining tax and the government improving the efficiency of this economy.
            </p>
            <p>
             But with regard to the matters that the member raises specifically, I would say that any worker made redundant in the automotive manufacturing industry will receive immediate access to intensive employment assistance support through the Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program. This program is delivered by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Job Services Australia
             </a>
             and provides support for job seekers at a stream 3 level. That is support. But the best way that we can ensure the future of these workers is to make the Australian economy as competitive as it can be. So it is about time members opposite got out of the way of this government and allowed us to make Australia the efficient economy that it should be.

               in Detroit. Nobody should be making light or politics about this decision. This is a decision that affects thousands and thousands of

                South Australian
               </a>
               s and Victorians. It is a tragic situation that Australia is in the position that it is. It is the kind of country that makes it very difficult, very difficult to manufacture such high-end products as motor vehicles because of our labour costs; because of the way that we do business in this country; because of our high Australian dollar; because of our lack of export markets, particularly for Holden; and because of decisions that have been made beyond our shores that we have had very little, if any, control over. South Australians have been well aware of this for a long time. South Australians understand how important the car industry is to our state, but they also understand how fragile it has been for a very long time. This government, as the previous government did, tried to keep those operations in South Australia and Victoria because we always put people first—never ideology, always people. The Deputy Prime Minister has outlined very well the difficulties that Holden and other car manufacturers have faced. Mitsubishi faced these difficulties and Mitsubishi closed. It does not matter on whose watch it closed, Mitsubishi closed.

                          Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am happy to rephrase the question. I direct the question to the

                          . I refer to the announcement by Holden today that it will be discontinuing vehicle manufacturing in Australia by 2017. What does the Acting Prime Minister say to the 1,600 Holden workers in

                           The question indeed contains a great deal of argument which I would dispute. The reality is that this government has taken substantial steps in the short time it has been in office to actually improve the environment for the manufacturing industry in Australia and, in particular, for the car-manufacturing sector. It is unfortunate that I have to report to the House that it is well known to everybody who has been observing what has happened in the parliament over the last few weeks that the opposition, who, today are feigning concern about the fate of the industry—

We have worked constructively to try and provide a better environment for the car industry in this country. You have had the opportunity to indicate support and to take a significant cost, around $400 a vehicle, off that industry by supporting us in our endeavours to get rid of the carbon tax.

So there is significant funding there, still available, to assist the automotive industry in this country. So suggestions that reductions of $500 million, or whatever it might be at some stage in the future, have made any impact in relation to the industry at this time are clearly nonsense. There is substantial funding still available.
