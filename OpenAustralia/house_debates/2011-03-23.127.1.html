       <p>
        I rise tonight to highlight issues relating to the digital television switch-over in my electorate of Dawson. The residents of Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay in the Whitsundays are justifiably upset at the fact that they feel they have been effectively left out of the switch-over. These residents need access to the same local television broadcast that exists in other communities within Mackay and the Whitsundays—a service that could perhaps have been provided with the funds wasted on television advertising to promote digital television.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been told by the office of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        that it may be beyond the laws of physics for a local transmission to be made available to Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay. However, locals involved in the television antenna industry believe differently. I have put a question on notice to the minister representing the communications minister in this chamber, asking them to detail why it is not physically possible. I suppose that only then will I be satisfied that it is not just an excuse to avoid spending dollars to get equality in television reception for these residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Access to local television goes far beyond watching
        <i>
         Neighbours
        </i>
        of an evening or watching question time on the ABC. Queenslanders are very aware of what an emergency information broadcast for a cyclone sounds like, and particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        ers. We now have satellite, radar and a world of weather monitoring technology, but it is of no consequence if the local television emergency broadcast—that last link in the chain—is missing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is appropriate that I have the opportunity to address the House today because, as the member for Herbert outlined so eloquently before, exactly 100 years ago on this very day a similar scenario cost the lives of 122 people off the North Queensland coast. On 23 March 1911 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS" rel="nofollow">
         SS
        </a>
        <i>
         Yongala
        </i>
        steamed out of Mackay, bound for Townsville. As the
        <i>
         Yongala
        </i>
        headed into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Coral Sea
        </a>
        , a telegram to warn of a cyclone between Mackay and Townsville was received at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Top_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flat Top Island
        </a>
        signal station, just off Mackay. It was a fraction too late; when wireless technology was uncommon, the final link in the cyclone warning chain failed. The
        <i>
         Yongala
        </i>
        steamed on to its demise and, as was outlined before, there were no survivors. We have come a long way in 100 years, but if we fail to keep that last link in the chain the consequences can be as drastic as they were for the
        <i>
         Yongala
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The switch-over to digital television will also send business to an early demise. In my electorate, Hydeaway Bay Caravan Park owner, Roz Willcocks, knows that when analog television closes shop she will probably have to do the same thing. The cheapest of the two options that have been put to her in the switch-over will cost the business $25,000 plus a large labour bill. The other option put to her had a starting cost of $100,000, and Mrs Wilcox told me that she stopped reading at that point. For loss of television signal to close down this business is a sad reflection on how this government does not care for small business.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Roz Willcocks and her husband, both in their 50s, this is more than the loss of a business. It is the loss of a livelihood and a lifestyle. Offering a part subsidy for residential premises is an insult, but to snub small business altogether is offensive.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I appeared on the local television news in Mackay seeking community feedback on digital reception, the staff in my electorate office were ready to string me up and beat me like a pinata. There was an avalanche of complaints that range from very poor signals with constant interruptions to no signal at all. I hope that when Regional Broadcasting Australia appoints a local coordinator for the Mackay region and the Dawson area they will address each and every one of those concerns, because unless I am satisfied that all that can be done is going to be done to ensure there is a reliable local digital television transmission that is going to get to all of the residents in the Dawson electorate who can physically receive such a transmission, then I am afraid I cannot support the switch-over to digital this year.
