        Too often I hear clubs and not-for-profits in Bonner are eager to get off the ground but find it difficult to find a space to meet with members and supporters, as many

        meeting rooms and libraries are at full capacity. Fortunately, I come bearing some good news. If you are part of a community group in Bonner, my boardroom is free for you to use as you wish, such as for meetings or events. That's right: the Alan Burge Community Room is officially open.

        Over the last few years, Mr Alan Burge has been expertly tuning and restoring an Australian made 1907 Beale upright grand piano in my office. Alan's perseverance and joy throughout the project has been such a testament to the goodwill and talent of so many Australians that I have decided to name this great space after him. It's been a pleasure to host Alan as he restored this piano to its former glory. I look forward to welcoming more of the community into the Bonner office and seeing the potential of this space fully unlocked and appreciated, just like my piano. We've already had some booking requests come through, so I encourage interested groups to secure their spot. If you are interested in using the Alan Burge Community Room, please send me an email. I know it will be a versatile resource for many.
