         I thank the shadow minister for the question. Perhaps I can begin by reminding him and all members that last Wednesday afternoon the High Court handed down a decision which required the release of individuals from immigration detention.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Court" rel="nofollow">
          The High Court
         </a>
         handed down a decision which we, of course, are complying with. I would say that, as we heard earlier, not every Australian government has complied with the requirements of the law nor respected separation of powers.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I

         say this too?

          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         argued against the decision that ultimately the High Court maintained. But, of course, we were prepared, as I think the shadow minister's question suggests, for this outcome because of the significance of this case. Members would appreciate that the case has overturned a precedent of nearly two decades.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout this, community safety has been our No. 1 concern, and I say to the Australian community that it will continue to be our No. 1 concern. I hope that that is the concern that is echoed across this chamber and in the other place. To that end, the

            That is not serious, and this is a serious issue. We moved quickly to ensure that we issued visas to impacted individuals with appropriate conditions to ensure that community safety can be upheld, including requirements to report readily to the department to inform the minister of any changes of personal details such as address, social media profiles, restrictions of industries on employment and a range of other conditions. This is in addition to state and territory requirements, which go to the issues that you were talking about,

           </p>
           <p>
            We have been required to release people almost instantly. That is the decision of the court. But we continue to consider all measures that may be available to strengthen our protection of the community. I note, of course, that we are yet to have the reasons for the court's decision. We have been approaching this issue in anticipation of a decision, because we regard community safety seriously. We continue to do so, unlike members opposite, whose record in this area is an unmitigated disaster.
