       <p>
        I am pleased to move the government amendments that have been circulated. They will improve this bill and, importantly, fix a number of implementation issues that have arisen under the current framework. In 2012 the now Leader of the Opposition introduced amendments to this act which were rushed through the parliament with minimal consideration. Since that time, a number of issues have arisen that need rectification.
       </p>
       <p>
        Interestingly, a number of the issues that have arisen as a result of the now Leader of the Opposition's own amendments have been bizarrely identified by those opposite as reasons not to support this bill. For example, Labor members have said in this debate that disclosure goes above and beyond the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Corporations Act
        </a>
        . For the benefit of members opposite, I can advise that the level of disclosure was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition himself in his second reading speech, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will require the rules of registered organisations to provide for the disclosure of remuneration, including board fees, of the five highest paid officials of the organisation as well as the two highest paid in each branch, to the members of the organisation. Determining the five highest paid officials will be based upon monetary remuneration rather than non-cash benefits. However, where an official's remuneration is required to be disclosed, that disclosure will require non-cash benefits paid to the official to be identified.
       </p>
       <p>
        These requirements came into effect on 1 January this year under the current act as implemented by the Leader of the Opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor members have said in this debate that disclosure is too invasive and covers family members. The government agrees and again notes that this level of disclosure was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition himself. I will quote him again. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the amendments proposed by the government, registered organisations will be required to amend their rules to provide for the disclosure of transactions between the organisation and related parties, which may include the family members of officials.
       </p>
       <p>
        These requirements came into effect on 1 January this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor members have said in the debate that even those with lots of experience require the training, but this was another requirement introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition. His new training requirement required that all existing officers received training before 1 July.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today the opposition will have the opportunity to put its money where its mouth is and support fixing these problems that have come up as a result as the Leader of the Opposition's rushed amendments. These amendments are common sense. They amend the disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations to more closely align them with the Corporations Act so that the requirement to disclose material personal interest applies only to those officers whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation. They remove the more invasive disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations to report family members' material personal interests and thereby more closely align with the Corporations Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments align the material personal interest disclosure requirement for officers of registered organisations with the Corporations Act so that disclosures need to be made only to the governing body and not to the entire membership. They limit disclosures of related payments to payments made above a certain prescribed threshold with certain other exceptions based on the exceptions of the Corporations Act and member approval of related party transactions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the amendments provide the Registered Organisations Commissioner with the discretion to waive the training requirements of officers of registered organisations if the commissioner is satisfied they fully understand their financial duties because of their level of qualification—for example, if a member is a certified and practising accountant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me be very clear: unless these amendments pass the parliament, officials of registered organisations will continue to run the very real risk of being in breach of the laws as they stand today in relation to the issues identified by the opposition that I mentioned earlier. If this bill and these amendments are not passed, officials of registered organisations must declare all material personal interests of their family members under the current law or face financial penalties. So the opposition has a decision to make. It can either support the coalition's efforts to clean up this mess created by the Leader of the Opposition or it can allow its laws to prevail and see the consequences of that. I commend the amendments to the House.
       </p>

        Question agreed to.
