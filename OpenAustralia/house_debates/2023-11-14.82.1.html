       <p>
        by leave—I rise to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Carr" rel="nofollow">
         Helena Carr
        </a>
        , who passed away suddenly while travelling in Europe with her beloved husband and life partner, Bob.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helena did not hold public office, but she was held in great respect and esteem by all who knew her, right across the political spectrum. Among those who gathered at St Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney in her memory today were Premier Chris Minns, former prime ministers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Keating
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        and, fittingly, a host of former premiers, not least
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rann" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Rann
        </a>
        , who flew from Europe to be present.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given Helena’s modesty, we can only wonder how she might have reacted. It was a modesty matched by equally innate talents. At one point in her impressive career, she was managing director of security printing firm Leigh-Mardon, which at the time had 1,100 employees and an annual turnover of $160 million—and that’s in 1990 dollars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, her shyness was coupled with a great inner strength. Once, when an overwhelmed Bob was tempted to pack it in as opposition leader, it was Helena who put him back on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        That didn't mean she had an appetite for every aspect of political life. In 1991, amid speculation that Premier Nick Greiner was about to call an election, Helena was told to get ready to stand by Bob's side. As Helena recalled to me, she walked up Martina Place praying Nick wouldn't do it. That particular prayer was destined to go unanswered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Election campaigns were not something Helena was naturally inclined towards, but she threw herself into them anyway, a happy warrior standing by Bob's side through all the slings and arrows. It was a path she kept following, including for the seven years Bob served as opposition leader, his decade as Premier, then his period as senator and Minister for Foreign Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a product of Catholic schooling myself, I can only imagine that some of Helena's strength came from the nuns who taught her, first at the convent school in Taiping, Malaysia, then at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_College" rel="nofollow">
         Mercy College
        </a>
        in Parramatta, where she was welcomed by the girls and nuns alike. Helena would've been deeply touched that some of the nuns from OLMC attended today's funeral.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even after all these decades, it remains remarkable to think that Helena was among the first generation of Asian migrants to win permanent residency as the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         White Australia
        </a>
        policy disintegrated, a process that began under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Holt" rel="nofollow">
         Harold Holt
        </a>
        and was finalised under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        . Indeed, four of her five siblings and their families have settled here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helena made friends easily at school and at university and excelled at every undertaking. We are lucky that Helena chose this great country. Malaysia's loss was Australia's gain, and Australia's gain was Bob's greatest fortune.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob and Helena Carr made a whole world together. Amid the tragedy of Helena's sudden passing, Bob channelled his grief into a public tribute, a powerful declaration of unconditional love at a time when there is too much hate in the world. In it Bob wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She was the light of my life, the little friend always there. No one ever smiled more, or with more spirit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is inconceivable I could have won office for my party and held the premiership for over 10 years without the steadiness of her companionship, her sense of fun and her lambent eyes.
       </p>
       <p>
        He concluded:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The light has gone out of my life. I know many have faced this challenge, the loss of a life partner, the journey no one wishes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One reason to trying is my sense she is there telling me to go on for her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps it's fitting the last opera that she saw on that final perfect day with Bob in Vienna was Donizetti's
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elixir_of_Love" rel="nofollow">
          The Elixir of Love
         </a>
        </i>
        . Wrapped up in the beauty of the music, the great theme at its height is the triumph of sincerity, and it leaves everyone, cast and audience alike, uplifted into happiness. So perfectly Helena, it's a reminder that not everyone who contributes to our political life is someone who's elected to public office. Often it's the people who back us up day after day, week after week, month after month and, in Helena's case, not just a year after year—decade after decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to her and I give my condolences to Bob, the extended Carr family and Helena's extended family. May we all hold onto her glow and may Helena Carr rest in peace.

        <p>
         I spoke to the Prime Minister earlier today in relation to his desire to seek leave on this matter, and, of course, we granted it, for many reasons. Firstly, out of respect for the Prime Minister and his relationship with Helena and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Carr" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Carr
         </a>
         . Listening to the Prime Minister, his pain that he wasn't able to be there today was obvious. He worked with the Carr family very closely as part of the staff, and as part of the broader family, effectively. So we send our condolences to you, Prime Minister, and, more importantly, to Bob Carr, who has been a servant of the Labor Party for many decades, a servant of this parliament and a great representative for our country, not just as Premier of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         but in his time as a senator and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sudden passing of Helena came as a shock to all because she was such a vibrant character. But, as the Prime Minister rightly points out, she was a conscript in this business. All of us have stuck our hands up and we're here as elected members of parliament. She wasn't in that category. She was a conscript, but a very loyal one—a loyal one to Bob, always being by his side and supporting him in the decisions that he made during the course of his public life, but also in his private life. And, as we know, if we're being honest, none of us can truly contribute to full effect in this place if we don't have that support of the people who love us most.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bob Carr deserves our recognition today for the pain and grief that he and his family are going through. We extend our condolences to him and to the broader Labor Party on the loss of Helena—a life well lived; a lady of great grace; and a great contributor, in her own right, to the Labor Party, to the state of New South Wales and to our great country.
