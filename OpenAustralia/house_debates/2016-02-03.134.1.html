        I would like to rise today to speak about the importance of education in a community, and the fantastic role that schools play in the towns in my electorate. While obviously the backbone of schools is the teaching staff, they rely heavily on administration and assorted staff to help run those schools. Today I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Dubbo resident Melva Blake. Melva has just retired after 46 years in administration at Dubbo West Public School. In an era where people not only change jobs on a regular basis but also change careers, it is very refreshing to know there are people who are dedicated and who are prepared to contribute 46 years to one job.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that time Melva has worked with 12 different principals, including the current principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . They speak with great admiration for the way that Melva has kept West Dubbo Public School on an even keel. She has been the face at the front desk that greets parents and new students alike. Over those 46 years, she has been involved in the education of several generations of the same family. It is important that we have role models like Melva Blake, who can show that it is important to be dedicated to a task, that they understand the importance of education, and that they understand that for an environment to be conducive to good learning, an institution has to be run in an efficient, caring and professional manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        So for the thousands of students who have been touched by Melva during their time at West Dubbo Public School, on their behalf I would like to congratulate her on a wonderful career. I wish her all the best in her retirement. Melva is a pocket dynamo. I am sure she will not be idle. She is very involved in many organisations in the Dubbo community. Least of all, she will be able to spend more time with her husband, Mike, and her adult children.
