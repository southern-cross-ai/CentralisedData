        . I also awarded recipients of the New South Wales Premier's citation and volunteer recognition awards from the Centre for Volunteering.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2018 alone, St John Ambulance trained a million people in first aid; provided half a million volunteer hours for first aid and event health; provided 3Â½ million hours of community care; and transported 160,000 non-emergency patients to hospitals, community or mental health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        St John was founded in Australia in 1883 and has since developed into the organisation we know today. The Hornsby division of St John Ambulance comprises 50 officers and 35 cadets. The division was founded in 1958. The division alone averages 5,000 hours in the local community each year and helps over 200 patients. There are a number of St John members who are professional paramedics, doctors or allied health professionals while others have no professional health background.
       </p>
       <p>
        The St John long service awards have been awarded by the order since 1898. It's a well-deserved acknowledgment of many hours of volunteering. Recipients of the order of St John long service medal included

         The Premier
        </a>
        of New South Wales Bushfire Emergency Citation is a new award established this year by the Premier to recognise the outstanding contribution of volunteers and service agency personnel who played a significant role in the emergency response effort to combat the 2019-20 bushfires. St John Ambulance volunteers tirelessly worked during the 2019-20 bushfires with many being deployed to various evacuation centres providing medical services. The Premier's citation is an award that recognises their efforts. Recipients of the 2019-20 bushfire citations were Pierre Baudou-Daniel, Kirsten Burghard, Rachel Chapman, Samantha Davis, Marco Franse, Callum Gray, Malcolm Knight, Lachlan Liao and Daynah Nash.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also worth noting this year that many St John Ambulance volunteers have also served on the front line during COVID at testing clinics and hotels, and checking temperatures at events. Volunteer recognition awards were given to Patrick Gibb, Amanullah Haidary,
