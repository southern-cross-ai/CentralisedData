        As we all well know, home ownership is a very important part of our culture. But the great Australian dream is quickly becoming a nightmare for young Australians. That home among the gum trees has been immortalised in music, literature and the big screen and it has some meaning for two-thirds of us. But, sadly, it will be an ever-more unattainable dream for many young Australians unless 'Mr Harbourside Mansion' actually gets serious about housing affordability.

        Ownership rates for young people have declined from 60 per cent down to 48 per cent, but the cost of housing continues to steeply increase.

        government is: 'Get a good job,' 'Get rich parents,' 'Move to the bush,' or, that gem from the Assistant Treasurer, 'Get a highly paid job.' All of Australia, but especially our young people, now really need a government with backbone.
