        state election on Saturday. Chris Minns will make a wonderful premier, and I congratulate him on his victory. I want to pay tribute to some really great new members of parliament: Sally Quinnell in Camden, Nathan Hagarty in Leppington, Charishma Kaliyanda in Liverpool, Karen McKeown in Penrith and Maryanne Stuart in Heathcote. They are wonderful local people who I know very well and who will do their electorates proud. They will be great representatives of the west and south-west in the New South Wales parliament, and they will make sure that we get what we need from the state government to make our areas prosper.
       </p>

        I'd also like to pay tribute to Judy Hannan, who's the new independent member for Wollondillyâ€”it looks like she has won that seat. She's a local optometrist who I've known and worked with for many years, and I congratulate her on her victory. She will be a great member of parliament as well.
       </p>

        These are all wonderful new members of our New South Wales state parliament. They're part of the really great team that represents the west and south-west in the parliament. They know the local area, and they've lived and worked in the area for many years. They've worked hard to win, and I think they will be great representatives. I congratulate them all, and I look forward to working with them, together with the member for Werriwa,

        , to represent the south-west in federal parliament and to make sure our area gets what it needs.
