        You just cannot beat a country show, and that's why tonight I rise to pay tribute to some of the wonderful agricultural show societies in Calare that strive to keep their local show going strong year after year.

        The first-ever Lithgow Show was held in 1885. In the past 139 years, it has become a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">

        institution. The 2024 Lithgow Show was an absolute cracker featuring a grand parade, classic cars, a lighthorse display and fireworks, just to name a few. Among the extensive line-up of competitions, two new categories were added: the pet pooch show and the Mullet of the Year award. The inaugural mullet winner was Brendan Burgess. Well done to him!
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, Maureen Ford was awarded the Lithgow Show Champion Award for more than 50 years of service to the Lithgow Show. She started volunteering in 1971, the year 'Eagle Rock' from

        At the event, Doreen Peters and other members of the show society, including Carol Crossman, April Pilarcik, Margaret Latty and Sue Giokaris, put on a lovely high tea. Doreen won the scone section at the show, so, as you can imagine, the spread was absolutely extraordinary, Mr Deputy Speaker. Well done to you all!
       </p>
       <p>
        A huge thank you to the Lithgow Show Society executive, whose hard work and dedication ensure that the show continues to go from strength to strength. Thank you to President David Peters, Senior Vice President John Baxter, Secretary Vanetta Renshaw, Treasurer Kim Drury and Publicity Officer Lauren Elkins.

        This year was the 85th year of the Rylstone-Kandos Show, and some would say it was the best one yet. Held in mid-February, the day was jam-packed with horse ring events; the dog show; cattle, sheep, poultry and bird judging; woodchopping; the farmers' challenge; dog jumping; children's novelty events; and, of course, the stunning fireworks display. The show society made sure the showground looked an absolute picture, and I really enjoyed catching up with so many community members who do so much to make our corner of the country a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to particularly acknowledge the horse stewards, who did an absolutely outstanding job with their display, but also all of the other hardworking volunteers. A big thank you to President Rachael Mann, who did an outstanding job; Secretary Marion Crossman; and committee members Ben Suttor, Max Suttor,

        This year the Rydal Show celebrated 101 years. The Rydal Show continues to be a country show powerhouse thanks to the hard work and support of so many kind-hearted community members. The 2024 show was a special one for me personally, because after several years of trying I was pretty chuffed to finally pick up a gong in the special scone section for pollies. It's always hotly contested. After whipping up my batch of scones, I can tell you my kitchen was in quite a state, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it was all for a worthy cause. Reigning champion Natasha Hadley again took home the gold medal in the scone open section. Well done, Natasha!

        Congratulations also to Margie Lowe, who received the
