        It's a great honour to welcome Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau here to the Australian parliament from Vanuatu. I ask members to give him a welcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honourable members: Hear, hear!
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir, you, your delegation and your ministers are very welcome visitors here today. You were greeted at the front of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        by me, the Leader of the Opposition and other dignitaries here this morning. This is the first time a prime minister of Vanuatu has made an official visit here since 2018. Today we were able to make great progress on some of our shared priorities, including progressing sectors such as infrastructure, cybersecurity, trade and agriculture. Australia and Vanuatu are longstanding friends. We are partners—equal partners—guided by mutual respect and a shared commitment to a prosperous, peaceful and resilient Pacific. On Vanuatu's independence in 1980, Australia was proud to gift the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Vanuatu" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament of Vanuatu
        </a>
        with it's Speaker 's chair, an enduring symbol of the democratic values that we share.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last December, Senator Wong led an Australian bipartisan delegation to visit Vanuatu, where they were warmly welcomed by you, Prime Minister. On that visit, Minister Wong and Prime Minister Kalsakau signed our landmark bilateral security agreement. One of the things that we've agreed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands Forum
        </a>
        is that we in the Pacific need to secure our own region here, and the Pacific family needs to look after each other. The agreement recognises that Australia's and Vanuatu's security interests are deeply intertwined, and it lays out a framework for strengthening our partnership even further. Today we committed to ratifying that agreement, and I look forward to bipartisan support in this parliament to ratify that security agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise and commend the Prime Minister for his longstanding leadership in pushing for increased global action on climate change, which we spoke about again here this morning. Once again, I thank you, Prime Minister, for joining us here today, and wish you a very warm, Australian welcome.
       </p>

        <p>
         on indulgence—I thank the Prime Minister for those words and join with him in welcoming you, Prime Minister Kalsakau, and your delegation. We had the opportunity of meeting earlier today, and it was wonderful to see you in person after having met last time across the video screen, as was the case in many of our interactions over the course of the last couple of years. The dedication and leadership that you've shown to your country and the capacity that you have to steer your country through good times and bad is something that we acknowledge and applaud today.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister rightly points out, we hope that you and your delegation—particularly the minister for commerce, the minister for agriculture and the other distinguished guests in your party—can take back a message that there is a bipartisan position of support for Vanuatu. We are absolutely determined to make sure that we can continue that friendship and strength. I had a great deal of pride to stand and meet with you and your delegation this morning in the forecourt of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . It's an honour afforded our most special friends and guests, and it was extended to you by way of decision of the Prime Minister. That demonstrates, I think, the level of respect that we have for you, personally. I want to say thank you very much for your work as Deputy Prime Minister and for the way in which you were able to work with us. During my time as Minister for Defence we signed an agreement. We had very important business to conduct in a contested region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last night, many of us here attended a fine speech given by Ambassador Yamagami at the Japanese residence, followed by a fine speech by the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for trade and others who were there—former prime ministers Morrison and Abbott. It demonstrated the links in our region and the desire for closer cooperation and relationships. That was on display last night as it has been today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I extend every welcome to you, and we look forward very much to strengthening and deepening the relationship in many bilateral ways, such as our work during the course of COVID. I pay tribute to former prime minister Morrison. You were kind enough in our bilateral meeting today to raise the issue of the vaccines that Australia was able to provide to your country, which provided support in a very difficult period for your country and for the world of course. It was instinctive that we would provide that support. We were determined to see that support delivered in a timely way, and that is what transpired.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, again, for being here and for making the effort to travel to our country. All Australians look forward at any opportunity to visiting you in Vanuatu. I give a shout-out on behalf of the commerce minister. To all of those Australians looking at booking a holiday: make sure you start googling Vanuatu straightaway. Thank you so much.
