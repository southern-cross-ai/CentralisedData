       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Does the minister accept that Taji Mustafa, a leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir, is a member of a political movement directed towards non-peaceful overthrow of another government, such as Israel's military destruction, or that holds extremist views that are both proscribed grounds to deny Mr Mustafa's visa on public-interest grounds under the character test, under his discretion, in section 501 of the Migration Act?

         Order! I am hesitating because I have been reading—as we have been going along—not in respect of the question but rule 101C(ii), 'questions critical of the character or conduct of other persons must be in writing.' That refers to anybody being asked a question before the parliament. I was hesitating before the Leader of the House got to his feet because I felt that the question was in breach of that standing order.

          Madam Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: notwithstanding the fact that the minister for immigration has indicated he is certainly willing to answer the question, I am concerned, as Leader of the House, about this. There is a reason we have a standing order on asking for legal opinions in the House.

            Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order on the two points that have been raised: one by yourself and one by the Leader of the House. In terms of dealing with the one from the Leader of the House, the minister is not being asked for a legal opinion, he is being asked why he has not acted within his own powers and his own discretion. In terms of your concern, if your concern were followed through for all questions and answers, Madam Deputy Speaker, but particularly questions, then virtually no question about the opposition or

                I am very happy to take that question from the member for Cook. It goes to my powers under the Migration Act in relation to the character test and the public-interest test. In relation to that test I refer the honourable member to my previous answer, which outlined the fact that this is not a proscribed organisation. In relation to the views of that individual, every member of this House would have very strong views about the position taken by that individual.

                   In relation to the minister's personal powers, these are to be exercised appropriately and carefully. For the information of the House, I have personally considered the character test on 38 occasions during my time as minister for immigration and on 27 of those occasions I have taken the decision to cancel or refuse a visa. It is a parallel exercise with due care and diligence and the member for Cook might like to get a reminder from the member for Menzies about what happens when a minister does not do that.
