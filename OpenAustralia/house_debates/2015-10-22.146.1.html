        Only a few hours out of Kokoda stoically stand four black granite pillars, each with a single word: courage, mateship, sacrifice and endurance. It was at Isurava in 1942 that the Australian troops faced the Japanese imperial force in a brutal campaign where many Australians, Japanese and Papuans lost their lives. It was on 24 August that Private

         Bruce Kingsbury
        </a>
        courageously sacrificed his own life in the defence of his mates and the protection of our nation. Private Kingsbury was in fact our first serviceman to receive the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        in an Australian territory, a true hero and a custodian of the Anzac spirit but quite simply a man—a man who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of our country and for the peace we now all enjoy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Long had I felt drawn to Kokoda, perhaps to better understand my own family and my grandfather Warrant Officer Leslie Allan, who served in the

        in the early sixties, and in some part to have a better and deeper understanding of our connection to the Anzacs and the Anzac spirit and what the Anzacs truly did for us. However, my trip to Kokoda in September was as a part of and a participant in the young women's youth leadership program brought together by Panthers on the Prowl to teach those four pillars of courage, mateship, sacrifice and endurance to six young women in my electorate.

        These six young women were year 11 students from six local high schools:

        We stretched the girls both physically and mentally, and at the same time, exposed them to concentrated mentorship from successful women in their community. The tangible realisation of the ultimate price our soldiers paid was also very evident within the group.

        I have learnt to appreciate all the simple things in life. I have definitely come back with a stronger mindset, at training if I'm finding something tough I sit and think I pushed through this pain on the track I can accomplish this, if I put my mind to it I can achieve anything I believe.

        The lessons I've learnt along the way, such as just how resilient I can be, and the connections I've made will be with me for the rest of my life. I believe everyone should have the opportunity to learn more about Australia's history, and walk in the footsteps of some of our bravest soldiers.

        My Kokoda trip was amazing!

       <p class="italic">
        I met some amazing people who have become lifelong friends and some amazing and inspirational woman. This trip for me was a trip of self conquer and self proof of what I am capable of.

        Our group started and finished as a team; no one was more equal than the other.

        I felt that this trip was like a kaleidoscope - extreme highs, some personal lows but learnt the true meaning of camaraderie. No matter what challenges we faced, we supported each other and faced it as one.

        Even though I was in a foreign country, the people were beautiful, friendly and encouraging which leant towards my understanding of my country's war history and the unique relationship we have with

       <p class="italic">
        It's hard to explain the difficulty of Kokoda as it is also hard to describe the impacts of the trail on myself. As of all the lessons I've learnt, challenges I faced, I've found self discipline is what I adapted to best.
       </p>
       <p>
        For all the girls and, I know, for all of us, I do not know who were the mentors, them or us.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think perhaps the most poignant moment of the entire trip was standing at the war cemetery at

        with Major Charlie Lynn. He faced the girls towards the graves. He asked the girls to think of the sacrifice of Private Bruce Kingsbury. When they think of things in their life and things get tough, he asked them to think of sacrifice, courage, mateship and endurance and then ask themselves, 'What would Bruce Kingsbury do?'
