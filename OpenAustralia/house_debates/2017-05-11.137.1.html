        The Maclean Show was held last week, and what better person to officially open the show than
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Watson" rel="nofollow">
         Joyce Watson
        </a>
        . Joyce is 93 years old and has been involved in the show for most of her life. At an early age, she competed in the equestrian events, later becoming a judge and competitor in the pavilion. She is also the show's longest serving secretary, from between 1971 and 1997. Joyce still enters exhibits in the pavilion and this year she beat her daughter to claim the crown of crochet champion. Her family's involvement also includes her twin daughters, Narelle Phelps and Cheryl Watson, granddaughters Tina Ross, Tracey Moran and Leanda Phelps and great-grandchildren Shannon, Jarrad and Abi Moran, all continuing the wonderful family tradition.

        I would also like to congratulate the winner and entrants of the Miss Showgirl competition. The entrants of the Senior Miss Showgirl were Colbie Cameron and Taneal McConnell, along with the winner, Nicole Cowling.
