        Amongst all the real issues that people are facing in the Longman community and, indeed, around Australia, with a housing, cost-of-living and domestic violence crisis, I am so proud that amongst all the darkness, doom and gloom there are lights shining and giving hope, with so many not-for-profit, charitable and faith based organisations in the Longman community standing up and helping those in need. I've always believed that these organisations are best equipped to assist those doing it tough in our community, as they are local and understand our unique needs best. They are staffed and run primarily by volunteers, who provide help to others out of a genuine desire to help their neighbour, not because it's a job.
       </p>

        Just this year I've seen five new organisations arise to assist in feeding the homeless. Most are run out of local churches, and it's great to see the church community and other community groups providing real, practical support to those in need. This Sunday it'll be my honour to attend the opening of Eat 4
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets" rel="nofollow">
         The Streets
        </a>
        in Centenary Lakes in Caboolture, yet another new organisation that will supply food, by way of a free community barbecue at lunchtime on Saturdays not just for the homeless but also for those doing it tough. They are also working on an exciting new initiative that will provide an app and a website that advises people of the various locations people can obtain help to receive a meal and, in some cases, groceries.
       </p>
       <p>
        This app and website will make it so much easier for those people who are already stressed due to their circumstances to contact such organisations as: Caboolture Community Action, which provides hampers and runs an op shop to provide household goods, including furniture and homewares; Churches of Christ in Caboolture and Rivers Church in Kallangur, which provide over 200 grocery hampers per week;

        </a>
        , which has a community pantry in Burpengary and a monthly barbecue on Saturdays at lunchtime; Hope Point Church in Moodlu, which runs a mobile kitchen in Caboolture on Thursday nights, feeding the homeless; Global Care and Freedom Church, both of which provide hampers and groceries on

        ; and Emerge Church in Morayfield, which provides hampers, does a cook-up and feeds the homeless on a Monday night.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so proud to represent a community with such a generous spirit and culture, that wants to help others and give up our most precious commodity, which is time. Thank you to every volunteer who stands at a barbecue, delivers furniture, packs a hamper or drives to collect food for hampers. You are truly unsung heroes who make a difference. Congratulations to Michael and his team at Eat 4 The Streets. I welcome you to our wonderful community and wish you all the best with your endeavours. Thank you for what you will do in our community in the future.
