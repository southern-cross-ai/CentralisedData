       <p>
        One of the proudest days for me as a member of the federal parliament and the Labor team was the day when we recommitted our efforts towards reduction of global warming. This side of the House is serious. We are not climate change denialists on this side of the House, and that is reflected in my electorate of Lalor. When I talk to young people in my electorate and ask them what they think the country's priorities are, global warming is right up there at No. 1. Young people across my electorate care about this, and they care about it because they hear their parents talking about it. Those opposite are really in danger of becoming yesterday's menâ€”and, yes, I meant men. They are really in danger of completely losing touch with the Australian electorate when it comes to this issue. They should all commit, with Labor, to the National Energy Guarantee that they designed. It is their policy. They should go back to their party room today and not talk about leadership for a change but perhaps have a conversation about the peril the planet's in and how young people care about this issue. In fact, they care enough to go out on the streets and strike. As a former teacher, I fully support those young people expressing their opinion in the streets of our nation.
