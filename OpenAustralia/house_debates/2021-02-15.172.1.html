        The City of Mitcham's Active Citizenship award went to the Big A Charity shop in Hawthorn. Selling fresh produce from their community garden and second-hand bargains for over 20 years, the shop provides a welcoming atmosphere for many in the community who regularly stop by for a coffee and a chat.

        Along the coast, the City of Holdfast Bay's Young Citizen of the Year award went to Lori Chandler. A member of the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club, Lori not only coaches athletes from ages five to 60; she has also worked hard to increase female retention at surf clubs. Through her effort she established the Girls at Seacliff committee within the club, which looks at ways to better engage with female members.
       </p>
       <p>
        The City of Holdfast Bay's Active Citizenship award this year went to Emma Sandery for her contributions to our local community. Emma established the Seacliff Community Produce Swap, where local residents can come together to swap excess home-grown produce. Emma has also created a 'Buy Nothing' Facebook group which encourages people to share, swap, give away or lend items for free to prevent them going to landfill.

        The City of Holdfast Bay's Community Event of the Year award went to Sarah Tinney for her Marilyn Jetty Swim. Participating in a bike and jetty classic for the seventh year, a group of adventurous women and some men dressed up from head to toe as

        . Over 300 Marilyns took the plunge for this year's classic, which took place earlier this month. They hoped to raise $100,000 this year, but Sarah and the Marilyns truly went above and beyond and blew that target out of the water; they have so far raised over $160,000.

Not only was this the most pennants won by any club; they did so while fielding just five teamsâ€”an incredible success rate. The winning teams were: Wednesday Division 4
