        The life of Kylie Facer OAM changed after the birth of her first child, Anika, seven years ago. Anika suffered seizures following her birth and was taken from Newcastle Private to the

         John Hunter Hospital

        neonatal intensive care unit, where tests showed she had suffered a stroke. Her parents were told that she had suffered severe brain damage and to basically take her home as there was no rehab or treatment suitable for a child of her age. Fortunately, they were connected to the Cerebral Palsy Alliance and that changed their lives, with Anika receiving early intervention and therapies. The complete lack of resources for families like hers prompted Kylie to seek out others in a similar situation, which led her to Dee Banks, whose daughter also suffered a stroke. Together, they founded Little Stroke Warriors in 2017. This organisation links families from across
