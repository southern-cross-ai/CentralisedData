        Today I want to recognise Harry Scope
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JP" rel="nofollow">
         JP
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateau_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Bateau Bay
        </a>
        , who is 96 and has been a justice of the peace for 53 years. Harry's service was recognised on Saturday at the state conference of the New South Wales Justices Association, held in my electorate at Mingara. As patron of the Tuggerah Lakes branch of the New South Wales Justices Association and as a fellow JP, I was invited to welcome guests to the conference. Harry was recognised for his dedicated service by His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         Governor of New South Wales
        </a>
        . Over the years, Harry has been a plumber, a motor engineer and a salesman, but this has not stopped him from pioneering the JP community desk and helping out in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         The Entrance
        </a>
        and Wyong with volunteer policing. It was on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        that the first JP community desk in New South Wales was established. We have now eight such desks in our area, and there are more than 130 across the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        JPs give so much to their communities. In my experience, JPs are always willing to lend a hand, are happy to put in the hard yards and are available to provide professional services to those who need them when they need them most. It is a very special achievement to be able to do so in such a consistent and lasting way, as Harry Scope JP has done. On Saturday, Harry said, 'I've enjoyed every moment of the job I'm doing, and I hope it will be a long time before I give it up.' Congratulations, Harry, and thank you for your service. Congratulations also to conference coordinator and director, Bruce Gibbs JP, for bringing the conference to the Central Coast this weekend.
