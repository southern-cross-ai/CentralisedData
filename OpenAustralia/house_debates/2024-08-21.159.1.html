        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability was an enormous undertaking of 4½ years and an important and vital piece of work. Almost 10,000 people shared their experiences through almost 8,000 submissions and 32 public hearings, and the evidence was shocking.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Adelaide, we've had some shocking, well-known cases where people have died in terrible situations. One particularly well-known and horrific case, which made the media and resulted in convictions, is every person with disability's nightmare and every family's and carer's nightmare. Her family had set her up well. She had a trust fund. She had a home that was owned freehold. Yet, following the death of her parents, she was neglected by paid providers. She was literally left to rot in a chair in her living room, unable to get to the toilet or feed herself. Her money and her possessions, including jewellery, were stolen from her, and she died an horrific death.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a carer, as a parent, as someone who has a caring responsibility for a person with a disability, as someone who gets around in the disability sector, I can tell you that our biggest fear is that, despite every effort to uphold the dignity, the rights and the safety of people with disability, this could happen. So I'd really like to thank the 10,000 people who told their stories and shared their experience, their knowledge and their ideas. Sadly but necessarily, they also shared their experiences of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. This was hard to hear, but it's vital information. Lived-experience evidence is the most important. It ground-truths the other evidence. So hearing from all those people—people with disability, their carers, their families, their advocates—has informed the 222 recommendations that range from safety and human rights to inclusion and access to mainstream services like health and education.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recommendations cover multiple portfolios and all levels of government. Of these recommendations, 172 are the sole or joint responsibility of the Commonwealth. Of these, 130 have been accepted or accepted in principle. 'Accepted in principle' means the policy intent of the recommendation has been accepted, and I want to reassure the disability community that we have heard them and we have listened. We are taking action and we are committed to driving real change across all aspects of society. We are committed to the vision, set out in the royal commission report, of a future:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … where people with disability live free from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation; where human rights are protected; and individuals live with dignity, equality and respect and can fulfil their potential … where people with and without disability:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The response to the royal commission is a joint response of all Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It provides a clear commitment that all levels of government are working together and that we will work in partnership with people with disability to determine the most appropriate and impactful way to implement reform in response to the recommendations. There are 36 recommendations that require further consideration because they relate to ongoing or recently concluded inquiries or negotiation, or require further consideration in consultation with people with disability. There are six recommendations that are noted, and there are a further 50 that fall entirely within the responsibility of state or territory governments—so a response will need to come from those governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a federal government, we will continue to be accountable for the progress of those recommendations that are our joint or sole responsibility through six-monthly reporting on the implementation progress. However, as a government, we have not waited for the final report of the disability royal commission to take action to improve the lives of Australians with disability. Our $371 million commitment towards the first phase of the response to the disability royal commission builds on over $3 billion over the last three budgets to improve the lives and safety of people with disability in Australia. We are taking action through the four key pillars that reflect the areas the disability community told us are important to them—better safeguarding, promoting inclusion and accessibility, upholding human rights and recognising the unique perspectives and experiences of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Implementing and embedding our shared vision for an inclusive Australia requires a sustained national effort from all Australian governments. This Australian government commits to strengthening safeguards, independent oversight and complaint mechanisms. We commit to listening to the diverse voices of people with disability and working in partnership to design, implement and evaluate policies and programs that drive reform. We commit to upholding the human rights of people with disability to enable them to live with dignity, equality and respect. And this Australian government commits to promoting a more inclusive society where people with disability feel they belong so that they are respected, valued and able to fully contribute.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our focus is on fixing problems, but not just that; our focus is also on creating a better future where people with disability are valued, respected and supported to live their lives with dignity.
