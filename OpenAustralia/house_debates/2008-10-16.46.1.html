        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer advise the House what he expects to be the ultimate size of the contingent liability to the taxpayer of the government’s 100 per cent guarantee for bank wholesale funding?

         The Prime Minister and I have indicated that MYEFO, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, will be produced in the next month, and those contingent liabilities will be contained in those documents. They will be contained in those documents, as is usual practice. MYEFO is a very important document. I think I remarked in the House yesterday that the practice of the previous Treasurer was to deliver it at a time when people were not around, just before Christmas.

              Ten of the opposition’s MYEFOs when they were in government were released more than six months after the budget. I remember the day well; everybody had left Canberra. There are people up there who remember it as well because it was the day on which the former Treasurer reneged on their promise in terms of the childcare rebate. They decided to publish it just before Christmas so nobody would notice they were going to make families wait two years for their childcare cash rebate.

                    She says, ‘Why not now?’ Because it is being prepared by the Treasury. We will deliver it earlier than it was delivered by them on at least 10 occasions, because that is the responsible thing to do. The responsible thing to do is deliver it in a measured and considered way. All of that data which is being asked for by those opposite will be there for all to see. But what is all this about? To hide their embarrassment they are trying to walk both sides of the street. They are trying to pretend they support the package and then they are trying to nitpick at it around the edges all the way through because they do not support it and because they do not want to stand up for the national interest. We have taken a decision to get ahead of the game by strengthening our economy, because of what is occurring in the international economy. If those opposite cannot understand what is going on in the international economy, given all of the events in the United States, in Europe and in the emerging economies, then they simply do not get it.
