        might ring a bell with some of my colleagues as the home town of the former member for Farrer Tim Fischer. This small village also provides an example of the flooding emergency so many of my communities faced on the weekend before last, which is why I ask this government to do more, by providing emergency financial assistance through an Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. This is the $1,000 Centrelink payment which can be made at the discretion of the Commonwealth in the event of a major disaster having a significant impact on individuals.

        Any way you look at this, it is a major disaster. I am going to Boree Creek on Saturday for a fundraising barbecue at the local Rural Fire Service. We really thank that captain, Col Richens, for his actions the other night, but I am wondering what to tell the people when I meet them and they ask me, 'What is the federal government actually going to do to assist us?' I am hoping that before week's end the Attorney-General will have given me the answer.
