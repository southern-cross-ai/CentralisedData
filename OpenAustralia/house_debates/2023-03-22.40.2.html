        For a number of years, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamborine_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Tamborine Mountain
        </a>
        Medical Practice has been working with my office to seek a sensible resolution to the introduction of Modified Monash Model healthcare boundaries, which has had a number of unintended consequences across Australia, including on Tamborine Mountain. The introduction of this new classification has seen our regional mountain community in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        hinterland classified as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MM" rel="nofollow">
         MM
        </a>
        1, or as a major city. Therefore, medical practices on the mountain have had to compete for doctors with Brisbane and Gold Coast practices that have not been able to recruit overseas general practitioners. The mountain is simply seeking that the classification of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MM1" rel="nofollow">
         MM1
        </a>
        be reconsidered given the unique aspects of the community, including remoteness, distance from medical services and the regional nature of the town.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to report to the House that yesterday I had a very productive meeting with the Minister for Health and Aged Care. I thank him and his senior adviser for hearing our cause. My office, along with the Tamborine Mountain Medical Practice, will now be working closely with the minister and his office to find sensible resolutions to this unintended consequence of the Modified Monash Model. In 2019 there were 20 doctors; there are now eight. In closing, I thank the practice for their unwavering advocacy and work on this issue over a number of years. I look forward to reporting back to the House in the near future on the progress of this issue.
