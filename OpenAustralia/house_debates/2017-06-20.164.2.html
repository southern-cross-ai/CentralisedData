       <p>
        I rise in this place to stand up for veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families in the electorate of Herbert. Herbert is the home to the largest
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        presence in Australia, and as such, owing to our great lifestyle and weather, we are also home to a large number of veterans, ex-service personnel and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have lived in Townsville all of my life, apart from 3.5 years, and I have watched
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

        grow from quite a small barracks to the huge facility that it is today. Lavarack celebrated its 50th birthday in the second half of last year. I have also watched the

        base grow over the years. It has been a fixture in our community since World War II. As a citizen of Townsville, I have seen the significant contribution that Defence personnel have made to our community across a range of areas. Both of my grandfathers served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        in World War II. One of my grandfathers did not live past 54 years of age, as he suffered a heart attack and was found dead at work. My maternal grandfather was severely affected by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        , as it is now known, and he did not receive any help for this debilitating condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of my work over 15 years as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of one of the largest mental health community organisations in north and west Queensland, I am very aware of the issues our veterans and ex-service personnel face. Throughout my time working in the community mental health sector I often thought with some sadness that my grandfather's life would have been so much better if he had received treatment and support to manage his PTSD.

        Throughout my life working in the community mental health sector I often thought with some sadness that my grandfather's life would have been so much better if he had received treatment and support to manage his PTSD. Therefore, as the newly elected member for Herbert, I am passionate about standing up for our ADF members, veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. I am determined that the men and women who give so selflessly of themselves to ensure that we can experience the freedoms that we live each and every day get the support and services that they truly deserve. I am also determined that their families will also be supported, as they too make sacrifices on the home front for our freedoms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me share some facts about the veteran and ex-service population in my community. According to the 2017
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        statistics, my electorate of Herbert is home to 4,419 veterans, with an average age of 49.75 years. Add to this 1,238 dependants, and that is a total of 5,651 people. I will say it again: these men and women have selflessly put their lives on the line in order to protect the freedom and democracy that we experience in Australia today. In my electorate there are 1,813 special rate disability pensioners, with an average age of 61.74 years. There are 1,198 service pensioners, with an average age of 70.82 years. There is a Veterans' Entitlements Act pensioner population of 2,827, with an average age of 66.73 years. There are 1,521 gold card holders, with an average age of 69.4 years, and 1,784 white card holders, with an average age of 48.48 years, making a treatment population of 3,305, with an average age of 58.11.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to ensure that I am getting a genuine and clearly articulated perspective from veterans, ex-service personnel and families, I have formed the Townsville Community Veterans Reference Group. This group is made up of currently serving personnel, a diverse range of veterans organisations, family representatives and mental health representatives, including from the Northern Queensland Primary Health Network. The reference group immediately commenced work on preparing for the Turnbull government's veterans suicide prevention trial. The group worked with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHN" rel="nofollow">
         PHN
        </a>
        to establish the steering group, which is chaired by Lieutenant General John Caligari (Retired), and developed the job description for the trial project officer. The steering committee participated in the recruitment of the project officer. The steering committee has been meeting and working in collaboration with NQPHN for a couple of months.
       </p>
       <p>
        This activity has been supported by the NQPHN, as the government was missing in action throughout this process. Last week I had the opportunity to ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs questions during consideration in detail about the Townsville trial. Sadly, the answers were not forthcoming. My major concern, given nearly a year has passed since the announcement and no funding has been delivered, is: will Townsville actually get a three-year trial funded for two years, or will the government extend the trial for a year and hand over the third year of funding?
       </p>
       <p>
        Another major issue that has been raised during discussion at the reference group meeting is the opportunity for veterans and ex-service personnel, male or female, to get a good, meaningful job. This is particularly important for the younger personnel. Dignity of work is a human right, and there is no substitute for the great feeling of having something to get out of bed for every day and contributing to the community in which you live. Meaning and purpose is so important in one's life.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 17 November the Prime Minister and Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced the formation of an industry advisory committee to address veterans employment. However, it was revealed in Senate estimates that the cornerstone of the Prime Minister's Veteran's Employment Program, the industry advisory committee, does not yet exist. It seems that 3Â½ months after the announcement there were no members on the advisory committee, showing once again that the Turnbull government is great at making announcements but the follow-through is just not there.
       </p>
       <p>
        To add insult to injury, the Turnbull government's Veteran's Employment Program confirmed in Senate estimates that there are no agreed targets to measure increased opportunities for veterans and service personnel in the jobs program. Without program targets it is not possible to measure and evaluate the outcomes or success of the program. Labor will always be supportive of measures that provide greater support for our veterans. Targets are crucial in order to evaluate the success of the program in terms of outcomes delivered. The government must also provide indicators and benchmarks for industry in order to ensure that funding for this program is aligned with veteran, ex-service personnel and community expectations. Instead, the responsibility has once again been passed on by the Turnbull government to industry. When will the government take responsibility and ownership for the announcements that they make? Veterans employment is a key part of a successful transition from life in the ADF to life in the community, and government must ensure that any funding is linked to measurable outcomes and targets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, the defence groups in Townsville are leading the charge. The defence community and industry have come together and are working proactively and collaboratively on this very important issue, and they are well on their way to success. Veterans, ex-service personnel and their families deserve to know that there is a long-term commitment to safe transition from the ADF to community life and that the government is supporting that. Judging by the government's track record, this is not too good right now, but veterans, ex-service personnel and families can rest assured that Labor does value the work of our Defence personnel and we will pick up where this government has dropped the ball.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am fighting for veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families living in the electorate of Herbert because they deserve to have access to quality services and support in their time of need and the opportunity to achieve meaningful and purposeful employment. Veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families need to know that government announcements will translate into real dollars. I can assure them that Labor is committed and on their side. Our nation relies on these brave men and women and it is about time that this government reciprocated and offered them what they most certainly deserveâ€”that is, quality services and support.
