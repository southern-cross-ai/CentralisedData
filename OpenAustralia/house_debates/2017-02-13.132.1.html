       <p>
        I am very pleased today to speak about the tropical town of Carnarvon, in my electorate of Durack. As I have said in this chamber on many occasions, Carnarvon is home to beautiful weather and delicious fruit, not forgetting the vegetables, as well as being on the doorstep of some of Australia's best natural beauty, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningaloo_Reef" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Kennedy Range.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of this government's hallmarks—unlike Labor—is its support for and development of regional, rural and remote Australia. Right throughout the Gascoyne, this federal government has led a number of significant developments, including improved mobile phone reception through the Mobile Black Spot Program, which has led to a commitment of several new mobile phone towers in the region in locations such as the

        and the Point Quobba blowholes. Tourists in Carnarvon will recognise those locations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upgrades to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West" rel="nofollow">
         North West
        </a>
        Coastal Highway and Australia's defence base at Learmonth are other important developments that this government has made in this very, very important and beautiful part of Australia. More good news is that in the second half of this year
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        construction will start in Carnarvon, creating faster internet for residents and businesses in the town and nearby regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the federal member for Carnarvon and also the Gascoyne, I am determined to ensure that Durack continues to have more aged-care places across the breadth of Durack. We need to work harder to ensure that regional Australians have the opportunity to age at home rather than being shipped off to the cities, Deputy Speaker—but I am not telling you anything that you do not already know. Last month I had the great honour of announcing 14 new aged-care places in Carnarvon, which will make a profound impact on the lives of the senior residents and their families. This has been a long time coming. Make no bones about it: these 14 places are wholly funded by the federal government as result of my advocacy and the good work of Minister Wyatt.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is worth noting that it is not just the federal Liberals who are delivering in the town.

        -led state government is committing nearly $65 million for the amalgamation of the current school facilities, which will see kindergarten through to year 12 offered on one campus. Of course, this important decision might be at risk if Labor were to win the WA state election next month.
       </p>
       <p>
        The region will, however, greatly benefit with the state representation of Julee Westcott, who is the Liberal candidate for the North West Central seat. Julee is part of the furniture in the North West, having lived and worked in the Gascoyne for many years. I look forward to Julee winning this seat and to working with her, as she will be another strong female regional Liberal voice in the state parliament.
