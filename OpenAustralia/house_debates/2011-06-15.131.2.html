        I suggest that the order for the consideration of proposed expenditures agreed to by the House previously be varied so that we consider the proposed expenditure for the following portfolios after the Attorney-General's portfolio this afternoon: firstly, the foreign affairs segment of the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio; secondly, the workplace relations and

        segment of the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio; and, thirdly, the tertiary education and skills and school education, early childhood and youth segments of the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio.

          Can the minister make it clear whether the opposition whips and the shadow ministers have been notified of this variation? If they have not then I do not see we are in any sort of position to agree to that.

           I cannot assure the Main Committee of that one way or the other. It is a reasonable question. I have stood up and moved this proposition on the basis that we have. I am happy to check that and come back to this proposition. It would see five portfolios be considered in detail up until about 5 pm, so I am happy to get that assurance and get back.

            The minister has not moved anything. He has made a suggestion. The minister has agreed that he will obtain the information sought by the member for Boothby. On that basis, I think we proceed with the program we currently have. If the Main Committee chooses to accept the minister's suggestion subsequently, that is exactly what we will do.

               The first point that must be made is that this is a minister who is running and hiding. This is a minister who refuses to front this Committee, as would normally be the case, and clearly it is as a direct result of the hypocrisy of the minister overnight. It is an indication that this minister is embarrassed by having misled the Australian public. This is a minister who, whilst saying one thing publicly and leading the Australian public to believe that she was taking a certain course of action, has done something quite different in private. This is a minister who, while she was saying to the Australian public that it is bad to solicit donations from tobacco companies, was privately writing to these companies seeking those same donations.

                 This is a broad-ranging debate. However, I would point out to the member for Dickson, and I thought this was the point that was going to be made by the member for Fowler, that he ought not reflect on the minister other than by a substantive motion.

                     My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Health and other matters. It relates to that part of the portfolio where there is direct expenditure on tobacco campaigns. In reference to that particular measure undertaken by the government, has the minister sought donations from or had contact with tobacco companies since the 2004 declaration of the then Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party would undertake no such activity?

                     <p>
                      You ask me about tobacco initiatives under the budget, which I am happy to respond to. We are expanding in excess of $100 million on tobacco initiatives for Aboriginal and
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
                       Torres Strait
                      </a>
                      Islander Australians. We understand, as I am sure you do, that cutting tobacco consumption rates amongst Aboriginal and
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
                       Torres Strait Islander
                      </a>
                      people is an absolute must. Around 50 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people smoke compared to around 16.7 per cent of the general population. If we are to actually close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander life expectancy, it is imperative that we actually get people off smokes. That requires us doing a range of things. One of those is that we have employed a national Indigenous tobacco coordinator, Tom Calma, to oversee the implementation of our program. We have involved tobacco action workers in 57 regions across Australia and tobacco action coordinators. Their job is to work with the communities to try to, firstly, make people aware of the issues to do with tobacco consumption and its impact upon their health and the health of their communities and, secondly, ensure that they take action to reduce their own smoking rates.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that this is no easy task. I know the member opposite is actually interested in this subject, so let me take him to more detail. You know and I know that the diseases associated with tobacco consumption lead to a lot shorter life expectancy amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians through vascular disease, diabetes, heart disease and cancer—the sorts of things that we know kill people. I make no apologies, and I am hoping from the shadow minister's question that he is supporting these initiatives. I assume he is. It is very important, as I say, if we are to close the gap in life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the rest of the community that we address these sorts of issues.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I know that the member has got a fixation with tobacco companies and I understand that. I am not interested in tobacco companies in this debate. What am I keen on doing is getting consumption rates of tobacco down amongst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. We have an objective of halving tobacco consumption rates amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community Australians by the end of the decade. If we can do that, that will make a substantial difference to their life expectancy. If we were to be able to bring down the tobacco consumption rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to what the rest of the population currently is, less than 17 per cent, then it is asserted that we would make a material difference across the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community of increasing life expectancy between four and five years. That would have a material impact upon the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.

                           Australians. The member should know that we are investing in this budget $1.2 billion in 2011-12 compared to what they did in their last budget in 2006-07, $0.5 billion. This is a substantial growth in investment and we expect to get concrete outcomes from that investment. The government has continued funding of $39.1 million over four years for projects to assist stolen generations. But significantly, going back to the issue that was raised by the shadow minister, we are absolutely focused on bringing down tobacco consumption rates amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Do you want to have a discussion about what we are doing to address Aboriginal—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker—

I have been very pleased about this, because my electorate, in the outer suburbs of Adelaide, has had significant investment since this government got elected. Under the previous government, it was completed neglected, I have to say, and there was no investment, but under this government we have seen significant investments. Most recently, I am very pleased that it has been announced that there will be a Headspace unit at Noarlunga, which will really address mental health issues in the local southern suburbs of Adelaide. What is great about these Headspace sites is that they bring everyone into one tent: physical health professionals, mental health professionals and employment services, providing a holistic approach. In this budget, there is mental health funding of $2.2 billion, a significant investment. I am pleased that the Minister for

He made a mistake because he got on radio accusing the state government of delaying the GP Plus Super Clinic. I have got good news for the Member of Boothby: there will be no such delays in Kingston. I am very pleased to inform him—I am disappointed he is not here, because he did make that mistake on radio—that it is full steam ahead, with stage 1 already open and stage 2 being constructed. This is another example of this government's significant investment in health.

                                                    In addition, we are investing a lot in training new GPs and clinicians, whether they be nurses or allied health people. I am very pleased that the final stage at Flinders hospital at the Noarlunga centre is open for the training of more GPs. That was something that the previous government really neglected. They put a cap on GPs. Their only strategy really was to provide golf balls to GPs to try and train more. I am not really sure what their strategy was with the golf balls, but certainly it did not work. The golf balls were somehow meant to encourage GPs. The minister has a good example of that—they were not even all used. That did not work.

I know that Flinders has also extended into some very sophisticated training facilities at

Darwin is one of the places where, previously, the patients had to fly to Adelaide but now they have an integrated cancer service in their local area. But a focus of this government has been on prevention. Previously, very little attention was paid to prevention, but this government has put a real focus on prevention. Obviously, the Gillard government has extended funding for the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. My question to the minister is: could the minister advise how this program will improve the detection and prevention of bowel cancer?

                                                     I thank the member for Kingston for her concise, punchy question and for her ongoing advocacy of the health needs of the southern suburbs of Adelaide. I have had many a discussion with the member for Kingston about the health needs of southern Adelaide. She has been a strong supporter of the mental health reform process. I greatly appreciated her counsel and advice, as one of the very few, if not the only, professional psychologist in this parliament. Her advice about the better targeting of primary care services and youth mental health services was incredibly valuable to me in developing the package that was presented at the last budget.

I was at the sod turning some time ago with the member for Kingston and the South Australian Minister for Health. The southern suburbs of Adelaide are one of the 10 areas where a new headspace service will be built during this year. I want to pay tribute particularly to the southern GP division down there, which I have dealt with on many occasions. It is an incredibly professional outfit and I know that it will play a very central role in the development of the headspace service there.

We know that of the more than $100 billion that is spent in this country on health every year, only about two per cent is spent of prevention and the vast bulk of that on immunisation programs. That is why we have set up the Preventive Health Agency, which finally passed through the parliament. That is why we agreed with

We know that prevention and early intervention not only is much better for patients but also relieves a larger cost impact on the healthcare system later on if things are not picked up early.

                                                     The government's National Bowel Cancer Screening Program is a wonderful example of that approach. We know that bowel cancer kills almost 4,000 Australians every year, the second highest cancer killer in this country. We also know, though, that less than 40 per cent of bowel cancers are detected early, maximising the opportunities for treatment, intervention and therefore recovery. In 2008, as the member for Kingston well knows, there was an allocation in that budget of over $87.4 million over three years, offering free screening for up to 2.5 million Australians who turned 50, 55 and 65 years of age between 2008 and 2010. In 2008, that screening program led to 120 bowel cancer cases being detected, along with 334 suspected cancers and more than 5,000 potentially precancerous conditions also being detected.

Approximately 3.4 million Australians will be offered free screening over the next four years through that program. The program intends to commence sending out invitations in July this year—next month—to people turning 50, 55 or 65 from 1 January this year. I thank the member for Kingston for her ongoing interest in health reform and her interest in this program in particular.

I wanted to understand some of the numbers around that program. First of all, which of the 12 participants from last year are involved this year or have followed up and are participating in community support and inspiration of local people in their communities? Why does this year's squad contain a bachelor of construction management, a bachelor of marketing, an Indigenous liaison officer from a university and a third-year environmental engineering student? Are these individuals who need the inspiration to run a marathon and deliver changes for their community? How many of these have undertaken certificate qualifications? It is our understanding that none have, either from this year or last year. Do they intend to make a certificate a compulsory part of that program?

If there is evidence to support sending people to an overseas footrace rather than a local one—some of the largest footraces in the world are held here, such as the third largest triathlon in the world—then I would like to be directed to those resources. Lastly, why is that money a better expenditure for Indigenous wellbeing than the Lillawan study phase 2, of half a million dollars, to look after

A decision was taken to defer them in the context of the government's fiscal position and our commitment to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13. Even within those fiscal parameters, though, the government has been completely definite about our position that we will list medicines to treat serious and life-threatening conditions. The only deferrals that have taken place have been in areas where there is an alternative medication. We continue to take a proactive approach to listing on the PBS PBAC recommendations for medicines that deal with serious and life-threatening conditions.

I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank Minister Butler for his frequent visits to Newcastle and his wonderful delivery on mental health services. I also take this opportunity to thank Minister Snowden, who is sitting beside me, for his attendance at a national Indigenous men's health forum in my electorate. I know how much it is appreciated that our interest in the health of the Indigenous population is genuine and that we have delivered great outcomes. Also worthy of mention are the achievements of Parliamentary Secretary Catherine King, who is also in the chamber, on the organ donation program. I also note that the member for Shortland joined with me just recently in my electorate to announce one of the first Medicare Locals, and that is something we take great pride in.

All of us have been touched by cancer in some way, with 88,000 Australians diagnosed with cancer each year and 35,000 dying from cancer each year. In the four years before the federal Labor government was elected in 2007 we had campaigned long and hard for attention to be given to our scanning and imaging equipment but we were ignored by the then health minister,

We were pleased and privileged to have a PET scanner, but it had been bought by the specialists themselves and was being funded by the specialists themselves. It was not until Labor was elected that the positron emission tomography scheme was funded for a Medicare licence, and then, in a follow-up budget, $1½ million was invested to upgrade services—to buy the necessary radiopharmaceuticals, increase the shielding equipment and purchase another PET scanner.

We had been waiting for that machine to be installed and I am very pleased that in this budget the minister was able to partially fund a new Medicare licence under a regional health program. So my question to the minister is: can you outline the ways that access to important MRI diagnostic services was included in the budget—those services that will help diagnose conditions such as cancer—and how this is reforming access to MRI services right across the nation?

There were some particularly passionate carers at the forum who gave me some very valuable insights into the ways that they and the family members for whom they are caring interact with emergency departments in hospitals in particular. That is why one of the focuses of the mental health reform package outlined in this year's budget, supported by a $200 million reform fund from the Commonwealth, is to engage with the states about ways in which the experience of people with severe mental illness and their carers presenting at emergency departments can be improved. I took a lot from the Newcastle session about that issue, and it was very important in terms of us developing that position to take to the states at

That institute has received support to the tune of $35 million from this government that will allow it continue and expand its valuable research in the area of public discussion of mental health and suicide issues as well as early childhood mental health, which is such a central part of our mental health reform package in this budget.

As all members know, and as the member for Newcastle in particular knows, diagnostic imaging is an incredibly important part of the healthcare system and a fast-growing part of healthcare expenditure. In 2009-10, Medicare expenditure on diagnostic imaging was around $2.15 billion, an increase of over 10 per cent on the previous year in spite of a range of supply-side restrictions in the area of

In response to significant advocacy from the sector and the broader community, in last year's budget this government announced a broad review into diagnostic imaging, which has led to the announcement of a $104.4 million diagnostic imaging reform package over the next four years. In particular, that package will do a couple of things. Firstly, it will expand the number of Medicare licensed MRI machines around the country from about 125 to about 200, an increase of over 50 per cent. That particularly will benefit regional communities. Also, we have responded to advocacy from the sector that would allow

From November 2012, children aged 16 and under will receive a Medicare benefit for a GP requested, clinically appropriate MRI service for the first time. That Medicare eligibility will be expanded to Australians over the age of 16 from the following year, 1 November 2013. These are reforms that will significantly improve diagnostic imaging and thereby significantly improve the health of all Australians.

At estimates we have been told that the NPAPH now predominantly focuses on obesity, but the listed outcomes of the NPAPH clearly state that it also covers smoking, consumption of alcohol and a healthy start to life. Are these all now going to fall through the crack as the NPAPH is now purely obesity focused?

                                                             I thank the shadow parliamentary secretary for his question and for his interest in preventative health. As I indicated in an earlier response, this government has taken an unprecedented interest and approach to preventative health, reflecting the fact that only some two per cent of the country's total health spending is made on prevention rather than treatment and cure. This is an area in which the country—the government but the health system broadly—simply must do better.
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>
                                                             That is why as part of our analysis of the healthcare system, the foundation of our health reform process, we engaged the National Preventative Health Taskforce to look at ways in which we could significantly improve our approach to preventative health. As the shadow parliamentary secretary knows, that task force was asked particularly to focus on three areas of prevention identified by the government as particular areas of priority: smoking, alcohol and obesity or diet and physical activity. That task force delivered a very comprehensive report about ways in which we could deal with those three health priorities in particular and also a broader approach to prevention from a Commonwealth government point of view.
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>
                                                             At the same time, as the shadow parliamentary secretary has outlined, the government engaged the states and territories very early after its election in an agreement to ramp up our approach in preventative health, leading to the largest ever preventative health agreement with the states and territories, concluded in 2008—I think it is a five-year agreement, but I am happy to take that on notice—and comprising some $872 million in investment from the Commonwealth.
                                                            </p>

                                                             I add that the government has been committed for some time, in keeping with the recommendations of the Preventative Health Taskforce, to establishing an agency which will have cross-portfolio responsibility for prevention. As the shadow parliamentary secretary, as a medical practitioner, knows, good prevention cannot rely simply on the health portfolio and the

                                                             . Good prevention requires a capacity to get into schools through the education portfolio and deal with children at a young age to teach them about good healthy habits. A good example of that has been the Gillard government's Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program, which many members in this place have in their own electorates and will have visited. I have one in the electorate of

It is delivering wonderful advances not only to the understanding of the children who use that program but, through them, to the understanding of their broader families. I was there in only the last couple of weeks, and members of the school council were telling me that parents were reporting to them that their children were giving them lectures about the healthy or unhealthy nature of the meals that they were consuming at night. So this reflects a broad approach.

                                                             The Preventive Health Agency's work, as I indicated before we were interrupted, is to coordinate the Commonwealth's work in the preventative health sphere. One of those jobs obviously will be taking control or oversight of the Commonwealth programs that we have committed to undertaking as part of the COAG National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. I cannot remember all of the points that the shadow parliamentary secretary asked about, but I am happy to take those specific points on notice. Suffice it to say that all of the commitments we have undertaken as part of the NPA will be fully discharged by the Commonwealth and will become part of the Preventive Health Agency's work. It is not right that the Preventive Health Agency will only be dealing with obesity—I cannot remember whether that was part of the question. Its immediate remit will be the three areas identified by the Preventative Health Taskforce. I indicated that they are smoking, obesity—particularly childhood obesity—and alcohol abuse. But in due course the Preventive Health Agency will take a broader view of preventative health work.

We agreed to keep that commitment, which we did, and we added an extra $15 million plus. I got another $7 million, I think it was, which meant that the cancer care centre could come on line one year sooner than it would have otherwise. That meant that people did not have to travel as far to have their radiotherapy treatment, which is really significant for better health outcomes and for some of those terrible statistics that show that people in regional, rural and remote areas sometimes die more quickly than those in metropolitan areas, where people can access facilities. It is a rather stark thing to say, but that is a health statistic that we have.
                                                                   </p>

We were fortunate to get $2.6 million and then got some extra money in the budget this year, because when they went to do the redevelopment they found asbestos and termites and it required nearly $1 million to flesh that out. But there have been more than that in terms of my area. We also had provision in the integrated cancer care centre for the second linac, the linear accelerator. We were able to get some money out of the regional money available for the second linac and they are just commissioning that at the moment. It takes quite a few months to set that up, but we went and had a look at it the other day. There is also a PET-CT scanner and an additional

That is really useful in assessment and triage of patients when they first come into the hospital. At Grafton Base Hospital as well for the first time in years money was made available to bring it up to a modern facility. I recently went to the commissioning of the new emergency department and it is just wonderful to see. It is an old hospital and it was one of those that no-one in the health department really wanted to touch for a long time but we got the $18 million there, which is not a lot of money in terms of a hospital, and it was really good value for money.

She has been a strong advocate not only for health reform generally but particularly for the needs of regional Australia, and for mental health, along with a number of other regional members of parliament on this side of the main committee, including the member for Capricornia, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, who have tirelessly advocated for the needs of regional communities. We do know, as the member for Page outlined, that Australians living in rural and regional and particularly remote Australia experience greater difficulty than metropolitan Australians in getting access to quality health care. That has been a particular focus of this government over the last 3½ years.
                                                                       </p>

She also alluded to the broad $560 million program to deliver regional integrated cancer centres in rural and regional Australia which help to close that gap in cancer care that the member for Page outlined.
                                                                       </p>

Because of the quality of the bandwidth and the quality of the equipment being used in those facilities, it will allow remote diagnosis for the first time from Adelaide by resident psychiatrists at Glenside Hospital, the major psychiatric hospital in Adelaide, as well as some other places in Adelaide. This stops regional South Australians in that case having to be transported to Adelaide just for the purpose of diagnosis and will significantly reduce the level of trauma involved in that particular area of health care and improve the level of care provided not only to the people themselves but also the support provided to their families. Utterly central to our approach to improving health for regional Australia is the Health and Hospitals Fund. The member for Page has outlined a range of ways in which this government has supported capital improvements in the health system in regional Australia and, as everyone in the Main Committee knows, the latest round of the Health and Hospitals Fund has been focused particularly on regional Australia because we know that regional Australia needs particular attention to ensure it has equal access to the quality health care enjoyed by those living in the capital cities.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        There was very significant interest in this latest round, funded by the budget in May. There were 237 applications made to the Health and Hospitals Fund Advisory Board, 114 of which were identified by the advisory board as satisfying the evaluation criteria and funding, to the tune of about $1.3 million, has been allocated for those 63 regional projects. Another half-a-billion-dollar round will be opened later this year, again, with a priority focus on regional Australia, which will allow a number of those projects that were assessed as appropriate being considered by the Health and Hospitals Fund Advisory Board in that later round.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        The 63 projects include a very broad range of initiatives in regional Australia. I know that the shadow minister for health and ageing will be particularly interested in the subacute or integrated care centres funded through this round for mental health care in regional Queensland. There has been a significant gap in Queensland for a considerable period of time in this area. People are cared for either at an acute level in Queensland or at a primary care level. We know the importance of improving subacute care. There have been a range of other projects for regional hospitals: dental care, primary health care, further cancer infrastructure and such like. I thank the member for Page for her ongoing interest in improving health care not only for her constituents but for regional Australia generally.

How many of the EPPICs announced in the 2010 budget are operational and how many have commenced construction? What proportion of funding will be provided by the Commonwealth for each EPPIC? And, finally, why does the minister consider a GP mental health plan is worth less in terms of a Medicare rebate than a GP management plan that assists patients with physical chronic health conditions?

The EPPIC model has existed for almost 20 years and, as members would know, it was initiated by former Australian of the Year Patrick McGorry and has operated in western Melbourne since about 1991 or 1992. It has never previously received Commonwealth government funding and support. In all of the 11 or 12 years of the Howard government, the EPPIC model did not receive Commonwealth government support.
                                                                         </p>

That was a recommendation from the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, chaired by Christine Bennett, and funding was provided in the 2010 budget for up to, I think, four additional EPPICs, based on cost sharing with the states: 60 per cent Commonwealth, 40 per cent states. As the shadow minister would know, that was then the cost-sharing arrangement for acute care included within the

This current budget adopts a different proposal based on the varied arrangement agreed by the states and territories and the Commonwealth in February, which is that there be a fifty-fifty cost-sharing arrangement. The money included in the 2011 budget is for 16 centres to be rolled out across Australia based on a fifty-fifty cost-sharing arrangement with the states. Obviously that is something we have started to talk to states about but we have not yet got agreement. If we get no input from states, the Commonwealth will proceed to roll out eight centres fully funded by the Commonwealth, and the costing arrangements are based on advice that Patrick McGorry's organisation, Origin, has provided to the department since the 2010 budget measures. That work, as well as ongoing discussions with the states about the degree to which they have an in-principle interest, as opposed to a financial commitment, has meant that none of the four

The evaluation showed that the Better Access scheme had improved the level of access to treatment, particularly for people with high prevalence, mild to moderate disorders, and that there had been a reasonably positive outcome for consumers. It also showed that there was a very differential distribution across the community. It cut a number of ways, but the most stark and obvious way was that different quintiles, by socioeconomic status in the community, received very different levels of service. In 2009, for example, the richest quintile of Australians received 2½ times the number of services, attracting three times the amount of Medicare dollars compared with the poorest quintile of Australians. The difference between service numbers and Medicare dollars reflects that those in the highest quintile disproportionately received services from psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. We decided that we needed to take a look at that program to see whether or not there were ways in which we could redirect funding from that program, which is still projected to grow significantly, into more targeted primary care. One of the ways we have done that by reducing

It is an issue that I know affects many of us in this place. When I was 22, I had the experience of giving the eulogy of a friend of mine who had taken his own life. It is one of those experiences that you never forget and that you never want any other young person to have to go through.

I know the minister spoke in answer to the previous question about the EPPIC models for serious mental illness, and in the youth space there is also the headspace model for moderate ill health. I was hoping that the minister would reflect as well on some of the other interventions across the life cycle. We know, for example, that in the area of early childhood intervention there are programs that show promise. There is even a study, for example, which shows that expert observations of toddlers correlate with suicide attempts in adulthood, suggesting that there are hints of mental ill health that appear before the age of 12—the age at which headspace and EPPIC begin. Thinking right through the life cycle, we know that suicide peaks in the age range of 35 to 44. In fact, when I crunched the numbers it looked to me as though the typical Australian suicide victim was aged 44. We know that, for example, if we look at depressive episodes or anxiety disorders often brought on by workplace trauma, those are going to be things that appear later in life, in middle age, well after the age range of eligibility for headspace and

I opened a day-long event in my electorate on 12 October last year which was titled 'Towards recovery: how do we talk about suicide?'

Particularly I wanted the minister to reflect on how the government's policy of looking at mental health right across the life cycle, not just in the 12 to 25 years age range, is producing the best results.

He has made a number of very important contributions to the public and parliamentary debate around mental health, along with many other members from both sides of the parliament. I particularly remember a speech that he gave reflecting on the experiences he has repeated again today in the chamber about his friend and about suicide prevention, and also the piece that he wrote for the

I know that he had very good discussions with Professor Patrick McGorry about youth mental health. It was a very thoughtful piece, penned at a very critical time in the debate within the sector about what our focus as a government should be on mental health reform.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            This budget does deliver on the Prime Minister's commitment made last year that mental health reform would be a priority of this term of government. As the member for Fraser has outlined, there is a package comprising $2.2 billion of new measures, part of which was announced over the course of the last year and $1.5 billion of which was announced on budget night. The measures announced last year very importantly focus on suicide prevention. Some years ago, only in the middle part of the last decade, suicide prevention from the Commonwealth's point of view attracted probably less than $10 million in a year. After the rollout of the measures announced last year as well as the step up that has taken place since the middle part of the last decade, started by the Howard government and continued by our government, that will be more like $50 million a year—a quintupling of the focus by the Commonwealth on suicide prevention—because all members in this place have experienced either directly amongst their family and friends or among their constituency the tragedy of suicide, which we know is still the largest killer of males under 45 and the largest killer of females under 35.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            The member for Fraser makes an important point too, which is that our package does not simply focus on one age group or one part of the community. It focuses on the whole of the life span. It tries to take an approach that is not only health based but recognises that good mental health depends as much on good employment, good housing, good education and training, and good social support as it does on good clinical care through the health system. That is something I think we all understand. Finally, it also rests on the foundational idea that you do not have to choose between health reform and mental health reform, which was at the heart of the Leader of the Opposition's package last year. You can have both and, indeed, you should have both.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            I want to take up a couple of points made by the member for Fraser about nought to 12 or early childhood and primary school aged children, because increasingly we understand in the education and physical health space the importance of the first five years. We know that that is where the brain develops at its fastest rate and, increasingly, as the member for Fraser has indicated, we know that good mental health later in life depends on a good experience in the first five years of your life. We have already followed up that intuition through our Perinatal Depression Plan, launched in the very early stages of the Rudd government, with the support of beyondblue and we have followed that up, again, in this package, with strong supports for promoting good mental health among children.
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            We have decided that the Healthy Kids Check, initiated by this government, will move from four years to three years of age, based on expert advice, particularly from paediatricians, child psychiatrists and the like, that the earliest possible check gives the best opportunity to identify emerging behavioural and other disorders and to identify whether the child is developing well in terms of their emotional and social wellbeing. In the next twelve months we will expand that Healthy Kids Check to incorporate social and emotional wellbeing elements. That was a very strong recommendation from experts in this field. It is also supplemented by a focus on the middle years and the primary school years, again, based on strong advice from the Research Alliance for Children and Youth, ARACY, an organisation that I think all members of parliament are familiar with.
                                                                           </p>

Given that the minister has released the numbers of services at Palmerston and at Strathpine in February this year, why can the department not release this information? Given that this information relates to only self-reported figures, why is it considered commercial-in-confidence? Why are the department only taking self-reported figures from the GP superclinics? Are the department checking or confirming the self-reported figures presented to them? Why are the department not undertaking more detailed analysis of the use or presentations at each GP superclinic, considering the size of the taxpayer contribution to this initiative? Given that the Townsville GP Superclinic, an existing practice, is described as 'offering early services,' what is the definition of 'early services' under the GP Super Clinics Program? Given that the minister promised, on 6 November 2007, a GP superclinic in Wanneroo, does the minister believe it is acceptable that this clinic will not be opened until late 2012? Can the minister advise what date the clinic will open and see a patient? Will it be in Wanneroo? And can the minister guarantee that no existing practice will be closed or folded into the superclinic?

We need to ensure that those communities who have high healthcare needs that are not well-served by a market based solution, which is generally the approach taken in the Medicare system, get the sorts of supports that are delivered through the GP Super Clinics Program.
                                                                              </p>

As the shadow parliamentary secretary indicated, there are 11 GP superclinics that are operational, but there are also nine services that are providing early services and are under construction. There is an additional service providing early services without construction, and there are 10 further services that are under construction and in a short time will be providing services, no doubt. I am happy to take the particular questions the shadow parliamentary secretary has asked on notice, and I thank him for his interest in the delivery of good-quality primary health care to the Australian community.

I suggest that the order for the consideration of the proposed expenditures agreed to by the House previously be varied by considering the proposed expenditure for the following portfolios after the Attorney General's portfolio this afternoon: firstly, the Foreign Affairs segment of the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio; secondly, the workplace relations and

On budget day I released this year's immigration program. It is appropriate that I talk a little bit about that because the most important part, in many senses, of an immigration minister's role is to set the immigration program for each year. We have taken the decision to increase the immigration program this year to 185,000 places, with 16,000 places specifically for regional Australia. Over two-thirds of the program will be for skilled migrants to help fill critical skill needs. It is well known that the Australian economy has emerged very strongly from the global financial crisis, and as the mining boom mark 2 is driving record investment across Australia it will present unprecedented opportunities for Australia. But it is important that we indicate that we want our migration program to deal with not only the emerging pressures but the existing and re-emerging pressures for workforce capacity. This is not just a matter for the resources sector, although the resources sector feels it particularly acutely, but a matter across the economy. I know that I regularly have representations from the hospitality field, for example, and from the retail sector generally, about skills gaps and about labour shortages. So the increases in the immigration program that I announced on budget day are very important. They are prudent, they are responsible and they are necessary. It has been particularly important to make sure that they are focused on the areas of greatest need. Those areas are regional Australia, whether in

There has been a particular need to fill labour shortages and skills gaps in regional Australia. The allocation of 16,000 places as an indication, subject to demand, for regional Australia is very important.
                                                                                  </p>

Regional migration agreements are a first; they are an important opportunity for local councils, regional development organisations, chambers of commerce and unions to come together to assess the labour needs in their particular region and to make it easier for businesses in that region to develop further agreements and bring in temporary workers under those agreements. Also important are the enterprise migration agreements, which are very much focused at megaprojects. The thresholds that we have set in terms of enterprise migration agreements mean that a relatively small, but nevertheless significant, number of projects across the country—perhaps 14 or so—will qualify for treatment as a megaproject in the resources sector, which will make it significantly easier for those projects to attract the type of temporary migrants that they need. There will be close consultation with all the relevant affected parties, including trade unions—that is something that is appropriate—to make sure that we set the appropriate standards. In particular, we will set standards in relation to the needs for domestic training. It will be a very clear requirement of having an enterprise migration agreement that there be an opportunity for domestic training in the areas of labour shortage for which migrants are being sought. It will not be appropriate to have a general program, but people will need to show us how they are engaging in domestic training, making it possible for us to justify entering into an enterprise migration agreement.

I am very pleased with the processing regime for 457 visas. There has been a considerable improvement under this government in the amount of time it takes to process 457 visas, but we can always do better. The new $10 million centre in Brisbane will make substantial progress.

I am more than happy to compare our record with theirs when it comes to 457 visa processing. The figures speak for themselves: it is considerably quicker to get a 457 visa under this government than it was under the previous government. I am more than happy, if the honourable member for Cook chooses to ask me a question about that, to answer it. That is my opening statement, and I look forward to fielding questions from honourable members.

The coalition significantly increased skilled migration when we were in government, so any increase in skilled migration is also always welcome. But where I want to focus today is on a matter that the minister has not focused on in his opening statement. I would have thought he might have, because he is, I am sure, spending quite a bit of time trying to land a deal in Malaysia which, almost seven weeks later, has not yet been completed. My questions relate to that arrangement, and specifically to the funds that have been set aside in the budget. I refer to page 17 of the portfolio additional statements regarding administered expenses, and the item 'Regional Cooperation Framework—Transfer of Irregular Maritime Arrivals to Malaysia', which provides for $65.7 million to be spent over four years in output class 4.3. Can the minister provide a breakdown of the amounts to be paid to the

Has the minister provided in that funding envelope any package for training of those approximately half a million individuals to ensure that they do not abuse the human rights and liberties of any of the 800 people transferred to Malaysia?
                                                                                   </p>

Will the $65.7 million spent by the agencies receiving these funds be paid directly to service providers in areas such as health, education, accommodation and meals on a consumption basis or is it a fixed payment to the provider of those services with no reference to whether those services are actually used? How much of the $65.7 million will be spent by the agencies receiving these payments on administration?

How will this government be reporting on the disbursement of those funds to this parliament? In particular, will they be subject to scrutiny by the Auditor-General? If so, when?
                                                                                   </p>

Who gets the money? What is it for? How will it be spent? How will it be audited? Will it support those 800 who are sent there on an ongoing basis or will it just be one lump, up-front payment and after that they will be on their own? These are the questions that I think it is necessary to answer. They involve the specifics of this arrangement so Australians can understand what exactly it is that the government is proposing with this arrangement. I look forward to the minister's answers.

It is the first time he has indicated that. It has been a little over a month since the budget and it is the first time the shadow minister for immigration has talked about the immigration program. We see lots of press releases on his website but nothing about the immigration program. Call me old-fashioned, but I tend to think that the shadow minister for immigration should have a position on the immigration program and I welcome the fact that we now have one. That is a very good thing. I know he finds it difficult to complete a sentence without the word 'boat' in it, but I think he managed to get through an entire set of questions without mentioning that word, which is a major achievement for the member for Cook. I welcome that and I welcome the fact that he actually talked about skilled migration.

The government has announced a commitment to enter into a bilateral arrangement at the prime ministerial level. There have, of course, been intensive discussions prior to that announcement and after that announcement about the implementation of the various matters which the honourable member refers to.

Settling almost 1,000 African refugees in an electorate like Newcastle has been a challenging task and one that has been well embraced by the community—but it has not been without problems. The minister is aware that earlier this year, after the Social Justice Council of the Catholic diocese of Maitland-Newcastle approached me and brought to my attention some serious matters regarding the delivery of those contracts, I asked the department to investigate those concerns through the minister. However, it was not until I actually sat with the Rwandan and Congolese families who were newly arrived in my electorate—I sat with them for 2½ hours; it was a devastating 2½ hours—that I heard of their distress, saw their depression, saw their destroyed morale, saw their damaged confidence and saw that their belief in the strength and greatness of this country was at risk. I brought the matter to the attention of the minister, who took very strong, direct and immediate action. It has been recorded in the parliament that the minister instigated an independent inquiry conducted by

She raises a very important matter, which I would have thought would be important to members on both sides of the House. I place on record, as I have previously, my thanks to the member for Newcastle for the way that she has handled these matters. She rang me, as I recall, in early April to raise with me directly her concerns about settlement services in Newcastle. I asked her to put her concerns in writing, which she did the next day. I received those the next day. Within a week we had instigated an independent review for which

We have let people down. We have settled refugees in Australia but have not supplied them with the support that they need. That is a cause of great regret for the government, for me and, I know, for the member for Newcastle. It is important that we recognise and acknowledge that, and take steps to make sure it does not happen again.
                                                                                      </p>

They occurred under a contract which was entered into in 2005 and which was replaced early this year. The contract management provisions and the terms of the contract have been significantly improved since then, which I am pleased about, but I am not yet satisfied that all action has been taken to ensure that what happened in Newcastle is not repeated across the board. I am satisfied that it is occurring, but there is more work to do.

The inspections found that most clients in long-term accommodation were well settled and living in well-maintained properties. We have moved people out of inappropriate properties. There have been some instances where we offered to move people, but the families, because they have been to some degree settled, have requested to stay there and, in those instances, we have taken measures to ensure that those properties are safe and improved as much as they can be while they are being occupied.

That company no longer provides services in Newcastle, although it does provide services elsewhere in Australia under contract, so it is important that that forensic audit take place. I am advised that that process has begun. In addition, I put on record that we will reserve the right to take further action depending on the results of that forensic audit.

We have also instigated an audit of all property across the country that we resettle refugees in, and that will take some time. It is a large task but it is a necessary task, because I do not want to receive another call from another member on either side of the House bringing to my attention matters such as the member for Newcastle brought to my attention. I want to make sure that we know about it straightaway and that we are dealing with it in an appropriate manner, and I am confident that that will be the case. It is important that when we settle refugees we settle them well. Australia has a well-regarded refugee settlement program. The

I ask the minister, if he does not know the answers to these questions, if he would be able to take them on notice, including those that I asked when I last got to my feet. I seek the commitment from the minister in his response that he will take each of these on notice if he is unable to answer them today.

Is the payment based on a per capita figure for each of the 800 transferred, and, if so, what is that figure? That would seem to be a fairly basic item to determine what the average total cost will be as it has been placed in the arrangement. He should know whether it includes training for those who enforce immigration law in Malaysia. He avoided that completely. He is unable to provide a breakdown of how this money will be spent on meals and accommodation and over what period of time. So how he comes up with this figure I do not know, and I think it is important that parliament should be told what is in this figure and how it has been arrived at. He is unable to tell us, for example, whether, for those agencies that receive funds, they are paying it out on a fee-for-service basis or as an upfront payment.

Clearly these matters must be under discussion, and clearly they must have been thought of before the minister put this money in the budget. So I ask the minister if he is able to shed some light on those matters today. I would welcome that, but, if he is unable to do that, I am disappointed, I am surprised and I hope that he will attend to getting those responses to us as quickly as possible. I will add a few more to the list. On page 18 of the portfolio additional statements, it states that around $10 million has been allocated for departmental expenses in relation to the Malaysian agreement. Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of staff costs; staff numbers involved on a full-time equivalent basis; accommodation costs that are included in that budget; costs for travel, training and contractors; and any other relevant line items that go to the composition of that figure over the forward estimates?

In the budget, $130 million was allocated for a phantom regional processing centre, because at estimates the department was unable to say where this was or what it was. It was a phantom processing centre. Can the minister advise whether he now knows where that centre that the government have budgeted $130 million for will be? Does he agree with the foreign minister that current discussions with Papua

It may not be that we transfer 800 people to Malaysia; it may be that fewer than that arrive, in which case we would not transfer 800 people to Malaysia.

We will be cooperating with the Malaysian government to ensure appropriate facilities are in place.

The honourable member opposite talks about Nauru. I would be interested in what his allocation for operational costs for Nauru are. I would be interested to see the honourable member—he will get five minutes—outline what his prudent allocation for the operational cost of Nauru would be. Our prudent allocation for the operational cost of a regional processing centre is in the vicinity of $130 million. He says it would be a fraction of $130 million for a centre which would presumably be for 1,500 people. I know why he can say it will be a fraction of $130 million. It is because under the previous government they hid the cost. They spread the cost right across the government—they hid it in the overseas development aid budget; they hid it in the Defence budget—because they were so ashamed of the operational cost of Nauru.

Skilled migrants who settle in regional Australia will be important in supporting the viability of regional enterprises that operate there. This in turn will create and sustain jobs for Australians in the regions and contribute to social and cultural diversity across the country.

As the honourable member correctly points out, ensuring that we have migrants moving to regions where there is demand is very important, not only economically but also socially. There are many regions around the nation which are crying out for more people to live in them—both migrants from overseas and people moving around Australia. That was the focus of our announcements on budget day in relation to regional migration, particularly skilled migration but also humanitarian migration. It important that we have humanitarian migrants settling in the regions. That goes to the question of the honourable member for Newcastle in ensuring we have adequate support in place.
                                                                                               </p>

We have seen a fourfold increase in the number of skilled migrants settling in regional Australia over the last decade, under governments of both persuasions. That is very good thing because it is good for the regions, it is good for capital cities in terms of dealing with their congestion pressures—concerns which the honourable member, as a fellow

We made an allocation for regional skilled migration of 16,000 places. That will be dependent on demand, but that is an indication of what we feel would be appropriate and what we would be prepared to accommodate should that demand be there. I hope and expect that demand will be there. There are a number of other measures which we have put in place. The regional migration agreements will bring together employers, local and state governments, regional development organisations, chambers of commerce and unions. The definition of a region will change across the country, and I am not intending to be prescriptive about it. It may be that, in some cases, a group of local councils commonly regarded as one region will join together to develop a regional migration agreement; in other cases, it may well be that different boundaries apply. We will be taking a flexible approach to applications from organisations—primarily local government, I would envisage—in the definition of a region. That will enable template agreements and clear and easy processing for small businesses, in particular, and larger businesses in those regions to enable them to attract the necessary workers under 457 and other temporary arrangements.

I am sure the minister will be surprised that I have risen to ask him these questions.

He made his announcement the next day here, in the confines of

                                                                                                </p>

If he cannot answer them here, would he be so kind as to take them on notice, as he did with questions by the member for Cook. My questions include these. What is the total cost of the establishment of the Inverbrackie detention facility, including a breakdown of how much per property the government has spent on upgrading the facility prior to its opening in late December? What is the total recurrent spending over the forward estimates for the facility, including the costs of transport, the use of local health services and educational facilities and payments to the state government? In relation to those issues, could the minister outline to the House whether the state government agreement has been signed yet regarding the children from Inverbrackie attending local schools?
                                                                                                </p>

He made several claims that evening that there would be a significant economic benefit to the local community. I am interested in whether the minister can now verify, in facts and figures, the economic benefit that he talked about that evening, including how many jobs have been created for local people from the Adelaide Hills, the percentage of total spending on the facility and how much of that has gone to local businesses and local contractors. For instance, how much of the building work that went on in Inverbrackie went to local contractors? Other than the grocery service, which locals are providing for the Inverbrackie facility, how many other local contractors and businesses have ongoing contracts for the facility?
                                                                                                </p>

In relation to the total cost of the Inverbrackie facility, it is completely in line with the previous announcement. Yes, there were some remedial works necessary for some of the buildings, as you would expect with buildings which have not been occupied for some time. That was built into the original costing. So the total funding envelope is no different to the total funding envelope which has previously been announced.
                                                                                                 </p>

As he correctly points out, a local business won the grocery contract, which is a substantial one and one that I think has been well received. A substantial number of

Again, I cannot recall the exact number off the top of my head, but it is a substantial number. I will take that on notice and report back to him in relation to the number of Adelaide Hills employees, but we certainly encourage Serco to employ locals wherever possible and Serco does take that approach. That has certainly been the case in relation to the Inverbrackie facility.

That was put in place immediately, as I outlined at a public meeting which he and I attended. That means that Serco and the department have a plan in place for managing what could be a very serious bushfire incident, and that includes evacuation plans et cetera.

But I am not aware of any particular concerns that have been raised by local schools or local principals in relation to those questions. In relation to other questions raised and some of the details about the economic benefit, I am more than happy to report back to the honourable member in the spirit of goodwill which I have always attempted to give the local member, the honourable member for Mayo. As I say about the honourable member for Mayo, he holds an important role as chairman of the waste watch committee. It is a fine institution that has in the past played an important role in keeping governments to account, although it has gone downhill on his watch.

But in particular I would like to commend the minister for pursuing a regional cooperation framework, along with the Prime Minister. As we know, and unlike what the opposition would perhaps have us believe, irregular migration and asylum seekers moving around the region is not just an issue for Australia. It is an issue across the countries in our region, and that is why it is so important that we work with other countries, not just in our own little bubble. We must work together because—and I think the minister has said this many times, as has the Prime Minister—we do not want people getting on boats, risking their lives, to end up with tragedies such as the one on

With their smoke and mirrors, they would like us to think that, but we know that there was not international engagement or engagement with countries in our region. This is a very important step that I commend the minister for.

Earlier this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I attended the Bali ministerial meeting. Officials who have been involved in these meetings for many years, since their instigation, said to me that more progress had been made at that meeting than at all the previous meetings combined in terms of reaching an agreement on a way forward for a regional framework. All 44 nations participating in that conference agreed with a regional framework which outlined that this is a regional issue requiring a regional response and outlined the possibility of bilateral agreements within the regional framework. The Bali communique, for example, indicated the possibility of transfer arrangements, which is one that this government has pursued with Malaysia in consultation with the

Those opposite have claimed that the UNHCR endorses their approach, and that has been a false claim. We have seen the Deputy Leader of the Opposition claim that, we have seen senators claim that and we have seen the UNHCR have to come out and repudiate that, which I think is very unfortunate. I am more than happy for a robust debate around these issues, but it must be based on fact. When one side of the parliament claims that the UNHCR—

Malaysia is a transit country and a destination country. Malaysia is the country in which most people start their boat journey to Australia. Most asylum seekers who come to Australia from the

The whole fundamental underpinning of the Malaysian arrangement is that you do not achieve the outcome, because you return to where you began the boat journey. There is no point undertaking a boat journey, a dangerous boat journey, an expensive boat journey, because you get returned to where you began that boat journey.
                                                                                                     </p>

That is why I think organisations like the UNHCR have seen some benefit in this, not only the increase in humanitarian intake, which is very important for the government and very important for me personally that Australia should play more of a role in resettling genuine refugees across the region. I am very proud of the fact that under this arrangement, our humanitarian intake returns to its highest level since Labor was last in office in 1996—higher than at any point under the previous government. That is a very good thing and something that we should be proud of.

Five to one is a very good outcome because it means that Australia is resettling more people who have been waiting a very long time in difficult circumstances and who do not have the money or the inclination to get on a boat. They should not be forgotten in this debate. These are the forgotten people of this debate, and the opposition can claim that taking five to one is too many. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that the fundamental problem with this agreement is that Australia was taking too many refugees. I have a fundamental problem with the Leader of the Opposition's approach because I am very proud of the fact we are taking more genuine refugees. I think that is a very good thing. I think it is a good thing that we are working with a country like Malaysia to improve protection outcomes at the same time as providing a very significant disincentive to get on a boat and it could only be possible through genuine regional engagement, engagement through the Bali process, engagement with the

The contract with Navitas was entered into in the year 2005. When was the new Navitas contract awarded? What processes were in place to check the services being provided by Navitas to the new entrants? What postevaluation follow-ups occurred prior to the new Navitas contracts being awarded to provide settlement services? What was the total value of the contract with Navitas? What services were they contracted to provide? What were the agreed milestones in the settlement services funding agreement—did they achieve these prior to the new contracts being awarded? And what reports did Navitas provide the department during the life of their previous contract? The

How many employees of Navitas have been investigated by the police for fraud after the allegations of money scamming from Congolese people were reported earlier this year? Has the department received complaints from members of the community in relation to the settlement services provided in the Newcastle-Hunter area? How many complaints did the department receive? Will you make public the results of both the departmental review and the other review that you have undertaken, and will those reports be made available to the parliament?

Earlier this year, there were reports of local parishioners being asked to provide rental properties for humanitarian settlement in the community. Can you give us an update on how many community placements have occurred in Western Australia, how that particular program is going? Also, how you expect to accommodate the community humanitarian program, considering there are considerable housing shortages?

That report found that only 40 per cent of humanitarian entrants had a job after five years. Why does the department think that this is so, and what strategies are being considered to improve this number? What employment prospects and employment pathways does the department provide?

In relation to the arrangement with Malaysia, the costs of resettlement were outlined in the announcement. That does include, under the normal arrangements, all the costs that go to resettlement, including support through other government agencies. That has been factored into the costings, and the fact that we are resettling 4,000 people enables a per capita cost to be calculated from that.
                                                                                                       </p>

It is important that that Navitas contract in the Newcastle region is a different one to the previous one and involves a different housing provider. As I understand it, Navitas itself is doing the housing, as opposed to Resolve

I will need to take that on notice to consider whether that is commercial-in-confidence. I will take advice on that. If it is possible to release them then I will, but I will take advice on whether it is prudent, appropriate and legal.
                                                                                                       </p>

That is a matter which may well have some commercial-in-confidence elements to it, but I would have thought that there should be some public commentary on its results. As to whether the full report is released, that is something that I will consider once I have received it and once I have received the appropriate legal advice.
                                                                                                       </p>

I assume she was referring to the Richmond review of contract management. Again, I take the view that I will make public commentary about that and will release what is prudent, appropriate and responsible to do in the interests of transparency.

I have not indicated which company have had employees referred to the New South Wales police. I have indicated that there have been referrals to the New South Wales police. I would caution the House that we need to be careful about making broad and sweeping statements about who has been referred to the New South Wales police. It is a small number, but nevertheless they are obviously very serious incidents. Not all of them have necessarily been recent. Some of them were over a period of years some years ago, but nevertheless they are very serious matters. As I said to the House before, I am not in a position to update the House on the results of that police investigation.

Since the announcement made last October by the Prime Minister and me that we would move the majority of children and families into the community by the end of this month, I have approved community detention placements for 1,309 people. This includes 631 adults and 678 children, of whom 432 are accompanied minors and 246 are unaccompanied minors. Of the 1,309 people approved for community detention, of course, some have subsequently been approved for a permanent visa, so they now no longer count in terms of the total for which a majority should be in the community. Of those, there are 249 people who have been granted a permanent visa, including 100 adults and 149 children. There are 707 people currently residing in the community and there are 352 people being moved into the community in coming days, after my approval of their being moved into the community. This has been quite an undertaking, but I am very pleased and proud of the fact that we will meet our commitment to move the majority of children into the community by the end of this month.

Minister, how will cutting funding for Tourism Australia help tourism operators facing a high Australian dollar, less flexible wages and a crippling carbon tax? Will the minister explain why he supports the government spending double the annual budget of Tourism Australia on providing pensioners with overpriced set-top boxes? Minister, do you consider the government's overpriced set-top box giveaway to be more important than bringing tourists to Australia? I refer the minister to the government's decision to cut funding for the Tourist Accommodation Survey. Will the minister explain how cutting the funding for tourism research will help hotel operators place their investment decisions?
                                                                                                             </p>

Minister, therefore, if there are no corporate cost savings in Tourism Australia, what marketing programs will Tourism Australia cut to meet its $6.2 million efficiency dividend? I refer the minister to his press release of 30 April 2010, where he detailed seven measures he was committed to implementing by 30 October this year. Minister, given that your department told the most recent Senate estimates that not a single one of your seven priority measures had been successfully implemented yet, how are you going to implement them with just 77 days to go? I should remind the minister that in the next 77 days, in order to meet the commitments he outlined in his press release, he needs to have chefs included in the skilled occupation migration list, implement national uniformity through responsible service of alcohol, seek the inclusion of tourism in the Commonwealth Enterprise Connect program, undertake destination management pilot projects—plural—to identify the gaps in research and dissemination, restructure the National Tourism and Aviation Advisory Committee, release the study of economic impacts of the carbon tax on tourism, and enhance Indigenous employment by scoping out opportunities for inclusion of tourism in existing government programs. I should note that, on the last point, the minister's department told Senate estimates: 'We are pretty light on in that area at the moment.' Does the minister agree with his department's assessment? Minister, it is going to be a very busy 77 days for you—or will you break your word again?
                                                                                                             </p>

Will the minister confirm that after the election the government decided to deliver just half of these commitments in the current parliamentary term? I refer the minister to the government's decision to increase the passenger movement charge by 24 per cent, and note that the revenue from the passenger movement charge for the first time will exceed $800 million per annum, an increase from just over $400 million per annum when you were first elected to government. I note that the minister said when he was the shadow minister that the passenger movement charge was 'ripping off the travelling public', and then in his first budget as minister he wacked it up by 24 per cent. What kind of rip-off is that, Minister?
                                                                                                             </p>

Will the minister confirm that the government's decision will mean an additional 26-minute wait in the queue for Customs service for our international tourists when they arrive? Minister, what sort of welcome mat do you consider this to be for those coming to Australia?

Why are you allocated only 30 minutes in total for these two very large portfolios? Minister, if you cannot answer these questions here today, I ask you to respond in writing.

In terms of the minerals resource rent tax, there have been different models floated—for example, the idea of putting forward this sovereign wealth fund as a way of locking up the wealth that is generated through the mining boom, as opposed to what we are planning to do through the

This will provide an even greater pool of investment funds for business to tap into and a long-term basis for wealth generation through higher returns. This will ensure that people who retire in the years to come, and the generations that follow us, will be able to have a sustainable income in the years to come. Small businesses will be able to tap into asset write-offs through what we are flagging. I note in particular that a small business owner in my electorate told me the breakdown of his refrigeration equipment would impact on him severely and he would have to take a dent in his cash-flow to replace it. These are some of the things we can fund through the MRRT that we would not be able to do through a sovereign wealth fund. This model will provide something sustainable for the future of this country, and I see that we are now close to being able to bring it to fruition. But, even at this late stage, there are people speculating in the media about the design of the MRRT. Minister, even in the last 24 hours people have been making comment on the design of the tax. I am wondering whether you are able to update us on some of the comments and opinions that have been advanced on what I think will fundamentally be a key economic reform for this country.

Obviously time is not of a long duration because we adopted the same approach to the House of Representatives committee stage processes for the budget as was the longstanding practice of the previous Howard government over almost 13 years. So if the shadow minister has some complaints he ought to take them up with the former Prime Minister of Australia,

Let us be very frank, the Australian economy is going through a process of change at the moment because of the pressure of the mining and petroleum sector and the strength of the Australian dollar. This is reflected in the challenges I confront as Minister for Tourism, and it is also reflected in, for example, the challenges facing the manufacturing industry, for which Senator Kim Carr has responsibility.

The tourism industry is, to some extent, holding its own in very difficult times. Earlier today the member for Paterson asked me for a briefing—and I am surprised he has asked for that so late after the budget—on the activities of the department, budget initiatives and

I have already spoken to my staff today about arranging that briefing, and we will seek to meet his convenience. Perhaps prior to this process next year he might seek a similar meeting. If he had done that this year, we would not have had the waste of time of his long-winded intervention of no substance earlier today.
                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                      I will now go to the latest tourism forecast, released on 26 May, which should answer some of the issues on tourism. I note that, despite oil prices, natural disasters and the high Australian dollar, Australian tourism is actually demonstrating resilience, which is very important to the member for Groom's home state of Queensland given the recent natural disasters, including the impact in his own electorate. Tourism consumption, interestingly, is forecast to increase by 0.4 per cent to $98.4 billion, with inbound visitation forecast to increase 3.1 per cent to 6.1 million in 2011. The committee also forecast that the modest growth in domestic tourism shown in 2010 will continue through 2011. I really hope for the sake of this industry that it actually does occur, because this industry employs, directly and indirectly, just under one million Australians. Domestic nights—and this is a factual report—are forecast to fall by 0.3 per cent to 259 million nights in 2011. Spending, importantly, is forecast to decline by 0.7 per cent due to the impacts of floods, cyclones, the high Australian dollar and, because of the nature of the times, the somewhat close-fisted consumers. Domestic trips, however, remain resilient and are forecast to increase by 0.5 per cent in 2011. Consistent with other growing economies, including China and India—and I appreciate the positive feedback from the member for Paterson about the positive outcomes in Cairns last week in terms of the first ever Australia-China Tourism Summit—China is our real growth opportunity, with currently 470,000 tourists, at a value of about $3.6 billion, expected to double by 2020 and, from a tourism perspective, earnings for Australia, just out of China, of about $6 billion to $7 billion. These economies are very important to us.

It is resilient and it is doing its best to actually survive in these difficult times.
                                                                                                                     </p>

Perhaps he ought undertake a tutorial with the member for Paterson as to what these processes are really about rather than make inane interventions of no consequence or which do not contribution in the long term to the operation and quality of this parliament.

I will give you a few examples why. I actually took phone calls during the global financial crisis from a range of mining companies in Australia, including from a range of coalmining companies, which, because of the impact of the global financial crisis decided, for whatever reason, to actually close coalmines in Australia.

As I was indicating, if he were sitting where I am sitting at the moment, he could not give the Australian community an undertaking that all existing mines will remain in operation, with or without a carbon tax. I can say to the Australian community that I am confident that the coalmining industry in Australia has expanded and will continue to expand and that we will create a wealth of job opportunities as a result of that expansion over the foreseeable future. Let us deal with a few hard facts in terms of mining industry employment in Australia at the moment. Mining investment has skyrocketed, including the coal industry, from $35 billion last year to $51 billion this year, to an expected $83 billion in 2011-12.

I acknowledge that, in terms of the future of the coalmining industry, which goes to the heart of the question posed by the member for Groom, exploration expenditure for coal is estimated to increase by 12 per cent, to around $360 million in 2010-11.

I would like to put it all on the record. In the six months to April 2011—I am waiting for the question on this in question time—we have seen three major coal projects completed, with a combined total capital expenditure of $1.5 billion. Jobs, jobs, jobs—that's what I like! And I know that is what the member for Groom likes. There is a range of other potential investments in this very important sector of the Australian economy, though its production has been seriously hindered over the last six months because of the serious floods and the cyclone in Queensland. But it will fast recover from those events.

I might also say that he made some very glowing statements along similar lines as to the future of the electricity industry in Australia.

His direct action plan is directly focused on reducing employment opportunities in coalmining in Australia. He should not forget that. It is a plan specifically targeted at taking away coalmining jobs in Victoria, in an area that needs assistance in terms of the transition that has to occur.

But, more seriously, in terms of who pays what taxation: I simply say that the mining industry wanted a profits based tax. Yes, it has been complicated—trying to get to this point where we can land this outcome. Industry will only pay taxation at a federal level in terms of when they are receiving super profits.

It is appropriate that this is put on the record—despite what I thought was a xenophobic attack on key investors from overseas during the course of his visit to Canberra yesterday. I remind the House that we are a nation built on the back of foreign investment. And if foreign investment, in the form of Hunan, to the value of about 17 per cent, in Fortescue Metals is appropriate, then it is also appropriate that it occurs with respect to other mining and petroleum companies in Australia. I only wish I could attract some similar investment in new hotels and accommodation opportunities in the tourism sector at the moment. I will never shy away from defending the right of Australia to chase foreign investment, and I think the opposition should also stand up to Mr Forrest over his xenophobic attack on non-Australian-based companies yesterday, because where would we be as to the strength of our economy without foreign investment? I await the member for Groom's intervention—his response—which I think should be dignified, in the same way as I made a dignified response to Mr Forrest yesterday.

The government will not breach its commitment on the heads of agreement or the PTG report on key design features of the tax. Fortescue and all companies are able to have input into the legislative consultation process and the details of those reforms. The starting base is an issue we raise. It is an important feature of the MRRT to recognise the market value of past investments irrespective of which company made those investments. All companies with assets in place as at 10 May are eligible for a starting base to recognise past investment. There is no exception in terms of the particular application to

No deduction is provided for interest expense against MRRT liability because that would undermine the purpose of a rent tax on the value of the resource. Further, the uplift rate is provided on losses effectively market to debt cost deductible. Providing a deduction of interest would engage companies using debt-to-finance projects. Deduction of interest is allowed under company taxation.

I remind the minister that during my time in his portfolio I was one of the greatest exponents of foreign investment in Australia and in fact spent a great deal of time travelling explaining to particularly our friends to the north how welcome they were in Australia. I continue to do that, can I say.

I acknowledge that he has appropriately indicated to Mr Forrest that he totally disagrees with his intervention yesterday in terms of foreign investment. I challenge him to actually make a request to the Leader of the Opposition to make the same position very publicly clear, because I think it is very important to the future of Australia from an investment point of view. On both sides of politics we need to very clearly say that foreign investment is welcome in Australia, unlike the view of Mr Forrest.

Up until budget difficulties on the other side of the House in the lead-up to last election I might say that the member for Groom was a very strong supporter of carbon capture and storage technology opportunities. Last Saturday in Perth, in partnership with the West Australian Minister for Minerals and Petroleum, I announced the first commitment in terms of the Collie hub. We put $53 million on the table to take that project forward. It is aimed at trying to assess appropriate storage capacity for the purpose of storing industrial

To be fair, when you look back over the history of adopting this program one would not have thought that the Collie hub would have come through as the first investment from a Commonwealth perspective. Beyond the Collie hub and if that actually succeeds we will potentially make a contribution to the tune of about $330 million. We are in ongoing discussions with the Queensland and Victorian governments. I also note, and this is reflected in the budget papers, that we have made an amount of money available nationally to work in partnership with state and territory governments and the private sector to assess storage capacity around Australia, because the key to carbon capture and storage is proper assessment of storage capacity. That is pretty important. My own assessment is that there is good potential storage capacity in Queensland, and Victoria is obviously well placed because of its proximity to

I hope that we succeed, because we are a nation that very much depends on fossil fuels. Clearly, there are difficulties with legacy power stations in Victoria. Both sides of politics appreciate the difficulties involved with power stations such as Hazelwood, which is a very high emitter. Whilst there are different approaches to making that transition, one way or another we have to front up to it.

But it is about reliable baseload power. I hope the breakthrough comes sooner rather than later, because, while Australia has been historically energy secure because of its energy resources, the complication now is that we have to put technology in place which reduces CO2 emissions. We should not forget that we will have the biggest commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage on the

Carbon capture and storage is not an unproven technology. The real issue is how you reduce the cost of commercial deployment. I remain committed to trying to test this technology in the same way that I remain committed to pursuing a breakthrough on solar thermal, geothermal or whatever, as I am expected to be. We as a nation have to invest in R&amp;D, because we have a responsibility in terms of our domestic emissions and our future export opportunities. We are getting wealth out of our energy sector; hence we have to invest in R&amp;D and pursue the clean energy strategy.

We have a difference between the major players with respect to how you determine a price on carbon. We both support a renewable energy target of 20 per cent. Under it all, both sides support the need to invest in clean energy technology. There is somewhat of a difference at the moment on carbon capture and storage, but we should not give up on it as a nation, nor should the global community. As the

I therefore would like to ask the Attorney why the government has not referred this case for investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act; and would he like to comment about whether he believes it is appropriate for a man who has admitted support of a terrorist organisation, in this case Lashkar-e-Taiba, and admitted committing offences in relation to his involvement with that organisation—an organisation, I might add, that has literally killed hundreds of people, including two Australians—to make money out of his crimes?

For instance, in the year 2009-10—that is the financial year 2009 and 2010—there were about $18 million of funds that were restrained since the establishment of the task force, which commenced in January of this year. There has already been over $40 million in assets restrained. That task force is not as yet fully up and running. In particular, we will be taking steps to ensure that the task force has its own legal representation, which will significantly give it that additional firepower. We are very optimistic that the proceeds that will be restrained through the task force will be very significant, and that is a very, very significant impediment to crime, because, as you know, crime is undertaken by weighing the risk against the gain. If we attack the gain, we take away a significant incentive for crime to occur.

But, Attorney, there is one thing that does cause me some concern. That is in relation to managing the possible risk of chemicals that could be used by terrorists in respect to manufacturing security issues within this country. I know that a lot has escaped from science fiction theatres in terms of binary fluids and all the rest of it, but what we do know now is that the extent to which terrorists use chemicals for the manufacture of explosives and toxic weapons is beyond doubt. Could you explain what the government is doing to manage the risk posed by terrorists using chemicals of security concern.

In 2008 the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments around Australia reached an agreement to properly assess, monitor and control chemicals of security concern. There is no doubt that chemicals continue to be sought by terrorists to conduct attacks with the potential to cause significant harm to Australians and Australian interests. There have been a number of attacks over the past few years and in the recent budget the government allocated $10 million over four years to continue the important work of managing that risk.

So these are very, very serious.

Governments will continue to consult widely to decide how best to treat identified risks from chemicals of security concerns. That 2008 agreement I referred to was to establish a chemical security management framework which outlines the agreed approach by all levels of government.

Security risk assessments have been finalised for hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, sodium chlorate, potassium chlorate, sodium perchlorate, potassium perchlorate, ammonium perchlorate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, nitromethane and sodium azide. The public awareness campaign aims to inform and build vigilance across the target audience to assist jurisdictional police and security agencies in deterring and also detecting the potential use of these chemicals. It is intended to be a low-key but informative campaign with a focus on educating and fostering relationships with industry to assist them in strengthening their security arrangements and communicating broadly with the community.

That list, developed by Australian governments in consultation with industry and informed by data from the Australian intelligence community, represents those chemicals that can be used by terrorists to produce an improvised explosive device or toxic weapon. Publishing this list is aimed at helping industry and the community to be more informed and vigilant. If any person has a security concern about the inappropriate use of chemicals, they should call the National Security Hotline on 1800123400 to report their concern.

This is not a practice that I will be pursuing should the government change and I get the opportunity to serve in that capacity.

Presumably, it will be once the planes have landed in Malaysia. If there is a stand-off on a plane and asylum seekers refuse to disembark, whose responsibility will it be to end that stand-off? Will it be the responsibility of the Australian Federal Police—if they are the ones accompanying the asylum seekers—or will it be the Malaysian authorities because this will be occurring on their soil? And I want to know what guarantees the Malaysians authorities will give that they will treat detainees in a humane manner in these circumstances. I think that just about covers it. Essentially, I want to know at what stage the Malaysians will take over and what guarantees we have about their behaviour in these circumstances.

We do not want to see that happen again, and that is why we are dedicated to ensuring that we realise and finalise this agreement. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is leading the government's negotiations to resolve that with Minister Hishammuddin from Malaysia.

It would not be the first time we would be facilitating the passage of people offshore, so there is some precedent and convention that our law enforcement and other agencies can consider when they determine the way in which the operational dimension of this agreement will be handled.

We work hand in hand with that country to fight transnational crime, as we do with other countries in the region. With respect to this agreement, we will make sure that there is clear demarcation between the roles of both of the law enforcement agencies and the other agencies of each country so that we are prepared for any eventuality. We would not want to see people in any way unduly affected by this transfer of people seeking asylum to Malaysia. We want to do that in a professional way and I have great confidence that the Australian Federal Police and their counterpart in Malaysia will be able to carry this out. I think it is important that these matters are finalised. I can assure the shadow minister that they will be finalised and articulated by the government upon agreement being reached between our two countries, and I am very happy to indicate to him that this work is being undertaken. It is not finalised, but the work continues. There is engagement between our agencies here and those in Malaysia.

I am confident that the law enforcement and other agencies in Malaysia will have done the same. We want to make sure we do everything we can to prevent any incident occurring that might cause anxiety or concern for those people we will be transferring. I am confident that all of those matters will be determined and a date will be announced when the two countries reach an agreement with all the details enclosed.

Recently I was pleased to join you at the youth centre at Hume City Council in Melbourne, Victoria, to discuss a groundbreaking local project being developed to help mentor young people away from extremist ideologies. The Hume Anti-Violent Extremism Youth project, or the HAVEY project, is one of the inaugural recipients of a community grant under the Australian government's Building Community Resilience Youth Mentoring Grants Program. The Australian government provided the Hume City Council with a $200,000 grant to run the HAVEY project, which will focus on supporting young people through individual and group mentoring. The project will comprise of: mentoring by cultural leaders, youth workers and police youth liaison officers; training sessions on topics such as social connectedness, discrimination, advocacy and developing positive relationships; promotion of cross-cultural understanding between young people from different ethnic groups; and participation in community events and recreational activities.
                                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                                               We know that this program is working extremely well. At the time we were there it was great to have young people there and some of their mentors involved. We were all very keen on what the government was doing and we were shown results from the trial. Could the Attorney-General please explain what other initiatives the government has funded in order to counter violence and extremism as part of the government's all-hazards approach to national security?

Certainly he agrees it was very uplifting to see the program in operation. The Building Community Resilience Youth Mentoring Grants Program is part of the government's $9.7 million investment in the counter-radicalisation initiatives. Of that $9.7 million over four years, about $2.6 million has been allocated for 2011-12. The program funds activities to directly support young people in moving away from intolerant and radical ideologies and encourage positive participation in the community. We received some 98 applications for the program, and that reflects a strong interest in the communities to identify localised solutions to address violence and extremism in youth within their own communities. I am certainly heartened by the result because it signifies the willingness of those communities to be proactive in addressing the serious issue of violent extremism among one of our most vulnerable groups, and that is young people.

Activities suggested through the communities' applications include training for youth to become mentors, leadership training programs, participation through sporting activities and the development and dissemination of counter narratives, as I have mentioned.

Research shows that a range of personal experiences can make young people more vulnerable to extremist messages and to being victimised by those who would seek to exploit them—for example, issues of discrimination, feelings of prejudice and marginalisation, social isolation and worries about employment and educational opportunities. Through the program in the electorate of McEwen, which was the subject of the question, we want to help young people develop skills to deal with these issues in a positive way, while at the same time reducing the appeal of extremism and radical ideologies. We have a rich and vibrant mix of nationalities in Australia. We all benefit from a more inclusive and resilient community. Projects like this demonstrate the way in which the government can work in partnership with local communities to achieve those goals.

If members of our communities cannot feel safe in their own streets, in their own public spaces or in their own homes, of course that corrodes their quality of life. For that reason we do everything we can to ensure that we provide support.

Since December 2007, I can advise the member, over $43 million has been provided—$23 million to support community based crime prevention and drug treatment and diversion programs, and $20 million to government agencies for law enforcement projects. We have a combination of the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Safer Suburbs Plan. They are not huge resources, but the funding has to be based on the merits. I would happily take any submission made by community members from the honourable member's electorate, whether it came from local government or other organisations about the merits of his request. I can assure him that we determine these matters based on the merits of the submissions and the effectiveness of the delivery of the important physical infrastructure that we can install. I should add that it is not just about the installation of physical security infrastructure; it is also about trying to prevent crime. That is why we also dedicate resources to diversionary programs—for example, to stop young people from engaging in antisocial behaviour and to prevent people from falling into improper conduct or perhaps criminal behaviour, which causes problems in the community.

I am happy to consider any submissions he makes. I should add that it is a dedicated and limited resource, but we always take those types of requests seriously and I understand he has an interest in this matters. As I say, I have dealt with other members in Western Australia and other parts of the country around these initiatives. They are very popular. People see that the federal government is working hand in hand with local government and state police. We will continue to do that because we believe we have a role to play in providing resources to other governments in order to prevent crime and, as I said earlier, prevent the fear of crime.

What programs are in place via your portfolio to assist those schools that are most at risk of racial, religious or ethnically motivated vandalism or property crime and harassment? What are we doing to prevent these very unfortunate attacks?

The Secure Schools Program is about dedicating resources to those schools where there is a relatively high level of threat against students or school communities. The purpose of the Secure Schools initiative is to ensure we provide security wherever possible to mitigate such threats. We seek the advice of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to make decisions and we engage very fully with the schools' constituencies in order to talk with them about the best way to mitigate these threats.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

We believe all children in this country have the right to be educated in a safe and secure environment. That is why we have dedicated over the next three years a further $15 million to continue the Secure Schools Program, which I believe illustrates the government's interest in this and concern about providing safety for students, teachers, carers and others who may work within the confines of these schools.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

It is a very important initiative that has been very well received by school communities. I have had the great fortune of visiting a number of schools in four or five states. They have been very appreciative of the government's response to their concerns. We do it in a low-key way. We do not want to attract attention and talk about the particular schools because we think that, paradoxically, that could lead to potential problems for those schools. But I can say it applies to some Jewish schools, some Muslim schools and some government schools that have had some issues. We will continue to dedicate resources based on the relative need, based on the perceived threat as advised by our agencies.

I think those issues are valid, but equally I believe people should not have to be concerned or alarmed about walking the streets, walking in public spaces. I believe that the lighting and CCTV can provide extra assurance. As I say, the fear of crime is a quality-of-life issue. People should not feel that anxious in their neighbourhood. I believe this assists. It is not a panacea, but it certainly does provide assistance for police, for governments and for others to ensure that people feel more secure and indeed are more secure in their communities. I commend the member for Hindmarsh for his advocacy for the initiative and for bringing together all the constituent parts of the community to talk to me about this issue. I would be very happy to return when we are looking to install the physical security infrastructure in his electorate in due course.

It is a bit of a long and winding road, but there is a question at the end, surrounded by 3,000 other questions. Is the Attorney aware that Townsville's population of some 180,000 is growing by between two and four per cent per annum? Would the Attorney agree that, as a city becomes bigger, the need for a stand-alone Family Court increases with that size? Would the Attorney agree that a Townsville based Family Court judge would be the best positioned jurist to service

Is the Attorney aware that the current Family Court judge, Justice Monteith, has been struck with a series of crippling back injuries requiring multiple operations and long periods of convalescence? He has been struck with some incredible injuries and he is still on convalescence. Will the Attorney assure the people of North Queensland that the statistics will not be used in any decision relating to the future of a Townsville based Family Court? Can he reassure North Queenslanders of the importance of the position to the residents in Townsville?

I know that the area is a growing area and that, with growing areas—in particular areas with younger families—there can be a need for family law services. We have contributed a significant amount of funding generally to family law services and in particular to a continuation of the former government's program of family relationship centres. I have visited the centre in Townsville. In the period since we have been in office, the Attorney-General's contribution to family relationship dispute resolution services has increased by some $32.96 million, or 25 per cent, and the contribution of FaHCSIA, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, has increased by $133.5 million, or 179 per cent, amounting to a total of an additional $166.46 million, or an 80 per cent increase, for those family relationship service programs around Australia, including in that region. They have actually resulted in a reduction in filings in the Family Court by about 18 per cent generally.

The court allocates its resources within a budget, but obviously there is a discussion between the government and the court to ensure that services are provided, including services to regional Australia. I understand that the assistance being provided to the region is being welcomed by practitioners. Embarrassingly, the name of the judge escapes me, but I understand that he is doing an outstanding job and being well received by the community up there. Justice Monteith's circumstances are regrettable. Obviously these things, insofar as they cannot be helped, are regrettable, but it does place an additional burden on the court. All I can say to the honourable member is that I note his advocacy on behalf of his constituents. I will revisit that matter about the services to

Attorney-General, a few days ago it was 19 years since the Mabo decision on 3 June 1992, so here we are in our 20th year since that decision. It was an important decision by the High Court, obviously, but more important than the High Court's decision was the response by the Keating government in turning the court decision into a legislative policy that was rolled out and has changed the lives of many Indigenous people around Australia. I go forward a few years to 13 February 2008, my first day at work in

An apology was given by Prime Minister Rudd to the stolen generation, fine words indeed—world-famous words, in fact, that people from all around the world have spoken to me about and that were very significant. But more important than that has been the action since then in engaging with Indigenous people. It is not so much the words but the actions that follow in closing the gap.

Too many of them have been to prison, have had troubles with the law, have had all sorts of challenges. In my travels around as a union organiser I used to regularly go to Woorabinda, to Wadja Wadja High School, a private Aboriginal school, just talking to families and kids. So many of the decisions that would flow later in their lives would come from their sense of safety in their community, from their feeling safe in their bed at night—and sadly, for many folk, it would be actually having a bed or somewhere to sleep that night—or having a house that was a safe place to go to.

The government legislated to give the Federal Court of Australia stronger case management powers, and the judges have actively engaged in this process. For instance, two years before these powers were granted in October last year, I think nine claims were resolved. In the year before, 13 claims were resolved. Since those powers were given to the court in October last year, 37 cases have been finalised and there look like being an additional 43 cases by the end of this year. So the court is making some real inroads by cutting through some of the nonsense that can occur in this area to get the parties to focus on the real issues involved in the cases.

                                                                                                                                                        But the issues of Indigenous justice are very significant and are indeed, I think, some of the crucial issues confronting the government of Australia of whatever political persuasion. The government has invested a considerable amount of resources in closing the gap—that is, in terms of health, education, employment opportunities and the like—but the reality is that, if communities are not safe, they are not going to prosper, and in fact it will be difficult to get those community workers there in the first place.

The statistics are alarming. In 2010, Indigenous adults were 14 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-

Of those in prison, 74 per cent of the Indigenous prison population had a prior imprisonment, compared to 49 per cent of non-Indigenous Australians—in other words, indicating that the period of imprisonment was not effective as a deterrent. And in 2008 Indigenous young people were 29 times more likely to be detained and constituted 50 per cent of the juvenile detention population on any average day, despite constituting a much smaller proportion of the population.

In the budget there were some specific allocations in the area of Indigenous justice, but the reality is that any amount of resources, if not properly targeted, is not going to address those issues and turn around those alarming statistics. That is why the federal government is working with the state governments on program evaluations to assess whether the diversionary and rehabilitation programs can be improved and to assess which are working and which can be considered best practice. The first stage of the evaluations, including a total of 20 programs, is focusing on four areas: Aboriginal courts and conferencing, offender support and reintegration programs, diversion programs and night and community patrols. That evaluation will be completed by the end of the year. The purpose of the evaluation is to build the evidence base about what actually works to reduce offending and recidivism and improve community safety. Currently, quite frankly, not enough is known about what is really working. To make a real dent in the rate of over-representation of Indigenous Australians within our justice systems, we need to invest in programs that make a difference.

And, if that is the case, how many security checks will this equate to?

In fact, from 2001 to the current time ASIO has received an additional $352.4 million, and that is a 562 per cent increase. Just in our period in office, since 2007-08, ASIO has received an additional $123.6 million, or a 42.4 per cent increase. In the context of that resourcing, I can tell you the resourcing is justified. I see their work on a daily basis. Of course, it is necessary to persuade the community that their funds are being used appropriately.
                                                                                                                                                         </p>

So there is an increase in their overall budget. But, of those savings, $8.8 million over four years will be addressed through risk based reprioritisation of overseas training. There will be $5.3 million over four years for more accurate recoupment security assessments carried out on applications for maritime and airport security identification cards—in other words, increasing the charge. In terms of the issue of security assessments, before I come to the issue of illegal maritime arrivals, there will be savings of $6.9 million over four years achieved through risk based targeting of additional security checking for visa applicants other than unlawful maritime arrivals. I should say unlawful maritime arrivals will also be the subject of mandatory security checks, but that saving measure does not relate to unlawful maritime arrivals.

That is effectively by undertaking a triaging process. It is a security process that has been designed and is managed by ASIO. ASIO is still involved in all steps of the process. Essentially, it enables ASIO to focus more closely on those cases that require attention, and that is what is occurring.

That is not the case. There will be some assessments that can be undertaken quite quickly because the issues are not complex, given the nature of the circumstances, but there will be other circumstances. Given that it is not uncommon for these people to arrive without papers—indeed it is probably more common than not—there can be significant work in undertaking a proper security assessment. ASIO makes no apologies whatsoever for the fact that some of those assessments will take a considerable period of time. While they work hard to undertake those as quickly as possible, the bottom line is that they do not take any shortcuts when it comes to properly evaluating someone's security, and that is entirely appropriate.

Under the previous conservative government, the previous Attorney-General was well known for his requests for members of the public to approach the security hotline—in fact, he was rather mocked over that issue. Nonetheless, I would ask the Attorney-General: what is the government doing to encourage the community to report suspicious behaviour to the National Security Hotline, and what are the issues that are involved from the government's point of view?

For the record, the former government's initiative has unquestionably been a success and has been continued by the current government. When it comes to national security, law enforcement agencies do rely on the public to report suspicious behaviour. It is often the smallest detail that makes the biggest difference, in that it can often tie pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together. That is why the government continues to support, and raise awareness of, the National Security Hotline. This year the government has allocated $600,000 for continuation of the public information campaign about the hotline.

It found that advertising of the National Security Hotline leads directly to an increase in the total number of calls received and also in the number of calls that are useful to stakeholder agencies—in other words, there is a spike or an increase during those advertising campaigns.

Although the current campaign will not include television advertising, arrangements are in place for a campaign to be launched on air at short notice should the security environment change.

And, in answer to the question from the member for

The campaign's activities will, of course, be undertaken in accordance with the Australian government's guidelines on information and advertising. I am pleased that the campaign has attracted bipartisan support, having been endorsed by both sides of parliament—including, obviously, the initiatives of the former government. But I will conclude by commending the member for Melbourne Ports for his contribution to the national security debate and the preparations of this country.

This is not the first time we have seen disruptions in detention centres. There has been a series of disruptions in recent times—indeed, in June 2000, under the Howard government, 600 broke out of mainland detention centres. These are issues that are quite challenging for law enforcement agencies. The AFP, however, have dealt with these issues very well.
                                                                                                                                                             </p>

That was a quick response by the AFP to ensure that there are consequences for people breaking state and federal laws. That matter will now be determined, as is proper, by the courts. The AFP are a very professional outfit. They have done great work and shown great judgment in determining exactly how they should respond to these matters, no matter how difficult it has been. I am relieved that there have been so few injuries, despite the breadth of some of these disruptions. I think that is in no small part is due to the professional response of the AFP and officers.

There are people who are in the position to do so from Perth—the member for Stirling's own home city—and that is to ensure that, if there are any subsequent disruptions, then they will be dealt with appropriately.

We saw 600 people break out of mainland detention centres in June 2000. These are issues that are challenging to law enforcement agencies and to other agencies, including the department of immigration and their contractor Serco. I am very happy that this matter has now been quelled, that the AFP have done their job and that normalcy has resumed on the island. That is a very good thing for the clients, the contractors and the departmental staff who work in the facility.

Does the foreign minister accept the statement by the former PNG Prime Minister that the proposal would be made to work if the foreign minister travelled to PNG and took control of negotiations? I note that in media reports a spokesman for the foreign minister said that he has no plans to travel to PNG in the near future. Why not?

These matters were canvassed in the broadest terms in discussions I had with Sir Michael when I visited him prior to his surgery in Singapore. We had an extensive discussion which covered a whole range of internal matters within PNG and a whole range of foreign policy interests where Papua New Guinea and Australia have common concern, as well as this matter, of course. But I emphasise to the honourable member that this conversation was held at a high degree of generality with a view to specific negotiations then occurring in

What I have said on the public record through my office is accurate. I do not have any plans immediately to visit Papua New Guinea, because I am deeply concerned about the current fragile state of domestic political debate within that country. We have to be very mindful of the particular profile which Australia has within that country and therefore acutely mindful of any impact that we would unnecessarily have as they work their way through their own constitutional and political processes. It is for those reasons that in the very immediate future I do not propose to visit. I am always open to the possibility of visiting. I have many friends and longstanding colleagues right across the Papua New Guinea government. I have been engaged with that country for many, many years. But, because of that, I am very mindful of when it is wise to be there and when it may be wise not to be there.

This seemed to begin with the unrest in Egypt in January and was followed by the unrest in Libya, which resulted in the closure of our consulate in Tripoli and the evacuation of Australian nationals, including our diplomatic staff. At the same time as the Libya crisis was unfolding, there was an earthquake in Christchurch followed by a tsunami in Japan on 11 March which led to a nuclear situation at Fukushima power plant. Minister, from the inquiries that I received at my electorate office, which were overwhelmingly laudatory in terms of the conduct of your department in those posts, and supported by reports in the electronic and print media, I would be interested to know how the department responded to this unprecedented set of consular emergencies.

We had a fair bit of that in the last 12 months or so. Also, we have sought through the department and my office to respond as rapidly as possible to any concerns raised by any member of parliament concerning their constituents who find themselves in difficulty abroad.

Our embassy in Cairo acquitted itself well. The crisis operations centre on Egypt ran from 28 January to 14 February in support of Australians caught up in that crisis. In the case of Libya, an operations centre ran from 22 February to 7 March. In the case of Christchurch, a centre ran for an extensive period as well. It is important to bear in mind the number of calls for information which the department has had to respond to in this period of time.

Over 400 Australians assisted to depart crisis areas, and that was on chartered flights from Egypt. We provided financial assistance to some 400 other Australians, including to assist them to depart the crisis zone. Over 11,000 Australians or residents were confirmed as safe.

In total, for these various consular crises we have deployed 89 additional DFAT staff from other posts, and this has made it very possible for us to undertake the task with which we had been charged. I also commend the department's increasing use of social media to provide advice to Australians where it has been possible to do so given that in some cases—namely Egypt—there were interruptions to the ability to deliver social media services.

They are a first-class group of professionals, and at a peak response time you had over 120 people working on the crisis each day, roughly the equivalent of two DFAT divisions. It is worthwhile saying at this point also in response to the honourable member's question that, when we surge for a major consular crisis around the world, what happens is that we actually take people from their regular responsibilities. As a result, you have a skeleton staff dealing with the normal functional and policy responsibilities of the foreign ministry, while everyone basically rallies to the pump to deal with the challenge of the day. When I visited the consular crisis centre myself during the major consular operations in Egypt and elsewhere, including in Japan, I saw staff who were drawn from policy level, the administrative level, the consular level itself and administrative assistants, frankly deployed from hither and thither, from the most senior to the least senior, all staffing the phones in order to do the right thing by Australians. So I would take this opportunity in this consideration in detail to underline the absolute professionalism of what our consular staff have done.

That is additional funding of $4 million for the upcoming year to improve our consular services, and we will use those resources to more widely extend our use of social media. Finally, if we look to the year ahead we should be very mindful of the rolling instability in the

When a natural disaster hits, the ability to rapidly deploy puts all the department's resources into the field and we need to be constantly in mind of what further supplementation the department needs in order to undertake that in the future given the rising spate of natural disasters right across the

Is it proposed that Australian high commission staff or other Australian staff will provide ongoing support and oversight under the so-called Malaysian solution to ensure that the human rights of these asylum seekers are upheld? Has the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised the foreign minister that additional resources will be required in the high commission to manage the asylum seeker arrangement, and if so how much? What mechanisms will be put in place for our high commission staff to respond to any reports of any human rights violations?

Most regions and the countries within them have reached the very practical conclusion that it is not possible to deal with asylum seekers and unauthorised people movements simply by dint of the effort of an individual national jurisdiction; it requires a regional response.

That conference had the representation from several dozen heads of government from around the world, 40 or 50 foreign ministers as well as the permanent representatives right across the United Nations system. We were there to do a substantive piece of work—we did. I would draw her attention to the final declaration of the UN General Assembly. It achieved significant progress particularly in one area, committing the nations of the world to a new and I believe deliverable target if we could all collectively get our act together: to reduce maternal to child transmission of HIV-AIDS to zero by 2015, and through the proper deployment of antiretrovirals around the world we are capable of doing that.

Simply because not only have we done substantive good work in that multilateral conference, and I pay particular commendation to our permanent representative Gary Quinlan for his first-class work, it has the consequence in terms of Australia's credentials to undertake other responsibilities within the United Nations system that people look long and hard at what Australia has done and say this is a commendable multilateral effort.

The British government together with Australia are two governments around the world which are currently increasing their overseas development assistance, contrary to the trend that you see in many other European countries off the back of the global financial crisis, and I publicly commended the British government for so doing.

Particularly on this initiative of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, Britain announced a further contribution of $1.3 billion at the conference, which I attended, while I indicated that Australia would increase its allocation from a previously announced A$60 million to A$200 million, which is now worth a bit more in US dollars, as we all around this place know full well.

The experts in the field advise that, through the contribution of A$200 million we fund 7.1 million vaccinations; that is, by interventions on the normal trajectory of these diseases that are covered across the pentavalent spectrum and the new vaccine categories dealing with pneumococcal against pneumonia and secondly rotavirus against diarrhoea we through the Australian effort will save the lives of 200,000 children.

That is the number of kids whose lives are being saved through these Australian taxpayer dollars. The further question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes to my authorisation for making such an allocation. That lies within the discretion of the minister responsible for Australia's international aid budget, and I so exercised that discretion and I believed exercised it in the correct direction.

Namely, how do you maintain global and regional democratic norms against a military coup which has done the following: first, suspended the constitution; second, sacked the independent judiciary; third, incarcerated various people who give the regime difficulty; fourth, suspended elections and said that they might hold them in 2014; and fifth, on top of that, breaking up conferences of religious leaders because they are seen to be a threat to the regime. We continue to maintain contact with the Fijian regime through the normal channels. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that our policy is isolated. It is one which is supported in terms of the suspension of Fiji from the

How did the Australian government assist the southern Sudanese in their push for independence and are they receiving any ongoing support?

This follows a protracted period of more than half a century of civil war in the Sudan between what is essentially a Muslim north and a Christian south—an Arab north and an African south. This has been the dividing line of tensions within that country for decades. As a consequence, a peace process was initiated over the course of the last decade which finally resulted in a resolution on which the community of the southern Sudanese, from memory some 10 million voters, voted both within Sudan and included the Sudanese community around the world. By the way, in the great tradition of Australian democracy, the Sudanese community here were the single largest voting bloc of Sudanese citizens outside of Sudan. The bloc here voted like they did in Sudan: 99.9 per cent for an independent state of southern Sudan, and we are still tracking down the others. As a consequence, this new nation state is coming into being.

As with all new and emerging fragile states, we wish to be its partners for long-term development and for long-term peace and we will continue to stand by them. In conclusion, it should be borne in mind that a number of the southern Sudanese who have been taken in as asylum seekers in this country, have been granted permanent residency status and have been educated in Australian institutions will now be returning to Sudan to form parts of the administration of this newly emerging democracy.

I asked a series of questions about the closing down of the tuberculosis clinics, so I ask the foreign affairs minister to answer those questions.

If so, when did the Queensland government first raise with this government its need for additional funding for that purpose? Is the foreign affairs minister aware that the

My question is in two parts, and it is quite detailed. I note in this respect that Australia and Japan created and closely supported the work of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament. The report of this commission made a timely and valuable contribution to shaping outcomes from the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of

This incident has amply demonstrated, 25 years after Chernobyl, that more needs to be done to improve nuclear safety standards and crisis response mechanisms. Before I get to the question, I would just like to add that today I met with diplomats from the Japanese mission. They were doing courtesy calls in the parliament to thank us for how we had responded throughout the crisis that they have suffered, which was very nice.

It is not just thoughtful, it is practical. Unlike many such reports, it goes down to the nuts and bolts of what changes need to be made through the established mechanisms of the international community—for example, the

If you go into the Conference on Disarmament and ask what has been on the agenda recently, the answer is not much. In fact, it is one of the rolling disgraces of the international community. And the reason is that consensus has not been achieved in bringing specific recommendations from elsewhere in the international community, such as the NPT review conference, onto the formal agenda of that body. So what we have done, through the non-proliferation and disarmament initiative group of foreign ministers co-chaired by me and my Japanese colleague, is issue a statement making it plain to the rest of the international community that, if the CD does not achieve an outcome on this by year's end, we will formally seek to move the FMCT negotiations to a different forum. This does not often happen in the international community, but that is what we are proposing to do—whether it is the UN First Committee or elsewhere.

And we will be presenting that as a joint effort between ourselves and the Japanese soon.

Can the minister detail the decision-making process in which countries are chosen or how individuals are awarded scholarships? What post-scholarship follow-up is undertaken to make certain that the individual returns to their country of origin and what monitoring processes are in place to evaluate the total effectiveness of the scholarship program and also individual effectiveness? What are the completion rates of these scholarships? Are there countries that have lower completion rates? What processes are put in place to address low completion rates? I also note that there has been a decrease in aid funding to Burma. That has been reduced in the budget. Yet aid to

Who administers the particular money associated with UN Women? Is there an expectation that there will be reasonable input from Australia and the Pacific region in the process, given particularly that in the Pacific region only two per cent of all elected leaders are women?

I thank her for her question. The government commissioned this independent review because there has not been such an independent review conducted of the entire Australian aid budget since 1996. Fifteen years is a long time between drinks and we thought it was time to have a go at this and put together a body which would evaluate the program from top to tail. It has presented its report to the government. We expect to make our response to the report known in due course after we have examined all of its recommendations and what it means for any structural changes in the future direction of the aid portfolio.

We look forward to making our response to the independent review of aid effectiveness in, as I said, due season. The second part of the honourable member's question goes to whether it would result in adjustments to the currently budgeted aid allocation for 2011-12. We do not foresee that occurring. We have indicated what we would do in the budget. We have obviously made provision for the one thing which often presents us with real challenges in a given year, which is the spate and intensity of natural disasters that are always unpredictable. But absent something catastrophic occurring within that category, we propose to adhere to the budget which is already outlined in the budget papers.

Her specific question to me related to the investment which we are making into health services within PNG. My understanding is that we are investing in the vicinity of $40 million within the overall framework of a program between $400 million and $500 million to PNG. I stand to be corrected on whether that amount includes the significant program we have on

It is very difficult to obtain official statistics other than that infection rates there are potentially frightening. I have said this in the past, when I was on the other side of the aisle and Foreign Minister Downer was in office, that I make no particular criticism of the challenges which have been encountered on the ground in the implementation of the HIV-AIDS program in particular under the period of the conservative government and under our government. This is difficult and hard work, because we are dealing with fundamental attitudinal changes particularly on the part of males.

We actually think, though this was established by 'Pig-Iron Bob', this was a very good thing for Australia. Most things are fully accounted for in the full course of history; this was a good thing. It started in the 1950s under Menzies and was rolled out through until effectively the end of the 1970s. The problem was subsequent to that, and this is no criticism either of the previous Liberal or Labor governments, it languished.

Globally around 30 per cent of women and children experience physical or sexual violence during their lifetime. The Australian government has zero tolerance for violence against women and has committed to reducing violence against women in Australia as well as contributing to international efforts to end violence against women in our region and globally. I know from conversations with the foreign minister that he personally has taken a big interest in this area. Can the foreign minister provide examples of how Australian aid affects women on the ground in developing countries.

I do not say this as a partisan comment. I am just saying it is real and central, because unless you have women and girls educated then, frankly, the international community and developing countries are deprived of a huge asset in economic productivity, employment growth and overall economic development. Secondly, that will never happen unless girls are properly educated, and they are not being properly educated in so many developing countries around the world. Thirdly, it does not happen if women and girls suffer either the threat of or the reality of physical and sexual violence. This is a problem of great significance across many countries which are recipients of Australia's overseas development assistance.

So we intend to partner with her and her institution into the future.

On the question of education of girls, which relates to empowering women with the knowledge of how to deal with threats of violence as well, the Australian government's current allocation is something like 18 to 19 per cent of the entire aid portfolio allocation for education. We regard this as No. 1 in terms of what Australia can productively do in the world, and within that the education of girls is right up there.

That is why we are rolling out a $1 billion program, begun by the Howard government, to construct 4,000 schools to invest massively in the teacher training associated with those schools, in training the principals of those schools, as well as in reforming the curriculums of those schools, in partnership with Indonesian national organisations such as Muhammadiyah and

And so many girls in parts of rural Indonesia are not given any opportunities at all. If those girls and those women are empowered by giving them for the first time the opportunity for an education, it affects their ability to also stand on their own two feet in dealing with challenges of violence as well. Therefore, our response must be holistic. Economic empowerment through microfinance and microcredit is also important.

It is the right thing for Australia, because unless we get the challenge of girls and women around the world right on violence, on sexual violence, on trafficking, on education, as well as empowerment through governance and women obtaining greater positions of responsibility, the development challenge of our world will not be met.

In consultation with our good friends around the world, our friends and allies, including Israel, our attitude to the Durban II conference was to attend up until such time as we could not bring practical influence to bear to change the conference documents decisively. I think it is generally regarded and accepted by participating countries, including a number which the honourable member has just referred to, that the influence which Australia had on the early parts of the draft of the declaration of Durban II, any positive influence was exercised by us physically around the table. However, when the inimitable and inevitable Ahmadinejad took to the podium Australia did, as we have always done, withdraw from the gathering. What we do at the

In fact, we usually lead the walkout. Certainly in the case of the Durban conference, once Ahmadinejad took to the stage I am advised, given that I was not there, that we not only exited the conference on that occasion, we exited the conference period. I stand to be corrected on the absolute detail.

We have not made a decision at this stage but our approach will be very much the same as Durban II. We will seek to work with the process and will seek to influence and shape it to the extent that we can. If it heads in the same direction as last time we will exit the process as we did last time. I do not believe that Australia's efforts in that particular respect were subject of any legitimate criticism by those around the world who defend the interests of the government of Israel and the Jewish people. As I said, we have taken no firm decisions on this that I am aware of and I will certainly keeps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition well informed.

I do not think the member for Hotham ever got the chance he deserved as leader of the opposition. I certainly supported him back then against the member for Werriwa but it looks like he will get the chance next time and I am very pleased. He was the only Labor leader never to be able to face an election and was a very cruel cutting-down too early in an otherwise glittering political career. So I look forward to his opportunity to rise to the top of the podium.

As the member would probably be aware, we accepted all of the recommendations of the Orgill report. There was an issue at the time—Victoria was resistant to putting information out. Its argument was that the information Brad Orgill was seeking was commercial-in-confidence or could have affected the contracts—I forget which specific reason they gave. Nevertheless, at the time I insisted that Victoria make that information available and they did.
                                                                                                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                Thereafter, the question for Mr Orgill was: once you have it, why do you not simply publish it in the raw form? His argument was that it needed to be put in a form that would enable proper comparisons. I know, for example, that comparisons were made about what one hall cost versus another. But if you actually looked at the detail, whilst both might have been referred to as 'gymnasiums', some places chose, because of the sort of work that they were doing, to have sprung floors—they were entitled to have that provided it fitted within the budget. So the unit cost of that type of thing compared with another was clearly going to be different. What Mr Orgill was very keen to do was to make sure that he got a nationally consistent position. I have not held the portfolio since then, but I am advised that the framework was published in January and that the costs for 3,200 schools have been published so far. All 22 education entities have published and will continue to do so.

Minister, I would be very interested to know your views, on behalf of the government, on the draconian legislation that is set to become law in New South Wales, that will go to the heart and soul of hard-working public servants in New South Wales and that will severely affect their security. I would be very grateful if the minister would bring us up to speed, because I see that the conservatives have learnt absolutely nothing. They would doubtless return to that agenda if they were ever to occupy the treasury bench in this place in future.

He has raised this with me. Whilst I would not go so far as to say it is a national disgrace at this stage, it is certainly a state disgrace. It has the potential to become a national disgrace if the same crowd ever sit on the treasury bench in the national parliament. I think it is really important to understand the significant policy reforms that have been put in place by this government to lift the prosperity of the people who work but also to secure and sustain the prosperity of the nation. One cannot do that unless one makes the investments in the essential drivers of productivity—in education, in skills, in infrastructure. We came to office with a massive deficiency on all these three fronts and we set about redressing that. The global financial crisis gave us a very important opportunity through the stimulus package to put money into these areas that underpin the growth of a nation—importantly, into training, infrastructure and skills development.

Labor governments have consistently sought a framework in which that partnership is encouraged in the workplace through the enterprise, and that requires core fundamentals in terms of the industrial relations framework. It requires the recognition of the right of employees to collectively bargain. It requires the recognition that, in a bargaining framework, that bargaining must take place in the spirit of good faith. And it requires, if it is to really work, that in the absence of agreement through bargaining in good faith there is resort to an independent umpire. They are fundamentals, and we will fight till the last drop of our blood to ensure that those principles are always secured.

They were defeated, and an essential element of the cause of their defeat was Work Choices. People woke up to what it was doing. It was taking away their dignity. It was stripping their standards of living. We campaigned on the basis of changing it and we won. We set about changing it and introduced Fair Work Australia. Since that time, despite their dire predictions of job losses, wage outbreaks and breakouts in industrial disputes, none of it has happened. In fact, the opposite has happened: strong job growth and strong reduction in industrial disputes.

I simply point out that this is supposed to be consideration in detail of the federal government's appropriations and I am not sure why talking about industrial matters at the state level could be regarded as being relevant to this debate. While I understand that the minister is filling up his time with these kinds of irrelevancies in order to avoid having to be questioned about the budget, I would ask you as chair to draw him back to the fact that this is consideration in detail of the government's appropriations bill. I would not have pointed it out except that he was so unkind to me at the beginning of his last contribution! I was prepared to let it go before that!

We note that historic benchmarking is a complex exercise and would need to take into account regional variations, and DEEWR has commenced preparation of documentation for the open tender process to determine the custodian of the BER-CAM database. The handover will coincide with the termination of the task force in 2011.

The Taskforce recommends that the government education authorities review their approach to school master planning and engagement of school communities in this process.

If that detail causes concern to the other side, there is something wrong with them.

He also said that the only reason he was forced to make those comments was that I was being unkind to him. Well, I always thought that accurate descriptions were very kind. and I think that the member should reflect.

I have now got the answer to the one that was asked before that. There has been a discussion with the education authorities—the government has met with all 22 education authorities—and a paper is being finalised for tabling later this year.

It has been discussed with the education authorities during early drafting. I might say that that was a recommendation I was particularly interested in. I think it is fair to say that the best value for money was obtained in circumstances in which there was active engagement between school communities and the appropriate education authorities.

We think it is a very important part of the ongoing process to engage the school communities, but there has to be an overall framework in terms of what we expect them to respond to. So that is the paper that is being discussed. I would also just point out that, of the 9½ thousand schools and the 24,000 projects, only a little over 300 complaints were received by the task force set up for the whole purpose of investigating complaints and recommending to government how the program could be improved for the future.

They concern the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, which was announced in the budget and was very well received in my electorate of Reid. Firstly, I would like the minister to outline for the benefit of the House the government's thinking behind that initiative. Secondly, I note that that package includes changes to allow jobseekers on youth allowance to keep more of what they earn, and some adjustments to the taper rates for Newstart allowance, and I would be grateful if the minister could elucidate how that works.

I talked before about the stimulus package that we as a government entered into and which saw this economy, the only developed country in the world, avoid the recession. Part of the reason for that stimulus package was to invest in activities that in part were about creating job activity. The

As a government we have made a commitment to lift year 12 retention rates and we have made a commitment to lift the proportion of people with diploma qualifications and with higher education qualifications. Why are we doing this? Because all the evidence suggests that a nation lifts its productivity if its lifts its educational attainment. There is a productivity dividend for such an investment. So physical infrastructure is very important because these are the buildings in which people get taught and learn. It is not just the BER program and the big investment through the secondary schools in science and language labs, which you would be aware within your own electorate, but also the trade training centres, which the minister who will come after this session will be able to talk about as well.

We invested $560 million in the National Workforce Development Fund, which will give industry a decision making capacity for substantial Australian government investment in workforce development. Why is this important? Because we know that, having avoided the recession and still on the wave of a significant resources boom, one of the capacity constraints we have to avoid is skill shortages. If we do not equip ourselves to train people properly here, the only other alternative is to look at doing it through migration programs. It is far better for a country to use the physical facilities to invest in the training activities being undertaken. This is a significant investment in working with industry to identify the skill shortage areas and then seeking to address them. I might also say that in my portfolio responsibility of regional development we want to take that exercise local. So there will be active engagement by Regional Development Australia, the bodies at the regional level, to help us identify what the skill shortages are in the particular regions and develop packages accordingly. That is a very important development.

I can advise the House that the initiatives presented in the budget included allowing young job seekers on youth allowance to keep more of what they earn through increasing the income free area from $62 to $143 per fortnight, increasing the working credit from $1,000 to $3,500 and in addition providing a more generous income test taper rate for single principal carers on Newstart allowance from 1 January 2013. This means that parents will be able to earn up to $400 per fortnight, on top of the $946 per fortnight that they currently earn before their income support payment is taken out.

The option for them is either work or training. Unemployment should not be an option. There are important new initiatives in this budget that will help secure that outcome for them—good for them; good for the nation.

It concerns the Building Australia's Future Workforce program, which we have mentioned in this session, and in particular the wage subsidy for the very long-term unemployed. This announcement states that employers will be encouraged to hire the very long-term unemployed—two-plus years—by offering to give employers the amount of Newstart payment that the job seeker would have otherwise received, and this payment will be offset for six months.

What assurances can you give us that this will not involve the turning over, the churning, of workers given that we see these examples all around us now with traineeships being suddenly abandoned after the necessary—usually six-month—period is over. The amount of money that will be offered, this six months of Newstart, is quite significant. My first question concerns assurances that there will be something to prevent exploitation of what could be seen as quite a lucrative exercise for some unscrupulous employers.
                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                               My second question concerns part-time work. Are the provisions for this employment under this program to be for part-time work or would the employer that took advantage of it have to hire the person on a full-time basis? Let us assume that there is provision for part-time employment: will the payment be pro rata or will the business still receive the full wage subsidy at the rate of Newstart for six months? It is simply not clear. If you hire a part-time worker or a three-quarter-time worker, would you get a similar pro rata amount of Newstart? There are my three questions around this particular budget measure.

We are incredibly proud of the measures in this budget which are specifically aimed at the very long-term unemployed. We know that when we head towards projections of a 4.5 per cent unemployment rate it spells great promise for many Australians, but we want to make sure that people are not left out.

One of those measures is the provision of 35,000 wage subsidies. I think I will take the second question first. The amount will be the equivalent of the Newstart payment approximately, but it is flexible and we can work with those needs around part time and full time and for how long that subsidy is required.

We already operate wage subsidies at the moment. We operate wage subsidies under the

We obviously monitor the employers who are accessing this. We monitor the job seeker, where they go and how they continue post wage subsidy. We have in place strict protections to make sure that we do not see the sort of turnover which the member referred to. Does that mean that every job seeker continues on in that role in the long term after the subsidy ends? No, it does not. Some of them do not see it through for the six months. But it does mean that we monitor that through our department. We put in place every protection that we can.

This is really important and it comes back to the question around part time and full time and the capacity to work. We will have these subsidies at an equivalent rate. It works out at around $6,000 for each job seeker. The way that that is put in place is obviously going to differ from position to position. The other measure which complements this is the $133 million which we have put into increased participation requirements on the very long-term unemployed. We know that not everybody is job ready, not everybody has maintained the skills, the confidence, the discipline and the whole range of things they need in order to step straight into employment. That is why we are extending the participation from six months to 11 months. We want to make sure that we are training up, that we are skilling, that we are preparing and getting job ready all of these job seekers. We know that the wage subsidies have been proven, through the model that already exists and through the wage subsidies that we already operate, as being one of the most effective ways that we can move the very long-term unemployed into employment.

How might that be funded and how might it work in practice? The current level of Work for the Dole activities—as I will call them generically—is extremely low. If not, what types of work experience activities do you think will be utilised to make sure that that number of long-term unemployed job seekers actually does have an opportunity to meet their mutual obligation requirements?

I know that the opposition like to speak about Work for the Dole as the participation requirement. Under our system, Work for the Dole is one option, and it means that in addition to Work for the Dole people can participate through skills-based work experience. My colleague has already talked about the major investment that we are making in skills. People can participate in job trials, they can participate in work experience or they can participate in Work for the Dole. That will be funded through $133 million. We recognise that it does take money to provide participation activities, which is why we are providing that money per job seeker who will be accessing that. We expect that, of course, some of that money will go towards Work for the Dole.

We do know that, whilst we continue absolutely to support Work for the Dole, our focus is on making sure that we are getting people off income support and into jobs and that we are using the best activity and the best participation requirements to get them to do that. December 2010 data indicates that over 60 per cent of job seekers who have undertaken education and training activities are in a job or studying three months after completing that activity. By comparison, only 35 per cent of job seekers who have participated in Work for the Dole have moved into work or further study. So we think it is really important that we actually look at the evidence and that we recognise that Work for the Dole has an important role and it will continue to have an important role, but it is not a one-size-fits-all solution and we need to make sure that there is flexibility in the system for employment providers to come up with the best activity to match those needs. That is the reason why this money will be provided in the same flexible way that the employment service providers will be able to absolutely direct that money into Work for the Dole, or they will be able to choose to direct it into other participation activities which they think might be more beneficial to that job seeker.

I commend both ministers on their endeavours in this area, particularly their faith in that labour market and understanding it is, after a downtime, to make sure people are prepared to come out of the bad times so that the labour market is trained and ready to go. I think we have learnt from some of those errors in the past—rather than just let the market rip. It is good to see that people in this parliament do have faith in markets as the way to achieve some of these things. I say that particularly as a Queenslander, because certainly some of the Beattie government's focus on that 'earning and learning' message is something that has translated into actions in this parliament.

Some of those figures are a shock to see. Whilst we are the envy of the globe in terms of having unemployment with a four in front of it, some of those long-term unemployment figures are still going up, which is obviously something we need to change. We need to move the dignity of work into the households in some of our poorer suburbs. I can think of suburbs in my electorate where people are almost getting into the third generation of unemployment. There are no positive role models, no opportunities to break free.

They have been designed to confront the problem of young people who are neither working or studying; what figure does the government have to show the extent of the problem in these respects?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I thank the member for his question. The very long-term unemployed have been a nagging problem for this country. I was the minister responsible in the Keating government, and the Working Nation program was actively engaged in getting these people back into a workforce, while the nation was recovering from a recession. This exercise should be relatively easy in comparison, given that we have had no recession—in fact, we are the only developed country that avoided the recession. Nevertheless, these figures still show that there is a consistent problem there with people who have not had engagement with the workforce. It presents another barrier to engagement with the workforce.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So we have this conundrum. We have a potential skills shortage looming. We have a demand side and we have a potential supply side. To give you an idea of the extent of the figures: as at October 2010, 10.7 per cent of 15- to 24-year-olds were not in employment, education or training. That is around 320,000 people. Of those 320,000 people, 170,000 have not been in employment, education or training for 12 months. That is a wasted resource, given the challenge that we are facing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In the Indigenous population, it is around 10 per cent—that is, 10 per cent of those not in employment, education or training are Indigenous. Of those figures that I have talked about, the over 11 per cent youth unemployment is much higher than the national average, as you pointed out. Almost half of young Australians who left youth allowance in September 2010 have been on these payments for more than a year.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So the challenge for us is: how do we better match that supply potential with the demand? That is why the budget concentrated on these measures to improve study and work incentives. There has been, as a result of the budget, greater incentive to work. I talked about that increase in youth allowance recipients in the income-free area. There will be greater incentive to study. That is important because we want to lift the retention rates. There will be more responsibility to complete year 12. We think again it comes back to this concept of mutual obligation. If we are prepared to commit the resources, those for whom they are targeted have a responsibility to take them up; they do not have the responsibility to stay away from work opportunities or training. We also have more incentives in there to give people the chance to attain basic skills. There will be more support out of this budget to transition to employment; there will be more support to manage the challenge of teen parenting, because this becomes an important issue in terms of family relationships; and there will be more support for families with children to help them stay at school.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is a truly comprehensive package. We are doing it for two reasons. We are doing it because we believe that everyone should have the opportunity not just to enter the workforce but to be equipped with the skills to have a greater array of choice when they are exercising the opportunities for employment. So it is important for opportunity for the individual, but it is also important for the nation. If we are to avoid the constraint of skill shortages which have bedevilled us in the past, it is an absolute requirement for government to ensure that, for everyone who is capable of working, who wants to work, or who cannot work because they do not have the skills, every one of those categories is covered, and the suite of measures contained in this budget do just that.

I assume that this minister will have a better grasp of the portfolio than his predecessor in the consideration in detail. I have so many questions I could ask the minister about his unravelling portfolio, but I intend to start with the Australian Baccalaureate. I have a series of questions which I will ask for five minutes, and then he might want to answer them or take them on notice and answer them all at the end. Each minister usually makes their own decision about how they wish to handle it.

Such an outcome may be undesirable.

First, has the nature of expert advice provided to government changed since 2006 such that it has led your government to decide that a baccalaureate-style certificate in Australia is desired? Second, how will the government ensure that existing state and territory qualifications are not be seen to be of a lower status after the Australian baccalaureate is introduced? Third, if the Australian baccalaureate is to provide at a price tag of $7.3 million rigorous certificates that are academic in nature only for high-achieving students, what are the benefits for other young people, who do not intend to pursue tertiary study?

I think that our commitment to introduce an Australian baccalaureate and our reasons for wanting to do that go to the heart of the significant and bold education reforms that this government is undertaking.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>

I will take on notice the questions about research and patent information and whether there has been interaction between the department, the government and others and the baccalaureate organisation in Geneva.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       On the shadow minister's other questions, I make the following points. I was recently lucky enough to spend time with principals and teachers who are very aware of the fact that in years 11 and 12 they have students who are contemplating study at institutions or universities in other parts of the world and/or who have been subject to moving from country to country over time. It is the case that baccalaureates are offered here which have an international component but which do not specifically link in with the curriculum that we have in Australia and that an Australian baccalaureate is seen as being an extremely important initiative in order to meet that structural deficiency. The Australian baccalaureate will be developed by ACARA, and the shadow minister would be aware of ACARA's achievements to date—they are considerable. They will develop that baccalaureate in partnership with the state and territory education authorities.

I also know that the complete suite of measures that we have in place as a government are about our developing a national approach to education which suits our national needs. The fact is that, for many long years in government, the now opposition had the opportunity to take a national approach to education, and they fudged it completely—they missed doing it altogether. Our commitment, on the other hand, is a significant one in terms of doing that. As the shadow minister knows, we now have a national curriculum underway. We now have national standards for teachers.

We also have a most significant investment—nearly double the investment that we saw previously under the coalition—across a suite of education measures which were introduced by the Prime Minister when she was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, and it is my great pleasure to be able to continue with those reforms.

I think this is something which most reasonable people listening to this debate would recognise as a very worthy measure.

I spoke to almost everyone there on the night, and there were probably 100 people. Without exception, they all applauded the government's commitment of an additional $200 million-plus to the School Chaplaincy Program and were very pleased to know that the program is to be continued for the next three years. Minister, firstly, how is the program being received? But perhaps more importantly, what kind of feedback are you getting in respect of the chaplaincy service that is being provided in the schools and what kind of demand is coming back to you in respect of that service?

My experience reflects the member's experience, which is that there is a strong demand for this program. It is a voluntary program and schools need to determine whether or not they wish to secure the services of a chaplain. When they do that, the guidelines make it very clear that it is not the purpose of the chaplain to proselytise a particular position, dogma or faith but, rather, to provide pastoral support to students and additional support for teachers. A teacher may encounter students within the school community who are experiencing troubling times at home or whatever it might be, and the chaplains are there to take some of that burden from the teachers. The teachers are there to teach and the chaplains are there to provide pastoral support.

The program is well supported and it provides pastoral care and support to students within the school environment, which is appropriate.

From 1 January next year we will extend that program to up to 3,700 schools, which I think is a significant contribution by the government. It is the case that a review of the chaplaincy program is underway, and I will consider carefully the advice that comes through to me in terms of the consultations that have fed into the review. One of the things I think it is important to say is that the work of chaplains should be seen as something complementary to, not a replacement for, the work of others involved in the school and looking after the wellbeing of students and school communities. It is important to make sure that schools are supported in looking after the wellbeing of their students, and that is what this program does.

I would agree that we absolutely want to ensure that the contracts are finalised. The member would be aware that such is our commitment to these budget base funded services that we massively increased the funding for them in last year's budget. We want to make sure that we lift the quality of care right across Australia, and this includes where these budget base funded services operate, which is in the most disadvantaged, most at-risk communities. So I will personally look into why those contracts have not been finalised. But I want to put on the record that this government has shown through last year's budget that we recognise that these services need to be improved. We want to make sure they are improved. We know that this is the best start in life that many of these children have. For members who are not aware, the budget based funded services are services which the government funds in their entirety. We build them, we pay all of the fees, and that is because we know, through all of the international and domestic research, that this is one of the best opportunities that we have to break the cycle of disadvantage. So our commitment there is strong.

To put this into perspective, this is some $13 billion more than the Howard government committed. It is quite phenomenal that there has been a massive increase. We are proud of this. We know that it is really important in order to assist families with affordability and accessibility of child care at the same time as we are going about lifting the quality of child care across Australia.

We have not had any changes of policy to that, and there have been no announcements that go along with that, so we would anticipate that that is where the government's resolve remains.

I would like to record the deep appreciation of the constituents of Reid, whom I represent in this place, for those initiatives. I would also like to say how appreciative my constituents were in relation to other initiatives that were announced in this place just over five weeks ago. Specifically I am referring to the government's More Support for Students with Disabilities program. I have a number of children in my electorate who have been suffering disabilities, some profoundly so. The principals of those children's schools and the families of the students of those schools have expressed to me their deep appreciation for the assistance that our government is giving to them. Also in terms of the payments for great teachers, I think that for a long time teachers who have done such a great job in educating the future citizens of our country have probably felt that they have been neglected by governments of all persuasions. That has been very gratefully received, as has the Teach Next program and any number of initiatives in terms of our

We were able to see the extensive facilities that were being put in place to help these kids realise their dreams of working in vocations that they had a great desire for and a great interest in. That facility was particularly interesting to me because it was one where the Catholic system had also provided a significant contribution so that they could maximise the benefit of the investment that the Commonwealth had provided through the trade training centre program itself. They had looked at a suite of training potentials for their students and they had delivered not only a hospitality area but also a tremendous performing arts space. I was particularly impressed with the way in which they had worked closely with other fellow schools in their system.

They will be able to go into areas of skills and trades which will then allow them to go on and build sustainable working lives for themselves once they leave school. That is really important.

We do have a lot of young Australians who decide to go down a particular skills route. They might do a couple of certs; they might get halfway through the apprenticeship and then we may not see successful completion. The government addressed that in the budget, which had a very strong skills focus, by providing some $200 million—I think $101 million for the mentoring package for apprentices and another $100 million for the accelerated package. That is a way of really focusing on this particular issue. We do know that a better skilled Australian workforce provides us with enduring foundations for long-term sustainability; but it is also important for young people coming into the workforce who perhaps encounter issues or obstacles that they did not quite realise were there. To have mentoring in that situation would be terrifically useful.

But all of the trade training centre facilities that I have seen thus far have been of a very high order. It does mean that the training that takes place in the school environment is training which can be immediately applied and used as people go on to their vocational training journey.

In particular there was $200 million of new funding for support for students with disabilities and special needs. Everybody listening to the broadcast of parliament and everybody reading the record of this debate will know that one of the greatest needs in our school system at this point in time is that felt by the school community wanting to be able to provide the necessary support in the classroom for kids with special needs and disabilities. I think that $200 million was one of the great moments of the education budget in 2011. It has been extremely positively received right across the education sectors from all of those who work in this area and who realise how important it is.

We know that the teacher is the most important person inside the school gate when it comes to providing an effective education for kids. They are the single most important figure there. To develop a nationally consistent performance management system and recognise effective teachers I think is an absolute boon to the profession and it shows that we understand how important providing a great education is. There were many measures in this budget which showed our commitment to providing a great education, and we are proud of all of them.

As a result, we have families that are now trying to get two jobs, students actively deciding not to pursue higher education or training and those who have had to give up their higher education dreams and come home because they cannot actually afford to be in training or at university.

How do these figures compare to the numbers prior to the changes to youth allowance? Of the additional students now accessing independent youth allowance, how many are from inner regional areas and are actually receiving full youth allowance payments? What proportion of the new students accessing youth allowance are receiving independent versus dependent youth allowance?

I also refer the minister to comments made by the member for Parramatta on 30 May that the government is committed to removing eligibility distinctions between inner regional and outer regional students by 1 January 2012: will this happen, and when? And will it be available to current gap year students?

Will this come from the existing pool of funding for youth allowance or will additional funding be applied to the youth allowance program? And will this have an impact on the number of students able to access youth allowance and the actual amount they receive? Thank you.

It will be tabled in both houses within 10 sitting days. Members should be aware that Professor Lee Dow has conducted a number of consultations around Australia. Of the 21 roundtables scheduled, two-thirds of those have been held in regional areas. So organisations, students and families, including those from regional areas, have had a good opportunity to contribute to the review either by attending the consultations themselves or by making a written submission.

We always said we would review the most appropriate mechanism for determining the eligibility. In fact, we did legislate for that.

We know that the latest statistics show that there has already been a 29 per cent increase in higher education in dependent youth allowance recipients from rural and regional areas, and that the government's reforms have benefited more than 85,000 young people who now receive the maximum rate of youth allowance, a higher rate of youth allowance or a payment of youth allowance for the first time. For the member's benefit, this includes almost 29,000 young people from rural and regional areas.

You know what some of them are, including the additional students who are receiving scholarships. There are about 190,000 or so of those, with around 44,000 from rural and regional areas. We have additional initiatives which operate for regional students for improving their university participation: removing the cap in the number of students who can enrol in undergraduate degrees, which means that more students from rural and regional backgrounds will have the opportunity to attend university; establishing a new regional priorities round of the Education Investment Fund; and completing the Structural Adjustment Fund to assist universities, particularly in those regional and outer metropolitan areas, to adapt to the reforms in the demand driven funding system that we have in place. It needs to be clearly stated that the government has also established the $20 million Rural Tertiary Hardship Fund which will provide additional financial assistance to country kids from disadvantaged backgrounds—the first round to be distributed.

These centres all show how the provision of first-class infrastructure and training facilities will enable kids to get on that trade training journey, whether it is in automotive, in electrical, in hospitality or in the creative areas. The fact is that these trades training centres provide the opportunity for us to meet the skills challenges that we will face in the future. In this budget we have significant investment in skills, including Building the Future Workforce, a $3 billion investment over six years. As well as that, we are equipping these young students with every opportunity to go out into a trade and build a fantastic life for themselves and their families and their communities. I very much applaud the approach that has been taken by these schools in making sure that they partner together and deliver a cooperative group to put in for a trades training centre. I appreciate very much the cooperation that we have seen from small business and the business sector generally in making sure that, when kids come from school and continue their training or go into employment, businesses have already been involved with the kids as they have been working and learning in the trades training centres.

We place a lot of focus on skills and participation in the 2011-12 budget, and that is because we know that the opportunities that come with training and learning are absolutely necessary and essential not only to make sure that Australian citizens have got meaningful, good, sustainable work but that we build prosperity in the future. We want to make sure that kids can gain skills that are relevant to the workplace when they are in these trades training centres, and the outstanding level of support that we have had from schools right around Australia tells me that this policy is one that is absolutely to be commended.
