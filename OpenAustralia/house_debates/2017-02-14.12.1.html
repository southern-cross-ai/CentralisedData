       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate those members of the community in my electorate of Wills who were inducted into the Order of Australia on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year. Ms Melanie Raymond
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was recognised for her tireless work with young people, her work in social welfare and contribution to the community over decades. I just visited Youth Projects in Glenroy and saw firsthand the great work she and her team do with employment and education services for young people. Ms Susan Nixon OAM was recognised for her service to women over many decades. The Reverend Alistair Macrae OAM was recognised for his outstanding work and service to the

        </a>
        and in promoting ecumenism, interfaith dialogue and reconciliation. Mr Shane Lapworth OAM was recognised for his outstanding service to the community as a volunteer

        member since 2001â€”although Shane claims it was all Connie Lapworth's work, who is now the actual controller of SES in Broadmeadows.

       <p>
        These people join a select group of inductees to our unique Australian honours system. They are indeed remarkable people and, as their representative in this place, it is my absolute pleasure and honour to thank them for their meritorious service to our community and our nation. It is people like these who make Australia such a wonderful country. I thank them and congratulate them for their wonderful service to Australia and their communities.
