        I must comment on the fact that the Federation Chamber is looking fantastic at the moment. Yesterday, a constituent of mine, Georgina Longhurst, called into my office. Georgina had a transplant 12 months ago and reaching this 12-month anniversary is a real milestone after a kidney transplant. She called into my office to let me know that she is supporting a petition protesting the withdrawal of a drug, Sensipar, from the PBS. This is quite an expensive drug—it costs her $400 a month if she has to pay the full amount of money—and it is vital for her to be able to access this drug because without it her life is in jeopardy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The drug helps to control hormones. It decreases levels of the hyperparathyroid hormone—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTH" rel="nofollow">
         PTH
        </a>
        —as well as calcium and phosphorus in the body. It is used to treat hyperparathyroidism, which is an overreaction to the functioning of the parathyroid gland in people who are having long-term dialysis for kidney disease. Georgina had long-term dialysis before her transplant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Removing this critical drug from the PBS happened recently. I have written to the minister about this as it is something that is vitally important for transplantation recipients. Georgina will not be the only person who has been affected by this. The hormone that is produced by Sensipar is one that really jeopardises her health and the health of tens of thousands of people who have had transplants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other issue I quickly wanted to raise is one that Georgina raised with my office. The

        —the Hunter Medical Research Institute—is having a glow walk on 19 September for the Hunter Transplant Research Foundation. People can register for this at Nobbys surf club. It will take place on Saturday, 19 September. Registration takes place from four o'clock on that day. The first 500 will get a free wristband; T-shirts will be available to purchase on the day. It is a great way for people to get behind and support transplants in the Hunter.
