       <p>
        I am very pleased to speak on this condolence motion for one of my predecessors as the member for Farrer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wal_Fife" rel="nofollow">
         Wal Fife
        </a>
        . Wal was born on 2 October 1929 to Clyde and Myrtle Fife and was a younger brother to Harold. He was educated in Wagga and Canberra and, as has been well documented, had a keen interest in politics that dated back to his childhood. In 1948, aged around 19, he started working in the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, before returning to Wagga in 1949 to join the family business, Fifes Produce Pty Ltd. When only 28 he won the local state seat in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Assembly
        </a>
        , which had previously been a Labor stronghold under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Graham" rel="nofollow">
         Eddie Graham
        </a>
        . He became New South Wales's youngest MP—and this was his third attempt to win the seat. Wal married Marcia Hargreaves Stanley on 31 May 1952. The couple had four children: David, Allan, Carolyn and Sue. They were grandparents of 10 and great-grandparents of nine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Fife was a true son of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        . A gentleman who had always retained his interest in politics, he was always available for good counsel and he was always able to read the political tea leaves. One key project the region must always be grateful for relates to the establishment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt_University" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Sturt University
        </a>
        . It was Wal Fife's vision, determination and dedication that brought about the breakthrough in relation to this vital higher education project. Indeed, this was an issue Wal raised in his maiden speech to the federal parliament in March 1976. Mind you, it was not the first item of business he wished to note. As a state MP of some experience, it is worth noting he took the opportunity to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        staff in his very first address, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think at this time it is appropriate to record one's thanks to the members of the Parliament House staff and the public servants with whom we all come in contact. Those of us who have had experience in the parliamentary field know only too well that no member of Parliament can adequately discharge his responsibilities and duties to his constituents without the full co-operation and assistance of these people.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was truly a very humble entrant to this House. As far as I can ascertain, he also gave no valedictory speech on his departure, so, perhaps, as someone so strict on protocol, Wal was simply ensuring he got in early. As I understand it, a redistribution ended his career rather abruptly.
       </p>
       <p>
        After his vote of thanks, he was down to business commenting on the Whitlam government's Albury-Wodonga Growth Centre project—something that we still remember with fondness in the region today. Then he talked about his concern regarding the need for local tertiary education facilities in his electorate. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The former Government said that it would build a university in the area, but no headway has been made in 3 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Up until the present the Universities Commission has not recommended the establishment of a university for Albury-Wodonga.
       </p>
       <p>
        Serving notice on the new cabinet, at his first opportunity he indicated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I await the outcome of the decisions for university education for the 1977-79 budget period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps a precursor? Wal Fife would become Minister for Education in the Fraser government from December 1979 to May 1982. History now records Wal as remaining a driving force behind the establishment of a university born from a merger of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_College" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell College
        </a>
        of Advanced Education and the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education. I don't think, without Wal Fife's unique understanding of the communities of Wagga and Albury, this would have happened. We finally saw the incorporation of Charles Sturt University in 1989, with campuses opening in Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst and Wagga Wagga. On Wal's passing last month the current
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSU" rel="nofollow">
         CSU
        </a>
        vice-chancellor, Andy Vann, recorded:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Fife was a champion of Charles Sturt University and we are forever indebted to him for his fortitude, vision and commitment in the role that he played in the establishment of our University.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Fife was a life-long advocate for the Riverina and his contribution to public life in Australia is to be commended.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
         The University
        </a>
        recognised Mr Fife's contribution to rural and regional education and his support for Charles Sturt University by awarding him with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Doctor_of_Letters" rel="nofollow">

        in 1993.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fischer" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        also noted that Wal's greatest legacy was the establishment of Charles Sturt University. It was his strategic approach with Dr Cliff Blake, the university's first vice-chancellor, that made the difference. Wal's family can be very proud of that legacy. Tim Fischer, of course, succeeded Wal as the member for Farrer. The local Wagga Wagga paper,

        </i>
        , noted that Wal was an avid collector of political history, keeping about 500 boxes full of documents that crossed his desk throughout his career, giving future researchers a valuable insight into the workings of state and federal governments. Nowadays when prominent people pass it's common to see some negative comments among the positives, especially when the dearly departed is a politician. But there has been none of that with Wal—a gentleman and a statesman who once told

        that there used to be a 'friendlier atmosphere in the chamber, on both sides of the aisle'.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to comment on the

        <i>

        </i>
        's remarks on Wal's passing. Tumbarumba, while no longer in my electorate, used to be, and it is a community of which I am still very fond. He was the federal member representing Tumbarumba for some time. He was a frequent visitor and was known for his success in making representations on behalf of local people with both state and federal issues. Unlike most politicians who had achieved ministerial status, Wal Fife did not accept honours and awards. However, he was proud of his

        —a papal award which was presented to him by the then-archbishop,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pell" rel="nofollow">
         George Pell
        </a>
        . In death, as in life, Wal Fife was at one with the community to which he belonged—no state funeral, and a humble return to the place where he belonged.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have my own fond memories of Wal Fife, a predecessor of mine in the seat of Farrer and he later went on to be the member for Hume after Wagga and Albury were no longer represented in the same electoral division. My fondest memory of him is the enthusiasm with which he greeted me as a candidate for Liberal Party preselection and, later, the candidate running in the seat of Farrer. Of course, my predecessor had been Tim Fischer—someone who I have the greatest respect for, but who came from the Nationals. Wal was very excited at the prospect of Farrer returning to the Liberals. When it did, he was delighted and he offered me much advice. Unfortunately, his health failed in later years and he became a lot quieter, but I know that, while he was here in Canberra with Marcia, he would have fiercely and determinedly watched every step that we all took in this building. The cause of rural liberalism was one that he remained steadfast to.
       </p>

        My Liberal colleague the member for Wagga Wagga,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Maguire" rel="nofollow">
         Daryl Maguire
        </a>
        , gave a beautiful address at Wal's funeral, following the tragic nonappearance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Schipp" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Schipp
        </a>
        , a previous member for the state seat of Wagga Wagga, who we lost that very morning. So I want to commend Daryl for his remarks. I want to thank my colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McCormack" rel="nofollow">
         Michael McCormack
        </a>
        , the member for Riverina, who came to the funeral, and, of course,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Angus Taylor
        </a>
        , as the current member for Hume, for his remarks during this debate, as well as our erstwhile colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Heffernan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . There were many fond stories and many fond exchanges about what seems, from this perspective, a very different time in politics. I wish Marcia and the family all the very best. My sympathies and my condolences are with them all.
