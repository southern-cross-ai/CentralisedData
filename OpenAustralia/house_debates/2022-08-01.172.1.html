        I rise to acknowledge one of my constituents, Merewyn Wright, who recently lost her husband, Stan. Merewyn and Stan have been tireless advocates for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlie_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Airlie Beach
        </a>
        community through their involvement in community organisations like Rotary. They've also been long-time supporters of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal National Party
        </a>
        in Queensland. Merewyn and Stan met while Merewyn was working as a deputy principal in Nanango in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">
         South Burnett
        </a>
        . They married and eventually moved to Airlie Beach, where Merewyn taught until her retirement in 2014. Stan was a keen pilot and active member of the Whitsunday Aero Club. He obtained a general aviation pilot licence back in the early sixties and had a real passion for flying. Stan was a very strong supporter of Merewyn and her work in the community through her involvement in Rotary. I had the pleasure of recognising Merewyn as the

        citizen of the year during the

        </a>
        awards in 2019 while I was mayor. Merewyn has been deeply involved in community events like the Rotary boat show and Carols by the Beach, with Stan always by her side. One of Rotary's biggest community efforts was in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Debbie, which was the second-largest cyclone to make landfall in Australia. The organisation helped locals who had lost everything and worked tirelessly to build our community.

        Stan was Merewyn's friend, husband and staunchest supporter. His contribution to his community will be sorely missed by all.
