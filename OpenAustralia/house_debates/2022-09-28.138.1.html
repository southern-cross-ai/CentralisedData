        I'd like to associate the government's side of the House and express our condolences to Mr Pyne on the death of his mother. He has a lot of friends in the parliament, and we wish him all the best at this sorry time.

        Last week Neighbourhood Houses Tasmania held its state conference in my electorate at Iron Creek Bay Farm Stay in Sorell. The focus for the conference was sustainable living. Unfortunately, owing to a change in the parliamentary sitting schedule I could not attend as planned, which was a shame as I've heard it was a cracking three days. If you don't believe me,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker" rel="nofollow">

        , there's a Facebook video from the flower-power themed conference dinner that proves Tassie's neighbourhood house community know how to have a good time. People have missed the opportunity to see in me in bell-bottom flares and some hippy power shirts. There you go.
       </p>
       <p>
        This seems like the perfect opportunity to take a minute to recognise the important role that neighbourhood houses play in all our communities—I'm sure every member in this House has an excellent relationship with their neighbourhood houses—and to give a shout-out to the dedicated and inspiring staff and volunteers from the neighbourhood houses in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neighbourhood houses are places where people come together and find support, belonging and purpose. There are 35 neighbourhood houses across Tasmania working with our local communities, delivering essential supports and providing opportunities for social inclusion, friendship, outreach and community development. The value that neighbourhood houses provide to communities, especially across rural and regional Australia, cannot be overstated. There are nine neighbourhood houses in my electorate: Fingle Valley Neighbourhood House;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helens" rel="nofollow">
         St Helens
        </a>
        Neighbourhood House; Bridgewater and Gagebrook community houses, run by Jordan River Support Services; Derwent Valley Community House; Dunalley Tasman Neighbourhood House; Midway Point Neighbourhood House; Okines Neighbourhood House; and Deloraine House. Each plays an integral role in their local community, and all their staff and volunteers deserve a shout-out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, I don't have the time to recognise everyone individually, but I will mention some of the amazing work currently being done across Lyons in our neighbourhood houses. The Fingle Valley and St Helens neighbourhood houses, for example, will be working together with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_O'Day" rel="nofollow">

        council to celebrate Seniors Week next month with a free bus trip to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolmers_Estate" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , also in my electorate, and a picnic lunch. The Bridgewater Community House hosted community lunch today, as it does every Wednesday, with a very tasty sounding menu of patties with gravy and herb potatoes on offer. I must give a shout-out to the excellent view of Vinnies which also provides volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been lucky enough a few times to have a meal prepared by the volunteers at both the Bridgewater and Gagebrook community houses. They have been delicious every time. I've had a hand in preparing a few myself. I know for a fact that the member for Sydney is quite partial to the strawberry jam prepared by the volunteer cooks in the fast-foodies program at Gagebrook Community House. In the north of the electorate, Debbie and the team at Deloraine House, which hosted last year's state conference, have been hard at work at their new satellite site at Meander House, which will allow them to expand their services and programs across the beautiful

        </a>
        . I also have a visit coming up to the Derwent Valley Community House, where I am looking forward to giving a donation to coordinators Dianne and Lexia to support their upcoming Halloween disco.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very excited to see wood fired pizza making coming up this Friday at Midway Point Neighbourhood House. Unfortunately—disgracefully!—this event is for ages 15 to 25, meaning I'm just slightly outside of the age bracket, although Joe and the team have very kindly extended me an invitation. Further south, manager Matt and staff and volunteers at Okines Neighbourhood House have a fantastic school holiday program coming up, including making your own pizza, bike maintenance, scarecrow making, tote bag sewing, and workshops. Likewise, Dunalley Tasman Neighbourhood House, with Jeddah, are holding a school holiday drop-in session including games, movies and lunch.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's just a snapshot of the work that neighbourhood houses do across Lyons. Just as importantly, they have a big food-delivery service. They are a hub for providing meals to people who are doing it tough. Perhaps one of the saddest things about the last few years has been seeing how that service has grown and grown. Here's hoping that that service will reduce. To all the neighbourhood houses across Lyons and Tasmania: I wish you all the best, thank you all for your great service to the people of Tasmania and look forward to seeing you next year.
