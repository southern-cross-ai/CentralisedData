       <p>
        I too feel very comfortable in this committee room when you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, to support the member for Lyons and his compliments to you as well. I also understand your affection for the great game of the

        . We just heard the member for Cowan talk about his visit to the Kingsway Junior Football Club. In my role as the director of junior development at the

        in the Western Australian Football League I spent some time with junior clubs in my district on the weekend because their registration day was yesterday.

       <p>
        I just want to quickly mention the junior clubs in my district, which are: Manning, Redcliffe, Lynwood/Ferndale,

        , Thornlie, Maddington, Gosnells, Huntingdale and Kenwick. They are a great group and fine teams in my electorate and also within the Perth district. I would also like to congratulate them all and wish them all the best for the coming season. To all the umpires, officials, volunteers, parents and families who get involved with the junior sporting days, without their involvement there would be no competition, and the work that they do in the community is undervalued sometimes. I forgot to mention the coaches as well. They set the standards for the kids to play to, the standards of the games and the standards of the parents. I think that the work they do for the community is fantastic.
