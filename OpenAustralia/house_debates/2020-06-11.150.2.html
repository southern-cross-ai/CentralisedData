       <p>
        Australian honours to be celebrated by members of community are something that this House often takes note of, and I am pleased to pay tribute today to Brother Nicholas Harsas, who was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        on the weekend. Brother Nicholas was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for service to education and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Church
        </a>
        of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brother Nicholas is a very well known figure in the Fairfield community. He was the longest-serving principal of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady
        </a>
        of the Rosary primary school, which has existed for 90 years. He is much loved by the many people whom he educated. He is a Patrician Brother, and of course the Patrician brothers are a very important part of the Fairfield community, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrician_Brothers'_College" rel="nofollow">
         Patrician Brothers' College
        </a>
        being the high school in Fairfield. The fact he was the longest-serving principal of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_the_Rosary" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady of the Rosary
        </a>
        over its 90-year history is, I think, a sign of his dedication to the community. It's not only the length of his service that should be acknowledged but it's the difference he has made. To know Brother Nicholas is to like him. To know Brother Nicholas is to be touched by his dedication and his commitment to those whom he sought to educate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to note his commitment to educating newly arrived refugees in this country. My community, Fairfield, is the recipient of more refugees than any other community in the country. That's what we do every day—we live it every single day, welcoming, in more normal circumstances than we're seeing at the moment, refugees from Syria and other war-torn communities. And, of course that requires a level of commitment, including educating people, including young people who often have never attended a day of school in their life because their schools have been bombed or destroyed. They come to Australia, they come to Fairfield and we accommodate them in our schools, including our Catholic schools, Our Lady of the Rosary school. And Brother Nicholas was dedicated to doing that and ensuring a world-class education for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        His love of education is also exhibited by the fact that he obtained a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Master of Education
        </a>
        degree 20 years after he began as a teacher. That was his level of dedication to lifelong learning. And he, last year, celebrated his silver jubilee as a Patrician Brother, and today he serves on the Patrician Brothers' Congregation Leadership Team, the worldwide leadership team of the Brothers of St Patrick. Speaking last year on his 30 years of service to Catholic education Brother Nicolas said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A joy for me over the years is the connections I have made with students and their families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This has been one of the greatest blessings for me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brother Nicholas left Our Lady of the Rosary school recently, in 2018, which was of great sadness to us. But he did go on to become the principal of Holy Spirit Catholic Primary School in Carnes Hill in the neighbouring electorate of Werriwa, which I know the member for Werriwa celebrates. I was pleased to be one of his nominators for the Order of Australia, and I celebrate it in the parliament today.
