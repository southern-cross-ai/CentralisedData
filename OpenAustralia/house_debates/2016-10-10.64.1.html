        My question is to the Prime Minister. On Friday, more than 600 people lost their jobs in the Victorian automotive industry. I note the Prime Minister had nothing to say about these jobs, even though his predecessor, the member for Warringah, did tweet his sympathies. Why did the Prime Minister spent last week fighting for the jobs of bank

        </a>
        s and not of thousands of automotive manufacturing workers? And, Prime Minister, what is the plan to help these automotive workers find new jobs?

        <p>
         Friday was a very sad day for the workers of Ford and the communities of Geelong and Broadmeadows; they have been the home of auto manufacturing in Victoria for many years. It is important for honourable members to remember, particularly those opposite, that Ford's decision to stop local production was made more than three years ago under the Gillard Labor government. It was made despite Ford accessing $300 million of taxpayer funding under the Automotive Transformation Scheme between 2011 and 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
         My government is keenly focused on helping workers who have lost their jobs into new jobs and supporting firms in the supply chain to diversify their operations and access new export opportunities. We have established a $155 million growth fund to deliver on these objectives and work closely with Australian manufacturers as we do.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are backing local manufacturing, and we are beginning to see a world-class advanced manufacturing sector emerge. The honourable members opposite may have visited—as I have, with the member for Corangamite—Carbon Revolution in Geelong. That is the leader in its field in making carbon wheel rims—the leader in its field; the global best. That is an example of advanced manufacturing in Australia. Trajan Scientific in Ringwood—to give another Victorian example—is another. And it is important to remember, when we reflect on the politics of this, that the future of manufacturing in Australia must be advanced manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let us take this comparison: how many Australian ships—naval vessels—did the Labor Party commission during its six years? None—not one! Only the coalition has a comprehensive plan for naval shipbuilding and the advanced manufacturing jobs that come with it: 54 vessels. Our commitments—long overdue commitments in an area of responsibility neglected by Labor—will deliver thousands of advanced manufacturing jobs and deliver unprecedented spillover benefits in technology right across the economy. So we are transitioning our economy. We are moving on it. We are providing new opportunities, whereas the Labor Party—
