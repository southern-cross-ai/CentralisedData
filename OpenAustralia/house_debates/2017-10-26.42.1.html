       <p>
        In August I had the pleasure to attend the launch of the Smarter About Drugs program by Australia21 at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_the_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Star of the Sea
        </a>
        College in the wonderful electorate of Goldstein. The program is designed as a resource to help educators facilitate critical and informed discussions among students about drug and alcohol issuesâ€”something I'm sure is dear to everybody's heart. Australia21 is, of course, a leading voice in the conversation about how Australia can respond to drugs more effectively and safely. Crucially, they are also giving young people a voice on policy issues that are important to their future. That's why I was so pleased to attend the launch of their event at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_the_Sea_College" rel="nofollow">
         Star of the Sea College
        </a>
        in Brighton, which was attended by the principal of Star of the Sea, Ms Mary O'Connor. I'd also like to congratulate the politics teacher, Peter Farrar, for his contribution in bringing Australia21 and the students together as part of the conversation about being smarter about drugs.
       </p>

        I'd also like to acknowledge Rebecca Bunn, the chair of YoungA21; Yvonne Bonomo, the director of addiction medicine at

        from Harm Reduction Australia; and Carl von Stein, the deputy chair of the Drug Awareness Foundation. They came together to have a conversation about drugs, to help young people understand the risks and how they can be properly addressed. Together they are doing phenomenal work to protect young Australians from substance abuse.
