       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the electorate of Wright, to acknowledge the outstanding work done by the coalition leadership team, led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        : a man you can trust, a man of vision, a man of integrity and a man of sincerity. He is a leader who offers hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians. He is a man who can unite this nation by stopping the class warfare caused by the cheap politics of this government, whose handouts given to a select few are designed to turn neighbour against neighbour, Australian against Australian. Tony Abbott is a man you can trust, and he is a man you can trust to unite this country and to restore confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of the coalition team, my job will be to represent the mums and dads, the businesses, the pensioners and the people of Wright. I will stand with this team to return this nation to its former glory, to stop the waste and to stop the mismanagement, because this government is addicted to spending. Guess who is going to have to pay it back? The people of my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, Tony Abbott and the coalition are the team you can trust. We are going to the next election. I want you to remember the infamous words that will haunt this government. Four days before the last election, the Prime Minister said that there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Say one thing, do another. Trust Tony Abbott and the coalition team. We will rescind this carbon tax and we will put a stop to the waste and mismanagement. We will also stop the boats.
