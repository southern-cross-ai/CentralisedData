        This weekend I went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        with my kids. In one exhibition, visitors can share their thoughts and reflections on democracy, and a small green post-it note caught my eye. It was a message from Ash, a 16-year-old. They wrote: 'Politicians should be aware of how they communicate with each another. You're representing Australia! You're also role modelling to younger Australians!' Those last two sentences carried exclamation points to emphasise Ash's passion, and the words struck a chord with me at the end of a very difficult week. Every workplace in Australia should be a safe workplace for women. We know parliament is not safe; nor are many workplaces around the country. Last week was a reminder of the challenges, the risks and the violence that so many women face in the community and that this is still present in this place, despite the change of government last year. But at the end of a difficult and distressing week for many, it's also worth reflecting on the amazing people who are working on reducing sexual violence both here and around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I'd like to pay tribute to With You We Can. This is a national online resource, demystifying the police and legal systems for victims of sexual violence while still working to improve those systems. We know how hard it is for women to come forward after having experienced sexual violence. This website makes it easier. I want to honour Sarah Rosenberg, one of the its founders, who has turned her own lived experience into help for others. For those who've experienced sexual violence or are supporting others, there are resources there to make that difficult job easier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, I want to acknowledge the people who are doing amazing work in increasing the representation of women in the corridors of power, both here and around the country, because that is also critical to changing the culture of sexual violence in this country. Last week the Parliamentary Friends of Women for Election met, and the group heard from Licia Heath, who runs the non-partisan Women for Election Australia, which seeks to achieve gender parity in Australian parliaments. Licia reminded us that we still have some way to go, with women making up only 37 per cent of state and territory parliamentarians, but she also acknowledged how far this parliament, in particular, has come, with women making up 46 per cent of Commonwealth parliamentarians. That is an increase of almost 10 per cent in just one electionâ€”from 36 per cent to 46 per cent. It is huge growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we want to change the culture of this place and of the country, we need to elect more women across the board. I have the honour of sitting on the crossbench, which is a hive of strong, capable women standing up for the community and shifting the balance of parliament to be more representative of this country. In a week that was genuinely tough, this realisation gives me comfort and strength. While we still face challenges, we are making progress and we will continue to make progress. With the wonderful work of organisations like the ones I've just mentioned, we can make this country better than it already is.
