        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to my previous question. I asked not 'how' the Prime Minister was replaced but 'why'.

         The party chooses the person they want to lead to ensure that we can put the best foot forward at the next election and to ensure that we are connecting with Australians all around the country. Last week I went to Albury and I explained that our government has been incredibly successful in delivering, whether it's on jobs, the economy, getting rid of the carbon tax or ensuring we're delivering the nation-building infrastructure and the congestion-busting infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a government that has been strong on the 'what', but when it comes to the 'why', I'll tell you why this government is doing all these things. We believe in a fair go for those who have a go. We believe in a social safety net which says Australians back their mates. We believe in a country where people come to make a contribution, not to take one. We believe the best form of welfare is a job. We believe that one Australian to get ahead doesn't have to bring another one down. That's what we know. The Leader of the Opposition has a negative plan for Australia. He has no plan to ensure a strong economy. If he can't guarantee a strong economy, everything he says and every promise he makes is not believable, because he can't pay for it and he doesn't believe in the things that underpin any of the promises he makes.
