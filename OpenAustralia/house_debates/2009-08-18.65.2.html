        My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to recent media reports concerning new taxes on the family home. Will the Treasurer confirm whether he, his office or his department has sought or received advice on the introduction of any new tax, including, but not limited to, a capital gains tax on the family home?

         Here we go—another desperate smear-and-fear campaign from those opposite. I am happy to answer it, but be under no doubt what this is all about: those opposite are so embarrassed that they voted against a successful stimulus that here we go with another fear campaign.

            What we have through the Henry review is another fear campaign from those opposite, because they are so bereft of any policy all they can do is run a fear campaign. As the Prime Minister said in this House yesterday, we take the issue of tax reform very seriously, and that is why we established the Henry review. We do want to simplify the tax system. We do want to put more incentive in the tax system. We do want to make our tax system internationally competitive. There was some publicity on the weekend: an article on the front page of a paper, which suggested there had been some discussion with the government about capital gains tax or taxes on housing. There will be plenty of this drivel and misrepresentation around as we go through the Henry review, because those opposite will stop at nothing to mount a fear campaign to camouflage the fact that they do not have an alternative fiscal policy—no alternative fiscal policy whatsoever. But insofar as those press reports on Saturday said there would be any complication with the government—

               The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. To the extent that I added to the confusion there, I was trying to get the Treasurer to resume his seat, because the Leader of the Opposition had risen. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition then sat down, I think, is neither here nor there. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.

So what we have here is another fear campaign from a group of people who basically could not support this country in its hour of need. When it needed an economic stimulus they got up and said that it would not work. They said the stimulus would not work. The Leader of the Opposition went to the

                             What those opposite have proven time and time again is that, whether it is with economic stimulus or whether it is with the bank guarantee, they are the masters of misjudgment. The ultimate evidence of that is that there is not one skerrick of a fiscal policy they can put forward in this House. The facts of the matter are these. The stimulus has worked, but there are big challenges ahead for this nation. What the nation requires is unity in this House in dealing with those challenges, not the bitter division that we have seen from those opposite, not the fear-and-smear campaigns, not what they did in this House some weeks ago, where for a whole week of the parliament they could not ask me one single question about the economy. Indeed, in something like eight question times there has not been a question to the Treasurer about the economy. I have concluded.
