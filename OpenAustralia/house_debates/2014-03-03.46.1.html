        I take this opportunity to recognise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Amanda Young
        </a>
        Foundation and the important work being undertaken by this organisation in the fight against the deadly meningococcal disease, particularly in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . The foundation was formed in 1998 by parents Barry and Lorraine Young following the tragic death of their daughter, Amanda, who contracted the disease after a rowing event in 1997 at the age of 18. Last Wednesday I had the pleasure of meeting Barry and Lorraine at the Meningococcal Australia breakfast held here at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Meningococcal disease is an extremely deadly and contagious disease caused by bacteria which develops in the throat and nose and can be easily spread by activities such as sneezing, coughing, and sharing food or drink. The Amanda Young Foundation is a non-profit community organisation dedicated to reducing deaths in WA while also supporting survivors of the disease. The foundation is also committed to supporting the development of young people into WA's future leaders. The foundation organises an annual camp for year 11 school students across the state to support and encourage the development of leadership skills as well as numerous awards to high school and university students. The foundation hosts a number of fundraising events, including an annual ball, which this year will be held on 17 May. These events fund the foundation's work, including awareness raising about meningococcal disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us remember Amanda Young and all those who have lost their lives to this terrible disease. Let us also remember the critical role the Commonwealth has in investing in disease prevention and treatment.
