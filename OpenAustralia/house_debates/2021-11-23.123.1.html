        In my electorate of Longman we have one of largest veteran communities in Queensland. I've had the pleasure of speaking to many of these veterans and their families, whether it be at the veterans' forums I've hosted, out and about at community events, at Vietnam veterans' days, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        or Anzac Day services, or just helping them with their inquiries from my office. I would like to take a moment to thank them all for their service. We can never underestimate the importance of ensuring that our veterans have the support and services they need to live and work comfortably in our communitiesâ€”after all, they have fought for us and the country they love. It's now our turn to return the favour. That's why I've been fighting for funding for a veterans' wellbeing centre to be based in the heart of Longman. This would mean our veterans, their families and current ADF members who have begun the transition into civilian life are supported and have greater access to wellbeing services and support in the Longman community.

        I was fortunate to recently visit The Oasis Townsville with my colleague the member for Herbert,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Thompson" rel="nofollow">

        . They provide a single front door for all members of the ex-

        community, current members and their families. This is what I want for our veterans living in Longman. I want Longman's veteran wellbeing centre to provide simple access to local services specifically designed to meet the needs of our veterans. We want to help connect veterans and their families to a range of core services, including support for transition, employment, health and social connection and advocacy through the centre. I don't want our veterans to ever feel alone or feel that there is no help in sight, because you can count on me to fight for you.

        The federal government has made addressing the development and management of mental disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders for the veteran community a high priority. The mental health needs of veterans are diverse and rapidly changing, and veterans generally experience
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        at higher rates than the general population. That is why wellbeing centres for our veterans are vital in helping them to manage disorders or traumatic experiences. As part of our commitment to veterans across Australia, the federal government has announced further funding in the 2021-22 federal budget to expand the veteran wellbeing centre network to Tasmania and South-East Queensland, with $5 million in funding being allocated to each of these locations. This is great news for many of our veterans and their families. I want Longman to lead the expansion of the veteran wellbeing centre network in Queensland so that we can support the large veteran community in Longman. It is my hope that we can find a way to build this facility in Longman to service the needs of our substantial community of veterans.
