        I rise to congratulate Mr John Dunnet
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who was recognised as part of the King's Birthday 2023 Honours List, being awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . This award was fitting recognition for his many years of service to the print media industry. John has had a long and distinguished career. He was a co-proprietor and managing director of the
        <i>
         Courier
        </i>
        Narrabri from 1972 to 2007. He also served as a board member of the regional newspapers national industry body, Country Press Australia, from 1986 to 1997 and served as the president from 1995 to 1997. He was the Country Press New South Wales president from 1986 to 1999, before being made a life member in recognition of his many years on the state board. John additionally served as an industry delegate to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Press_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Press Council
        </a>
        for 18 years, from 1997. John's priority was always to ensure that the practice of journalism in our regions is delivered by newspaper women and men who are determined to uphold the traditions of accountability and responsibility. Our local newspapers are so important in small regional communities. The information they provide and the stories that they share are valuable to everyone who reads the paper. Congratulations, John, on being awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia and thank you for your lifetime of service to keeping your community informed and up to date on everything that is important.
