        Today, 26 February, is the anniversary of the birth of one of my more famous former constituents—in fact, he was never a constituent of mine, personally—Mr

         Lionel Logue

        . His grandfather is also very famous in my electorate for having established the Kent Town Brewery.

       <p>
        Mr Logue travelled to Perth, after completing his studies at Adelaide university's music school, and then became a self-taught speech pathologist. He was not welcomed by the establishment, particularly in the United Kingdom, but he perfected his techniques by assisting
