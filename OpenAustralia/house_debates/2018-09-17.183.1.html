        On Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the inaugural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dandalup" rel="nofollow">
         North Dandalup
        </a>
        Family Fun Day. With just over 700 residents, including 195 families, North Dandalup is one of the smaller communities in my electorate of Canning. But, despite its size, North Dandalup is a thriving community. Saturday's family fun day was well attended by people from all throughout the Peel region. It was great to see a variety of stalls set up on the oval for the day, including arts and crafts, local produce, business services and plenty of kids entertainment.
       </p>

        Highlights included the North Dandalup Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade, who performed firefighting demonstrations for the crowds of children. Special mention also goes to the firefighters for putting their truck on display, and my son Jonathan spent most of the day inside the truck. Mandurah Wildlife Rescue had a joey and a possum with them to help raise awareness about the importance of caring for our wildlife. The members of NuLook Health &amp; Fitness, a local gym, displayed their endurance during gruelling workouts throughout the day. And there was the

        O'Connor Foundation, which recently received $2Â½ million under the Building Better Regions Fund to develop Peel's first Centre for Innovation in Agriculture, in North Dandalup.
       </p>

        Special thanks go to the North Dandalup Community Group and in particular Sheree Chapman for bringing the community together for a great day out. Thanks also to the

        </a>
        for supporting the event and to all the stallholders who came from surrounding towns to support the people of North Dandalup. North Dandalup has a lot to be proud of, and it was great to see community pride on display on Saturday. I look forward to attending next year's North Dandalup Family Fun Day.
