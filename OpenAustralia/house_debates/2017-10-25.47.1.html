        The Pittsworth Craft and Fine Food Spectacular and spring garden week has been held successfully in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        for a number of years; this year commencing on 29 September. It's a combination of the spring art competition, spring gardening competition and the local quilters exhibition, amongst many other community activities. Funds raised maintain St Andrew's Anglican Church, which has some of the most renowned stained glass windows in Australia. It's quickly become one of the best craft and food fairs in our region and further afield, achieved by inviting the best craftspeople and artisans to exhibit their produce and their products.

        My wife, Anita, and I were pleased again to attend the Pittsworth art group's 17th spring art exhibition at the Pittsworth Art Gallery, opened by Allan Bruce, President of the Toowoomba Art Society. This event celebrates the commencement of the fine food and craft spectacular and the spring garden week. Anita and I have attended for many years, and it's always good to catch up with great friends such as Lyndal Madden, a former councillor, and her sister, Ros Scotney, a former mayor of Pittsworth. This year we came away with a delightful Pittsworth landscape piece by renowned local artist Mrs Krieg and a woodwork piece in the form of a multitimbered rolling pin.
