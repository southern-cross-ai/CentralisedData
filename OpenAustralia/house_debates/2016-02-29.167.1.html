       <p>
        Colleagues, today I would like to talk to you about the Yea Toil Art Stronger Communities round 1 project. It is based in the town of Yea, in my electorate of Indi, and it is flush with federal funding for a project to improve access to this popular amenity block in the town. So congratulations to the Yea community on receiving just over $18,000 under round 1 of the federal government's Stronger Communities Program. This funding will go towards the Yea Toil Art refurbishment project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Murrindindi Shire Council is providing $35,000 towards the project. So thanks particularly to the Murrindindi Shire Council's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Margaret Abbey, and Manager, Community Services, Naomi McNamara, for their efforts in the process to help me determine round 1 projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some years ago the Yea community created a mural on the outside of the central toilet block for the Toil Art initiative. These toilets have become a landmark facility. However, the disability toilets are only accessible by women, as the entry is through the female toilets. This access issue was highlighted as a priority by the Murrindindi access and inclusion advisory group. Thanks to them for all their work. And now, thanks to the Stronger Communities program funding, this issue will be resolved. So locals with mobility issues will be able to get out and connect with their community, and more tourists will be able to stop and use the toilets and visit local shops to boost the Yea economy. Thank you, everybody.
       </p>
