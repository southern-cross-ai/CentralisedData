        I was delighted to once again present the Ryan Community Service Awards as a way of recognising and celebrating the tireless work of individuals and groups in the community. Narelle Bird is an active member of Hilder Road State School's P&amp;C. Narelle currently chairs the fundraising subcommittee where she enthusiastically initiates fundraising activities including a cross-country caf√© and a school spellathon. Alistair Camm is another committed volunteer of Hilder Road State School and has been President of the school's P&amp;C since 2010. During his time in the position he has effectively steered the committee through a period of rapid growth and four changes of principals. Also at Hilder Road State School is parent and community volunteer Jason Raftopoulos. For several years Jason has devoted his time, expertise and resources in establishing a quality sound system to enhance the school's concerts.

        Over at Payne Road State School, Jenny Tucker has shown an outstanding level of commitment to the school's P&amp;C with many hours of work put in to projects to ensure they are always successful and improve the children's experience at the school. Jenny has taken on leadership of a number of major projects in the school, including work on the new tuckshop, improving the environment club area and road access to the hall. Jenny was also named Queensland Tuckshop Volunteer of the year in 2012. Thank you to all the recipients.
