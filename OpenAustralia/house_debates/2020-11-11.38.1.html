       <p>
        This morning I had the great privilege of attending the memorial service for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        . I congratulate all of those that had anything to do with organising or performing on the day. It was a very memorable service, indeed, and in great taste. Each time I go to Anzac Day, Remembrance Day or Vietnam Veterans' Day and we call through those numbers of people who went to fight for this nation, for our values—the numbers of those who were maimed, who were casualties; and then the numbers of those who forfeited their lives at these battles—it is a time for great reflection, and we should pause to remember this day and those other days every year. But, while I contemplate that, I also contemplate those that are serving the nation today. Last night, I had the opportunity to sit down and share a meal with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The conversation turned to Remembrance Day and what we owe those veterans that are coming back today and how in the past perhaps we haven't done as well—in fact, I'm sure we haven't done as well as we should have. He is determined to reach out to everyone, to find them all, to find everyone we can and keep them in our sights for the rest of their time. This afternoon, I will meet with him over a family that lost a son after eight years—returned from Afghanistan and gave up the fight earlier this year.
