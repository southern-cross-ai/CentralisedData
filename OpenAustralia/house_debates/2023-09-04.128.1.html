       <p>
        The health of our society can be determined by how we treat our youngest and oldest Australians. After decades of the coalition's neglect of our aged-care and childcare sectors, the workers I've interacted with in these sectors during my recent visits have found the environment of reform refreshing.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that I've heard most often during my aged-care visits is that aged-care workers are now feeling more valued and respected. They feel like they have a voice and that their concerns are being heard. Many observed that the government's decision to increase the pay of aged-care workers by 15 per cent did not only mean monetary reward for their hard work it was also an affirmation by the government that they and their work mattered. Delivering the largest wage rise in a long time showed that this government was serious about rectifying the unjust treatment towards them in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wage rise of 15 per cent is a significant investment in the aged-care sector, and it will make a real difference to the lives of aged-care workers who are selflessly engaged in looking after our older Australians. This air of positivity extends to aged-care residents who told me they are seeing a significant difference in the quality of care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aged-care reforms, based on the recommendations of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Aged Care Quality and Safety, introduced by the Albanese Labor government, are in the process of fixing systematic failure in the aged-care system. Mandating that at least one registered nurse is on site and on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week at every residential facility brought relief to many older Australians who weren't receiving the timely care they needed due to the lack of nurses.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also pleased with the government's commitment to investing in training and development for aged-care workers. The royal commission found that there was a shortage of qualified aged-care workers. The Albanese Labor government's reform to improve the training and education of aged-care workers will help to ensure that the sector has the skilled workforce it needs to provide quality care. I am committed to continuing to work with the aged-care sector to make sure that we continue our progress. I know that there is still more work to be done, but I am confident that we are on the right track.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, I've been very impressed with the positive conversations I have had with parents about the changes introduced by the Albanese Labor government to the childcare sector. The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Act 2022 meant 1Â¼ million Australian families benefited from cheaper childcare costs, which kicked in on 1 July this year. This meant child care was more affordable for families, with the greatest benefit being for those on low and middle incomes, which make up the bulk of my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several mums of Holt also spoke to me about how these changes encouraged them to return to work, giving them a refreshing sense of confidence and purpose. Like this government's work in the aged-care sector, cheaper child care is a major step forward in making child care more affordable and accessible for all Australian families. I am pleased to let them know that these changes will be supported by a suite of reforms that will be introduced upon the conclusion of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into Australia's early childhood education and care system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ensuring a strong and robust care economy has been at the front and centre of the Albanese Labor government's priorities since the very beginning. I am pleased the reforms introduced by this government are demonstrating results to the hardworking families in Holt, and I thank the House.
