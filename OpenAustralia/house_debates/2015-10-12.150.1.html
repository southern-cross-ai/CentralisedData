        I had the privilege and pleasure of attending the unveiling of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        honour board at

         Valley Heights
        </a>
        Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum last week. The honour board will be a permanent tribute to the railwaymen from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        who enlisted to serve during World War I. With a steady stream of visitors during the weekends the heritage museum is open, the honour board is a reminder to both the local community and tourists of the day-to-day lives that our servicemen and women had before they responded willingly to the call for war.
       </p>

        Those names on the beautifully crafted board were honourable men who left their families to serve their country. They deserve recognition, and it was wonderful to see this come to fruition through the Australian Government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. A grant of $2,132 was given to the Blue Mountains division of Transport Heritage
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        for the project. The honour board includes the names of the 18 known railway employees from the Springwood district who served during World War I. The names listed were based on the information contained in a book. It is called
        <i>
         Remembrance: Springwood District Honor Roll 1914â€“1919
        </i>
        , and was written by Blue Mountains locals Shirley Evans and Pamela Smith. The book took some five years to complete, and I congratulate Shirley and Pamela on their achievement and for bringing this history to light.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the 18 names listed, the first was Private Charles Percy Aldred. Charles, known as Percy to his friends, was born in London and came to Australia in 1913, where he worked for the railway at Valley Heights. He was an engine cleaner. Charles began as a private in the 18th Infantry Battalion 11th Reinforcement and, on 9 April 1916, embarked at Sydney on HMAT
        <i>
         Nestor
        </i>
        bound for Egypt. On 9 September, they left by sea to join the 18th Infantry Battalion. My grandfather also served in the 18th Infantry Battalion. In November, Charles became sick in the field and was admitted with trench foot to the First London General Hospital. Charles returned to France in early June, and he was promoted to lance corporal. While engaged in the battle in Poelcappelle in Belgium, Charles was hit by a machine gun or rifle bullet. He later died from his injuries. He was 22 years old. This, unfortunately, is not an uncommon story.

        I am grateful for the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The honour board was one of 14 projects across the Macquarie electorate. It was at the unveiling that I also had the opportunity to hear the touching and personal stories of many of the descendants of those listed on the board. I specifically acknowledge the family of Albert Honey and the family of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Brett" rel="nofollow">
         Thomas Brett
        </a>
        . I make special mention of museum chairman Bruce Coxon and publicity officer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Ward" rel="nofollow">
         Keith Ward
        </a>
        for their dedication to preserving such rich and important history and for applying for the grant. I also thank the volunteers and committee members for their ongoing commitment to the museum.
