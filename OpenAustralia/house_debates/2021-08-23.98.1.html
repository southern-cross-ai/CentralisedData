        I have question to you, Mr Speaker, and it goes to the functioning of the parliament and it goes further to a question that I previously raised referring to
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        , which says that ministers should be available during question time. I would ask you to consider that further and whether advice could be given to those ministers who we understand—there might be some reason why—can't attend.
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        , at page 549, is very clear:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … it has been traditionally expected that all Ministers who are Members of the House, unless sick, overseas or otherwise engaged on urgent public business, will be present at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time" rel="nofollow">
         Question Time
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Could I ask you to confirm whether it's possible if ministers attend virtual parliament—a large number of members of the Labor Party are actually doing their job and attending parliament—

           I can answer the question, which I think was right at the end. In terms of what I'm responsible for, and the Clerk and others, it's providing a video presence for members, who have been trained, from their electorate office, with a background that is as close to parliamentary as possible, and that is available. Certainly, without going through all of the agreement, it allows all members participating to speak in debates but not to move motions, and they can't vote, but it enables the asking of questions and it enables the answering of questions as well. So that's really my side of it. Did the Leader of the House want to enter the discussion?

           <p>
            Reluctantly, Mr Speaker. Just on indulgence, on the point made by the Leader of the Opposition, I would just direct you to page 263 of
            <i>
             Practice
            </i>
            which, under the heading 'Announcements of ministerial arrangements' says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Prime Minister from time to time informs the House of changes in the Ministry, of the absence or illness of Ministers, of any acting and representational arrangements that are made within the Ministry, and of changes—
           </p>
           <p>
            And it goes on. Mr Speaker, as has been the practice over the course of this unusual period with COVID, the reality is that the Prime Minister has made arrangements for ministers who are unable to be here to be represented by ministers who are. That is the practice that's been adhered to, and the line today from the Leader of the Opposition that somehow there's been a deviation from that doesn't represent fairly what has been the case since the start of this COVID period.

            <p>
             The only point I would make—as I said, it's not for me to ensure anyone attends, whether they're a minister or not—is, certainly, when ministers aren't here and someone's acting, it has been custom to explain the reason why they're not here, as in they're either overseas, which was more pre-COVID, or are giving a speech or are unable to be here for whatever other reason. So I just point that out.
