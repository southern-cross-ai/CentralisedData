        The student volunteer of the year award went to Aidan Morley, also of Woy Woy, who volunteers with HammondCare. Aged at just 15, he is caring for his community by supporting dementia patients and also by aiding the Red Shield Appeal, 40 Hour Famine and the Coast Shelter. Clint Pressley, of the
