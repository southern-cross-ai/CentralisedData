        My question is to the Prime Minister. More than a year ago, industry minister No. 6, out of the eight industry ministers of this government, announced that Australia would be producing its own mRNA vaccines by now. Since then there have been several announcements promising further announcements, and yet nothing has happened. Why not?

         The minister for industry may wish to add to the answer. We've been progressing strongly with the discussions we've been having with both

          CSL
         </a>
         and Moderna in relation to the manufacturing of mRNA vaccines here in Australia. This is not a capability that other countries have, other than those who had it prior to the commencement of this pandemic. We're looking forward to those negotiations now proceeding to the next level. I've been having constructive discussions with premiers about the support that they can provide also for this facility. This is an important capability in relation not just to COVID vaccines—with which Australia is well supplied, particularly in relation to booster shots—but to the role that mRNA vaccines can play into the future. The suggestion by those opposite that this is something that could already have been established here is simply false. We are progressing well with this initiative, working with those who have that capability, and we look forward to it being brought to Australia.

          I thank the Prime Minister for offering me the opportunity to add to his answer. Of course, an Australian manufacturer has already delivered 25 million vaccines, and there's potential to manufacture many more. This is all about making sure we have control over our own destiny, and that's why, on top of those 25 million vaccines that have been manufactured in this country, we're also developing a pathway to develop our own onshore manufacturing capability for mRNA. That has two core benefits. First of all, of course, it insures us against future pandemics and, indeed, variants such as we're seeing now. Also, it builds an industry capability and the jobs opportunity that comes with that. We know we are well positioned to build capacity in this very high-potential area of science. To get the best deal for Australia, we—

             <p>
              Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, we're taking a two-part approach. We're having discussions with Moderna, who manufacture one of only two approved mRNA products in the world. I've personally spoken with the head of Moderna in Australia and the chief executive globally. Secondly, we approached the market for proposals from industry and are asking what support they would need from government. We're working through that process thoroughly now.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is important for Australia, it's important for manufacturing and it's an important part of ensuring that we can control our own destiny. We're getting on with the job.
