        I rise today to acknowledge those who are being impacted on the frontline of the pandemicâ€”the healthcare workers, the aged-care workers, the teachers, the parents, the students and, of course, small business owners, who have shown resilience and persevered through this very, very difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to share some local examples of community service that I have witnessed across Reid, from Rhodes to Chiswick to Strathfield. Many people are doing it tough right now, but Reid has countless community groups who are providing access to food, clothing and essential items for those in need. I'd like to acknowledge St. Merkorious Charity in Rhodes, St Paul's Anglican church in Burwood, St Bede's Anglican church in Drummoyne and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathfield_Girls_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Strathfield Girls High School
        </a>
        , which has collected essential items and food to be distributed by the local meals-on-wheels service. Other groups have focused on maintaining social wellbeing, like the Drummoyne Community Centre, which has been delivering puzzles and activities for vulnerable residents in isolation. Then there are locals, like Phil Dye, who has been holding live concerts for residents in Chiswick to listen to from their balconies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The list goes on. These acts of service and kindness make me so proud to represent Reid. It is important to celebrate the best of the Australian spirit in times of adversity and acknowledge the good work being done in our community.
