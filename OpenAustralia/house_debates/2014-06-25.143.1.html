       <p>
        I would like to speak tonight about some major commitments the coalition government has made in this year's budget for my electorate of Bonner. It pleases me to say we have managed to fulfil our election promises to the people of Bonner and delivered funding for a number of key projects in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I am proud to say we have secured $100,000 for the Mount Gravatt Mens Shed. The coalition government is investing this money to help the men's shed build new facilities and upgrade its existing infrastructure. This is a big win for the Bonner communityâ€”in particular, for the men living in my electorate. Due to the outstanding work of the men's shed and its volunteers, the men of Bonner have the means to participate in and interact with their local community. I have been involved with the men's shed for some years now. Two years ago, I committed to securing this funding; so it is with great pride I make this announcement today. I have seen the men's shed member numbers grow to just over 275 as of this month. They are a great group of men who have dedicated much time and effort to support each other and those in the wider community. I am very pleased that the coalition government is able to provide these funds to help the men's shed continue to grow and I look forward to helping the Wynnum Mens Shed in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of those funds for the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed, the coalition government has also approved funding for several other key community projects. We will be investing $70,000 to install new

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">

        have been working tirelessly to improve safety throughout Bonner. I am pleased that the funds provided by the federal government will contribute to strong preventative measures that will make the Minnippi Parklands a safer and more family friendly environment. I would like to thank Councillor Ryan Murphy for his outstanding advocacy on this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also providing $26,000 to the Gumdale District Progress Association. This money will allow the Gumdale association to seal their car park at the Gumdale Progress Hall on New Cleveland Road in Gumdale. I would like to thank my state colleague the Assistant Minister for

        , Steve Minnikin, and Brisbane Deputy Mayor, Councillor Adrian Schrinner, as well as Councillor Murphy for supporting me on this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government is also providing a great deal of funding to go towards new recreation and sporting facilities in Mansfield. One of those facilities is the Mount Gravatt Sports and Recreation Club sports complex. I was very pleased to attend the opening of the sports complex earlier this year along with state minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Walker" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Councillor Krista Adams. The sports complex will greatly increase the number of sporting activities available to people in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also providing $59,400 to the St Paul's United Sporting Club for the first stage of construction of their Yandina Park clubhouse facility in Wishart. This will go towards change rooms, public amenities and a first aid and referees room for the new clubhouse. As part of the coalition government's

        and additional work to protect and enhance the Lindum Wetlands.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is always with the greatest pleasure that I announce funding for projects such as these in Bonner. I have been able to help a great number of people in my electorate in my time as the member and you could not meet a more friendly and hardworking group. I look forward to providing more assistance to the people of Bonner in the future and I thank them for their wonderful friendship and support throughout the years.
