        All of us in this place receive a lot of correspondence, much of which would be beneficial and some that is very compelling. Today, I want to read into the public record an email I received from Karen in Devonport. The email is entitled 'I am lucky'. I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky enough to be on a Disability Support Pension for 8 years because of a car accident and ongoing medical issues. I am told I could have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS" rel="nofollow">
         MS
        </a>
        but they are not sure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky to have a Doctor who understands the pain and restrictions I have, but I have to pay almost seventy dollars which I get back thirty six from Medicare but I have to have that seventy dollars in my bank to see my Doctor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My Specialist is in Hobart and bulk bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I travel from Devonport to Hobart twice a year to see him.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now this is not cheap, with the cost of fuel and a bite to eat I have to set aside at least one hundred and twenty dollars.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky enough to be able to get a travel allowance but after my specialist signs it—but then I have to go to my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        and get her to sign it…again this cost me thirty five dollars.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My travel allowance pays me one hundred and three dollars for each trip to Hobart. It makes it hard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky enough to get discounted medication, but my Ostemol has been removed from the PBS and instead of purchasing 3 packets for the cost of five dollars twenty I now pay four dollars ninety five per packet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky enough to live in a housing Department home.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been told I need to reduce the "luxuries" in my life. I have a mobile phone and internet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not much else.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I need internet to remain in contact with Government Departments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have pre paid power.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I purchase 25 to 30 dollars a fortnight but lately this runs out the day before pay day—so I go 10 hours without power.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am a very savy shopper for food but because of my medical condition I need to eat healthy, but to be honest, I cannot afford to.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To buy fruit, vegetables and healthy food it takes most of my food budget and leaves very little for meat.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Meat is a luxury.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky enough to own a little car. I am lucky enough to be able to pay twenty dollars a fortnight for fuel, which never seems to get me through the fortnight.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am lucky enough that the Government gives me a rise of two dollars, twice a year, but Housing takes one dollar of this as my rent is income based.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So now you know what I and others struggle with each fortnight. I just want you to understand what it is like.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to Karen and to all those in similar circumstances that the Labor side of this House understands these challenges and is the only party prepared to make life for people like Karen a little bit easier. For example, if the Prime Minister dropped his Medicare freeze, Karen's medical bills would stop increasing. Labor gets it, Karen, and thank you for having the courage to allow me to share your story.
