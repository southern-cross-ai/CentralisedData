        I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful community organisation that is existing and thriving in the centre of my electorate of Perth, and that is the good people of Inglewood on Beaufort. This community group really has gone from strength to strength, and it is a great and wonderful example of what happens when business operators and residents get together with the common goal of ensuring that their local community indeed thrives from a vibrant and beating community pulse.

        One need look no further than what occurred on the weekend, with the amazingly organised team of Inglewood on Beaufort getting together to completely reactivate a space which was otherwise the site of a demolished building. It was a construction site that had well and truly fallen into disrepair and, indeed, was starting to attract—and had attracted for some considerable period of time—antisocial behaviour. Through consultations with local council, the crew at Inglewood on Beaufort decided to pitch in with a busy bee, to make sure the area was clear of rubble and landfill and to completely reactivate the space. Not only would that include, in due course, lighting and a mural, by way of activation, but on the weekend all of the gang put their shoulders to the wheel and constructed, from nothing, these wonderful jarrah planter boxes, eight of them in total, that will also double as park benches, to be placed around the space, with lovely plane trees in the middle, creating, almost out of nothing, a wonderful environment that will attract families with kids to play and to just generally have a good time.

        Not only is this happening on a regular basis, but the troops at Inglewood on Beaufort also, every Monday night, absolutely ensure that the northern end of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Beaufort Street
        </a>
        comes alive with the Beaufort Street night markets. The night markets attract food trucks, stalls and all sorts of entertainment, and that draws families out in their thousands to enjoy a wonderful stretch of Beaufort Street that comes alive, where families can eat together, play together and thrive and prosper together.

        A special shout out to the amazing committee who do such wonderful hard work, often without any real form of recognition at all—to the amazing Vince Garreffa, the chair of this incredible group; Matt Seabrook; Tamara Radi; Father Stephen Conway, of

        , of course; Damien Giudici and Emma Oliver, and to all of the others who are doing such great work with Inglewood on Beaufort: more power to your arm. We could all take a leaf out of your book in terms of getting the job done and making sure families have a great time in Inglewood. Well done, Inglewood on Beaufort!
