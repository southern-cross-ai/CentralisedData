        How many children need to be killed in Gaza before this government withdraws its support for Israel's invasion? What is the number? Over 10,000 children killed is not enough for them to stop exporting weapons? There has been $1.5 million in just February this year in arms and ammunition to Israeli, according to the government's own data. What will it take for Australia to cancel its contract with

Asking Israel nicely is meaningless while Australia is still exporting weapons to Israel, refuses to sanction Netanyahu and his war cabinet and signs deals with companies who profit immensely from the murder they cause in Gaza.
