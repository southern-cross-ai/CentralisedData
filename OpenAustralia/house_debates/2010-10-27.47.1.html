        I would like to congratulate Professor Berni Einoder AM, who has been honoured with a rare life membership of the Australian Orthopaedic Association. He received his award at the association’s annual scientific meeting in Adelaide. This was most appropriate as Berni has edited the scientific journal of that organisation for many years. I first came across him when he was the club doctor at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Launceston_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         North Launceston Football Club
        </a>
        and later in the Sports Medicine Federation. I then worked for him for 17 years at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I know no fiercer fighter for health, for training, for education and for research. Berni has been an active member of the Orthopaedic Association since 1973 and, when you use the word ‘active’ about Berni Einoder, you mean superactive. Berni does not suffer fools lightly, but in my working life he was the most loyal boss you could wish for. Berni certainly lives by his three Ds and one P—determination, dedication, discipline and perseverance. Berni has been a farmer, a tree grower, a skier, a windsurfer, a bushwalker and, in his younger days, a footballer. In an interview after his appointment, his advice to young people was, ‘You have got 80 years on this earth if you are lucky, so don’t muck around because every minute counts.’ Congratulations to Professor Berni Einoder AM, life member of the Australian Orthopaedic Association.
