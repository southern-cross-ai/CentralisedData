        ) ( ): I rise to salute the organisers of the Springsure Doin' it for Dolly Charity Rodeo. The Doin' it for Dolly rodeo happened at Springsure last Saturday night. Springsure is a town 70 kilometres south of Emerald that is known for its cattle, coal, grain and chickpeas. The population is about 1,100. The crowd and competitors came from all over Australia. The Springsure Showgrounds turned a shade of blue, and over 5,000 spectators and 290 competitors took to their seats and their saddles. The event raised more than $100,000 for Dolly's Dream Foundation.
       </p>

        The event was organised by a Springsure couple. They didn't know Dolly, but they knew what it was for families to suffer such a blow. Shannon Bleakley and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Roberts" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        were the main organisers, but they had hundreds of community-minded volunteers and generous businesses, organisations and community groups who supported them. Shannon and Dan didn't know Dolly Everett or her family, but they knew that people would support the cause of Dolly's Dream Foundation. The Springsure event was significant given that Dolly's mother hailed from Springsure, and family members came from close-lying areas were there to witness the event.
