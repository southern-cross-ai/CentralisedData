        I raise this matter again because my constituents continue to be concerned about this. As I have said in the parliament before, it is easy to understand why this is a very considerable impediment to economic activity in the state of

        . It is a missing link. It is the one road that links Melbourne to Brisbane, and there is no alternative. It has a lot of suburban traffic mixed with heavy trucks that occasion very considerable risk to the community in my constituency. If you look at Sydney, with four major highways across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , when you come to the north-west, there is only one link. It is a considerable trail, which will mean that no effective funding will be provided by the bodies that advise on infrastructure funding because the preliminary work will not be done. Stripping away the funding was a considerable act of betrayal by this government, and it certainly demonstrates a lack of commitment to substantial infrastructure pending, which is of fundamental importance to the increased productivity that you might expect in Sydney. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I table the petitions, because they draw attention to this very important issue.
