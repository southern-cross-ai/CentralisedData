        On Saturday, 14 November I had the great privilege of launching the 2016 Reserve Forces Day and representing the Prime Minister as well. The Reserve Forces Day parade aims to raise awareness of the vital work of Army, Navy and

        current and former reservists and thank partners, families and employers for their support. The inaugural Reserve Forces Day, and the parades, began with my support when I served as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and I have continued to support it every year since. The event has grown significantly, with 15 cities throughout Australia conducting parades and celebrations in 2015.
