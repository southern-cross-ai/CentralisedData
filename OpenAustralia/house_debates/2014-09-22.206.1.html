       <p>
        Thursday last week was national HIPPY week. I attended the HIPPY celebrations at Windale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        . It was a very positive experience. I have gone along and visited the HIPPY program on a number of occasions. HIPPY stands for Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. It is about providing parents and children with an environment in which they can learn. It is about giving parents skills and the confidence they need to work with their young children in getting them ready for school. At Windale this program has been extremely successful. A number of the parents that have worked in a voluntary capacity at the group have gone on to find employment in that area. It is very seamless. It goes from the HIPPY program to the preschool program at the local school, and then from the local school's preschool program students are going to school itself. It is very strongly focused on the community. It is very strongly focused on providing skills and a supportive environment and enabling children to develop the techniques they need to learn once they attend school. I commend those people involved with the HIPPY program at Windale.
