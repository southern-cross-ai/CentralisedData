       <p>
        I rise to talk about the launch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        's Perth Hills trial site, where we were welcomed by Marita Walker, the trial site manager, and by Indigenous elder Sean Nannup. The launch was held at the newly constructed office in Midland. Around 80 people attended from local, state and Commonwealth governments. To start with, they will be working together to provide wrap-around services for those who require the support in the NDIS trial.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there were two young people who struck me in particular. One was Peter Darch, who gave a presentation. Peter will not be a participant in the trial site, but is a strong supporter of the NDIS and a participant in the Every Australian Counts campaign. Just over nine years ago, Peter was involved in an accident that left him paralysed. After being hospitalised, he completed his schooling and studied psychology at university. He now works as a youth development officer for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Mandurah" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter expressed his frustration with the old system in that it was geared around things going bad. He has had to fight for everything. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        No one looks at you and says youâ€™re on a pathway to independence we should support you 100%.
       </p>
       <p>
        He hopes that the NDIS will enable people with disability to lead independent and fulfilling lives, rather than blocking people. Leanne Bridges is a mother of a young girl with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Syndrome" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Leanne Bridges in a participant in the trial and is looking forward to the way that the NDIS trial will better provide a range of services for her daughter.
