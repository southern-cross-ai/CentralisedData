        Cable cars are a touchy subject in Tasmania. Long-stalled plans for a cable car up the side of kunanyi/

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Roland" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Roland
        </a>
        , about 300 kilometres north-west of Hobart. It's the brainchild of Justin Carman and of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Inder" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Inder
        </a>
        , who is famous in the north-west region for creating the amazing wonderland of Tasmazia and Lower Crackpot. Six years ago, Justin and Brian started work on their concept to run a cable car up Mount Roland, which is one of Tasmania's stunning mountains. The view of this mountain from the nearby town of Sheffield can be absolutely jaw-droppingly beautiful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Justin and Brian have done all the right things in terms of submissions and preapprovals, but they have become increasingly frustrated by the bureaucratic and political inertia within the state government. Briefly, in November 2014 they submitted an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOI" rel="nofollow">
         EOI
        </a>
        , only to learn in March 2015 that it had been rejected on the basis they needed to submit a feasibility study to prove the viability. They've done that. For three years they've gathered all the data, as well extending the project to incorporate mountain biking, which is taking off like a rocket in Tasmania. In May this year they resubmitted the proposal and, until yesterday, in fact, had heard nothing back, despite requests.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to report to the House that the state government has now asked to meet them to discuss the proposal further. I should stress, this is all simply about preapproval. It's taken four years to get to preapproval. If they get the nod they will then submit the proposal for a formal and rigorous planning approval process, which will include, of course, a formal round of community consultation. They're already listening to community feedback and have shifted the site of their proposed cable car so it can't be seen from Sheffield.
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't want to pre-empt the decision making process, but it's hard not to be enthusiastic about the possibilities this project could bring to the Kentish region. It will provide more than 30 direct jobs, extend tourism into winter, bring more visitors to the region and keep them in the area and give life to the idea of a Mount Roland adventure precinct, which could later include abseiling and similar pursuits. Justin and Brian have not asked for one cent from government, and they are confident they can fully fund this venture. The government has nothing to lose in allowing this project to proceed to the next stage. There will be a public meeting on this proposal at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Town_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Sheffield Town Hall
        </a>
        on Tuesday, 25 September. I urge all those in the Kentish region to turn up and learn more about this exciting proposal for the Kentish region and Mount Roland.
