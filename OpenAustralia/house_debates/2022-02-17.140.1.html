        Australia recognises our citizens for the hard work and contributions they make to develop and foster a prosperous, growing community for the betterment of all who call Australia home. Our honours and awards system recognises the merit of outstanding service and contributions of Australians. Recipients come from far and wide, right across our great nation, from all walks of life and from different circumstances to inspire and make positive change for future generations. While some are well known for their contributions, the majority are unsung heroes, who make an impact in their own communities, unobserved by the public eye but recognised by those who nominate them for their service and contribution to our great country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Typically our country's heroes don't seek thanks or applause. They deserve both. The honours and awards system gives the nation a chance to celebrate and acknowledge those who work tirelessly to improve local communities and to make Australia a better place. I congratulate and pay homage to the citizens of Moncrieff who this year received such an honour.
