        ( Â  I am pleased to report to the House that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Oliver" rel="nofollow">
         Jamie Oliver
        </a>
        will bring his fourth Australian Ministry of Food pop-up kitchen to southern Adelaide this year, which is a huge win for my local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate Colonnades Shopping Centre and the Onkaparinga Council, who partnered to host the kitchen. They were among eight finalists. I am pleased to have the member for Gellibrand in the chamber today, because there was fierce competition between his electorate and my electorate. Fortunately for me, and unfortunately for him, the better application won. Colonnades and the Onkaparinga Council put forward a compelling case to Jamie by offering a rent-free space, arguing the benefits that this kitchen would bring to our community.
       </p>

        initiative has the potential to improve the health and eating habits of many people in our community by empowering people with the skills and knowledge to change their eating and cooking behaviour. The five-week course is open to people who want to learn the basics of cooking. During the 90-minute classes, participants will learn to cook simple, healthy and tasty meals using fresh ingredients. I hope that organisers do look to our local produce, which is excellent, in the regional area. The course will also cover meal planning, budgeting, shopping tips and nutritional education. This really builds on great work done in this area by the Onkaparinga Community Foodies and the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program running in my schools, funded by Labor in the previous government. I congratulate everyone involved.
