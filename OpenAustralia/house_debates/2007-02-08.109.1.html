       <p>
        Today in this adjournment debate I would like to thank some community groups in my electorate of Casey and particularly make mention of some community leaders and some of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        activities. Like all of us, I attended a range of events on Australia Day. I started at the Wandin Town Hall for breakfast, which has become an annual event in the country town of Wandin in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley
        </a>
        . They fill the town hall every year to celebrate Australia Day, to reflect on our values and on our good fortune to be Australians and also to continue to raise money for the very good causes that Wandin Rotary is so committed to. I also attended some citizenship ceremonies—in Ringwood and in Lilydale. It is a wonderful thing at any time to see people taking the oath to become an Australian citizen, but it is particularly important for them on Australia Day. To see those new citizens there on Australia Day with their families is indeed a privilege and an honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was also good to see was the recognition by the local councils and the local community of community leaders and volunteers, which has become a fixture of Australia Day. At both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroondah_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Maroondah City Council
        </a>
        and at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Yarra_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Yarra Ranges
        </a>
        , community leaders in all categories were honoured for the work that they do. It brings home to you the number of people who will put in hours and hours for a community cause—be it with the environment or with homeless people. Whatever the cause, there are people who are prepared to devote time to help others, and to recognise them on Australia Day is a particularly good thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just want to make mention of some of the recipients of awards whom I have come to know and whose work I have come to see first hand. Firstly, in the Shire of Yarra Ranges, Christine Morgan was recognised as environmental achiever of the year. Christine and a dedicated group have worked very hard with practical environmental initiatives in their local street and local community in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandenong_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Dandenong Ranges
        </a>
        , where they have worked together in partnership to remove weeds and deal with some of the environmental problems. They have been the recipients of an Envirofund grant that has helped them. But, without the work of Christine in pulling everybody together and inspiring that community, little would have been achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to make mention of Mr Ray Yates. He is Principal of Monbulk Primary School, and he won the award for citizen of the year. His work has extended over 20 years, where he has served as a councillor and helped in a variety of causes. I thought it was just wonderful for him to be recognised. He particularly plays a big role now in the Monbulk community, with the primary school working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        on Anzac Day and on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to also mention two cricket clubs that played a charity match for two of the RSLs on the weekend after Australia Day—the Croydon North Cricket Club and the Kilsyth Cricket Club. I mentioned these two clubs last year, when they had their first match. Again, they had a wonderful 20/20 match where they got representatives from clubs in the region to play to raise money for the Lilydale RSL and for the Croydon RSL. It was a fantastic match—as I said, a 20/20 game. Croydon scored 212 runs, but the Lilydale RSL won in the last over with 214 runs. The man of the match was Chris Springett. He combined with Brendan Adams for a partnership of over 100 runs, representing the Lilydale RSL. So I pass on that to the House and commend those two clubs for putting in such a great effort for the RSLs.
