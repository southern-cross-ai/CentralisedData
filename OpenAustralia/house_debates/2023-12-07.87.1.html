       <p>
        I want to pay my respects to those who are mourning the loss of a well-known and much-loved former member of the press gallery, Bridget Munro, who passed away suddenly on 22 November.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bridget was universally liked and respected as a wonderful human being, with a smile that lit up every room. Bridget was a senior news producer with both Sky News and, later, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        , and I know that many members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Parliamentary_Press_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery
        </a>
        attended the funeral that was held just yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her sudden passing at such a young age has been felt heavily by her many friends in the gallery. Our thoughts are with her husband, Adrian, and their two little girls, Gracie and Margot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bridget was rightly proud of her accomplishments in her career. She loved what she did; but her greatest joy in life was her family, and we're all thinking of them at this very sad time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note, after more than 22 years with

        <i>

        </i>
        . Paul is, as always, watching question time from the press gallery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul started with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAP" rel="nofollow">
         AAP
        </a>
        in January 2001. His time covering the news has included more than a decade in Canberra where, most recently, he has managed the bureau. Paul is a highly respected journo—for his integrity, news sense and for calling it straight. In his job, he has to work fast, but his work is always fair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul is rightly admired by his colleagues as a tireless advocate for AAP—we well remember when its very existence was threatened—and for public interest journalism. As a mentor and a source of great advice, he's assisted many generations who've come through the gallery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations, Paul, I wish you all the very best with what's ahead.

        <p>
         I join with the Prime Minister in mourning the loss of a person way too young to leave this world, Bridget Munro, leaving behind her two little girls, Gracie and Margot, and her husband, Adrian. To all of her family members and friends, who will be mourning her loss, we send our sincere condolences, and also to those in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
          Press Club
         </a>
         who knew Bridget well and worked with her closely. They too, of course, have been shocked by her passing. It is a very sad moment that we mark but an important one, because we want to pay tribute to Bridget's work here in the building, as the Prime Minister pointed out, with Sky News and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
          SBS
         </a>
         . She was a very respected colleague of many within the press gallery, and we pass our condolences on to her family and friends at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
         On a brighter note, presumably, for Paul, in terms of his life—after 30 years, he's either a slow learner or other opportunities haven't come up—it's taken a 30-year sentence in this place for him to finally leave! Congratulations, Paul. There are some journalists who we would wish were leaving but who aren't, but you're not in that category, Paul. Paul is one of the gentlemen of the gallery. He's a person who is a true professional, and he is somebody who is respected by both sides of parliament. He is somebody who has contributed significantly to reporting on major events, as his
