        Last week I had the chance to catch up with some of the recipients of our Local Sporting Champions grants. Over afternoon tea, I was able to hear from these amazing young sports talents about their experiences, challenges and aspirations. Hannah Rutherford, at just 13 years of age, is part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        team for the National Water Polo Championships. Hannah trains at least twice a week in addition to swim training a few extra days every week. Josiah Goodwin, a year 10 student at Terrigal High School, is already competing in the national figure skating competition. For somebody who started only ice skating six years ago, Josiah is already an accomplished athlete. Six days a week he trains both on and off the ice, with the goal to one day represent Australia at the Olympics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matilda Ralph is also at home on the ice as part of the Southern Sky Synchronized skating team. I have to say that this is the first time I have ever heard about this sport, which Matilda described to me as a combination of dancing and synchronised swimming all on ice. As part of an 18-person ensemble, Matilda said that precision is key and that she's required to train five days a week for three hours at a time. She's got her sights set on competing at the 2020 world championships.

        Aimilee Stokes is a 13-year-old

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . Training around three times a week means that Aimilee spends most of her free time working to improve her riding ability and confidence. I have to admit that I don't think I could ever do what Aimilee does out on a BMX track. We're incredibly proud of her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next month Katie Newman will be participating in the 2018 Netball New South Wales State Age Championships as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        representative team. For Katie the dream is to one day play netball professionally, and she trains incredibly hard to make this a reality. Hannah Bolton last year won bronze in the Australian All Schools Championships in the race walk event as part of the New South Wales team. This is a highly technical sport that requires an enormous amount of skill and endurance. I really loved hearing all about it and Hannah's technique. She even gave us a quick lesson in race walking. Over afternoon tea, every one of these sporting champions was able to raise with me one issue that was most important to them, from access to sporting infrastructure to the cost of pursuing sport at an elite level. I look forward to raising their concerns with my colleagues over the next sitting week.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to pay tribute to a few sporting champions who couldn't join us on the day but who are also exceptional athletes. To Ashleigh Thacker, Daisy Duguid, Tara Mulcahy, Nathan Holt,

        , Callum Sutton and Asher Ryan: congratulations on your incredible achievements in your chosen sport. Pursuing sport like this requires enormous commitment. To the parents of our sporting champions: I acknowledge your dedication, your support and your tireless efforts. To our sporting champions: we are proud of everything you've already achieved.
