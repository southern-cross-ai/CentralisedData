        Established in 1883 and nestled in the beautiful Yarramalong Valley, Wyong Creek Public School is a reminder of a simpler time, before urban development to the east of the M1. Home to 54 students, the school provides a nurturing environment, with a strong sense of belonging and pride amongst its students.

        Upon my visit to Wyong Creek Public School I was greeted by the school's resident scarecrow, an entrant in this year's Yarramalong Valley Spring Festival. The scarecrow was designed and constructed by the students and positioned amongst a field of flowers bearing the faces of the students.

        The highlight of my visit was meeting the students who were about to embark on a visit to Canberra. As I walked into the classroom, they were engaged in a session of mock parliament and were preparing for their trip. The students posed questions ranging from which member of the mock parliament occupied my seat to how many pieces of legislation had been passed by this parliament. I was happy to advise them the number is 109. During my visit, I also presented a new Australian flag to the school as well as books from the Parliament Shop for the school library.

        I would like to thank principal

        and his wonderful team for welcoming me to their school and the students for their enthusiasm and their questions about federal parliament and Australia's system of government. I look forward to many more visits to Wyong Creek Public School and to hearing about the students' visit to

        , which I believe took place last weekâ€”but, as parliament was not sitting, I was not able to meet them here. It is a great school and I wish them all the very best.
