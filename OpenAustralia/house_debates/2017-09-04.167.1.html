        I rise in this place today to congratulate the Townsville Choral Society for an absolutely outstanding rendition of the production

        . The depth of talent in Townsville is simply amazing. Our young people are incredibly talented and hardworking. Courtney Dibben played a truly gregarious and enthralling Galinda, alongside a superb Elphaba, played by Nina Lippmann.

The singing was strong and sensational; the choreography was extraordinary; the live music was fabulous; the sets, costumes, make-up and hair design were sublime. The back-of-stage was very professional. Congratulations to everyone involved in the Townsville Choral Society for an outstanding and sold out production. This production was equally as good as the professional show that I saw in our state capital, Brisbane, and I say well done to the Townsville Choral Society.
