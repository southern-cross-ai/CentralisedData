        Today I join a global movement for girls' leadership. Across the world, more than a thousand girls and young women are being promoted to positions of power for a day. Here in Australia 17 young women are stepping into the shoes of members of parliament. The takeover was organised by

        report that was released today found that 0.3 per cent of young women—just one in 297—aspire to be politicians. This is truly unacceptable. Women need to be encouraged to go into politics and taught that they have a right to be in this place and on the front bench. Nearly half of the young women surveyed felt there were not enough opportunities for them to become politicians, and one in three young women felt that gender was a barrier to them. I encourage every member of this House to support young women's political aspirations and encourage their participation in democracy.
