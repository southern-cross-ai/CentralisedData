        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim that no member or members of the referendum working group ever suggested to him or his office that the referendum be delayed to a date later than 14 October?

          That hasn't been my claim. I was asked if anyone from the referendum working group ever said that to me, and I answered no. Just a short time ago, the higher education support amendment bill 2023 passed the Senate. That's a good thing. A short time ago, as well, in the other place, the coalition stood next to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson" rel="nofollow">
           Pauline Hanson
          </a>
          to vote against a measure that will help Indigenous kids go to uni. So not only are they not prepared to support a position that was put to the former government—not to us but to the former government—in 2017 for assistance to be given to the request for Indigenous recognition in our Constitution through a voice to parliament but, in spite of the appointment as the shadow minister for indigenous affairs and the shadow Attorney-General, the two portfolios that relate to this, of the member for Berowra—someone who had been engaged in this issue since as far back as at least 2012, a man of principle and someone who had been to places like Garma and sat down with

          I got asked a question the other day about truth in political advertising. I'll tell you what the biggest breach of political advertising in this country is. It's the word Liberal next to their name because they are a reactionary party who never know what they're for. Those opposite just stand for what they are against. There was once a time when people who called themselves moderates, in the case of the member for Bradfield, held two forums—one for the yes and one for the no—telling one group of people he was in favour of yes and another group of people he was in favour of no. That's what went on! That's the sort of conviction politics that we see from those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition.

          We're getting on with delivering practical differences, like in health: delivering dialysis units, increasing the number of Indigenous health workers and practitioners and delivering new and upgraded health clinics. In education, that legislation about opening up opportunities for Indigenous kids is one of the things that we're doing, as well as making early childhood education and care more accessible—
