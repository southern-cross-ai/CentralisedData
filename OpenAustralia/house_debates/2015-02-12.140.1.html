        I would like to put on record my admiration and thanks to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Engineers Australia
        </a>
        for the important work they do every day, but specifically in relation to participating in an up-coming nuclear power showcase, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , that I am hosting.
       </p>
       <p>
        On nuclear power I led the debate with a speech to parliament in March 2005. Nuclear power is cheap, clean, safe and sustainable. It would be churlish to say that there are not risks and challenges. The challenges are as real as the opportunities are great.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having led the charge on the nuclear issue in this place in the past, I know that support for nuclear is not limited by party ties. I ask all members and senators to take advantage of the upcoming nuclear power briefing luncheon that I am hosting. This, I hope, will be the little flick that sets in train the dominoes of inevitability. But, more than that, I hope that we can all approach the issue of nuclear power, and all its possible uses, with a fair and open mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are real fears in the community about nuclear power, but let this not rule or reduce the scope of our imagination or possibilities. In 2005 I tried to ignite a national conversation regarding the use of nuclear power for domestic applications. In latter times I have spoken extensively about the incomparable benefits of adopting and/or just allowing nuclear into the submarine choice mix. Post Collins class, we all need to look at performance and value for money, and an ability to protect Australia and our people. So, on whatever front one wishes to look, be it domestic energy generation, national defence, or even nuclear waste storage, having a mature, reasoned and real debate can only be in Australia's interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the royal commission in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        into nuclear. It is well known that former Prime Minister Hawke is a strong supporter of using our vast desert interior for nuclear waste storage. This type of bravery and imagination is what will get Australia firing again. Australia stands to gain from lower electricity costs, increased competitiveness, greater national security independence, and massive and sustainable employment for thousands. This new industry is so obvious, so possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        To those opposed to the proposed debate, I say that now is the time to stop stopping and start starting. A new perspective. A new opportunity. The first step is by attending the upcoming nuclear briefing luncheon I am hosting in the Senate alcove at 12:15 pm on 24 March.

        s can be sent to me directly, and my office team stands ready to lock in places. I encourage all members in this place and the other place to contact me on this important issue and upcoming event. George

        is often quoted for saying, 'I see things that never were and say, why not?' Today, the debate on nuclear is at the same turning point of history. The challenges of the future will only be greater. So I wish to thank Engineers Australia for your necessary bravery and imagination. On Tuesday, 24 March, get lunch, get the facts and get a new perspective. Today, it is time to move beyond the politics of fear—fear of the objection of the minority—and negativity, in the interests of the majority.
