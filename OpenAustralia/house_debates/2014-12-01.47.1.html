        Tomorrow, Senators Muir and Lundy, along with the hardworking and most effective member for Lindsay, will as co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Motoring be hosting a car show on the lawns of parliament. I congratulate those members and senators for their work in organising this event.

        I would also like to take the opportunity to remind the House that next year I will be once again hosting the Hughes Charity Car Show in my electorate. In our very first year, we had some 209 cars on display and we raised more than $5,000 for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        Rural Fire Service. In 2015, we will be taking advantage of the warmer weather in summer, and the Hughes Charity Car Show will be back—bigger and better than ever—on 22 February 2015. I am excited that next year we will be raising much-needed funds for the important work done by the Kids With Cancer Foundation. I can report to the House that many of the great attractions that we had at last year's show will return, along with a whole host of new amusements that will be a hit with the entire family—and I can confirm, Deputy Speaker, that we will be having the Batmobile. I am also pleased to report that the major sponsors are back on board, including

        , Torch Publishing Company, Shannon's insurance, and Panania Diggers. More information is available at www.hughescarshow.com where people can find entry forms, along with a list of categories for the 'show and shine' competition. I look forward to seeing all of my electorate, and of course anyone else from across Sydney, New South Wales or Australia, for a great family day at Kelso Park on 22 February next year.
