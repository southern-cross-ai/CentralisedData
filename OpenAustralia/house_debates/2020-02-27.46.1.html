        I think it's pretty well known that I can't bat, I can't pitch, I can't throw and I can't catch. But I can cheer. And I will be cheering on the Wanneroo Giants women's team—which I sponsor—located at the Wanneroo Giants Baseball Club, the home of baseball in the north, at the Kingsway sporting complex. The club held a ladies day on 2 February, which I was unable to attend, so I caught up with the ladies team on Sunday, and they gave me my very own jersey: look, it's No. 1! I'm very excited about it. I'll be sure to wear my jersey the next time I throw the first pitch of the season—and maybe this time the ball won't bounce. I'm very excited about the Roo Girls, as they're referred to. They played a great game on Saturday, as they do each time they're out there on the diamond, with their enthusiasm, their passion and, of course, their sporting prowess. I want to give a shout-out to Greg Elliott, the president of the Giants, and to Dazza Riley, vice-president and life member, for their dedication and especially for their work in promoting the women's team. Player numbers at the club continue to grow, and the Giants are always snapped up to play for the Perth heat in the
