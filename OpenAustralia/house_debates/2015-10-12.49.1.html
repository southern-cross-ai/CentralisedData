        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        's Logan Campus for their 2015 Adult Learners' Week celebrations, which I attended with the member for Rankin. Adult Learners' Week in Australia is part of the International Festival of Adult Learning, which each year is celebrated with events that encourage and promote the benefits of learning, whether it is in the home, at work or in the community. Griffith University's event was a great way to promote the fact that it is never too late to take on new learning opportunities, pursue a new career path and achieve anything your heart desires.

        Among the many stories I heard were those of juggling life as a mature age student when you have many responsibilities and commitments, and how it is a challenging yet rewarding experience. I would like to take this opportunity to mention one of my local residents, Pip Giles, who courageously challenged herself by doing a heartfelt presentation during the event about her university journey so far. Pip is currently completing a Bachelor of Human Services, and her story is enormously encouraging. Author John Danalis also spoke about his journey as a mature age student and about his book,

        . It was a story that was enriching and reminded many of us that we all create amazing life stories. Well done to Di Mahoney from Griffith University, who did a great job in putting Adult Learners' Week together.
