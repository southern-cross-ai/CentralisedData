         We are continuing to roll out the community infrastructure program. Today we have announced some 146 ready-to-go local infrastructure projects in regional

            He has no idea. Money is already being rolled out for these programs. More than 300 council projects have already been approved. Over 129 contracts have already been signed with local government. But it is not inconsistent for this current opposition to have a local government spokesperson who opposes funding for local government, because we have local members who oppose funding for their local schools. Today we had an extraordinary spectacle. Can you imagine the tactics committee meeting this morning? There would have been about 20 of them sitting there, because everyone gets a guernsey. They are sitting there and the member for Dickson says: ‘I’ve got a good idea. I’ve got the government. They’re providing funds for Eatons Hill State School. It has 960 kids and they’re going to support them getting a hall. They’re going to support them getting upgrades. Let’s really get into them. Let’s have four questions on that.’

                  In this chamber there is an obstacle to the rollout of funding for primary schools; to the rollout of the community infrastructure program; to the rollout of support for railway crossings; to the rollout of support for road spending—to the rollout of these projects. There is an obstacle and those opposite indicate through their interjections who it is. Those opposite are obsessed with their own internal processes—that is why during question time today they conducted a number of ballots. Relax, Malcolm, I understand it was not about the leadership. They spent the whole of question time filling in ballots on the back bench and on the front bench. They were not concerned with issues of concern to Australians, because they are simply out of touch. They and their tactics committee are also out of their depth.
