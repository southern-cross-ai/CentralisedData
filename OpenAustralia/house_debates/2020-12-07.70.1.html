        My question is also to the Prime Minister. Why has the Prime Minister budgeted $15 million for his latest ad campaign but refused to fix the situation for Australian parents that punishes them for working a fourth or a fifth day? Why won't the Prime Minister adopt Labor's cheaper childcare plan, which will make child care more affordable for 97 per cent of families and, in addition, will boost economic growth?

         Labor can say what they say, but Australians will remember what they did. Under Labor, childcare fees increased by 53 per cent. I remember this, because some of us in this place have been around a bit longer than others. But the Leader of the Opposition, who has been around here longer than me, will know this: prior to the 2007 election, the Labor Party made all these great promises of how they were going to reform child care and make it work. But what was the result? A 53 per cent increase in childcare fees. That's what happens when Labor promise to solve a problem: you always end up paying more. Labor's solutions always cost you more than they will ever tell you. Not only do they rarely work; at the same time, their demonstrated incompetence in government demonstrates that whatever they try to fix they only make worse. That is their experience. That is why the Australian people got rid of them. That's why, under our government, we are taking the Australian economy forward.

         He's very lippy today, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition is very lippy today. He must be under a bit of pressure this week. I don't know what that's about. But what I know is that, every time this Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party promise to fix a problem for you, all you end up with is the bill.
