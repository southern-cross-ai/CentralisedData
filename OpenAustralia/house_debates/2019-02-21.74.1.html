        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government is united in taking action to deliver a stronger economy and keep Australians safe and secure? Is the Prime Minister aware of any other approaches?

         Our government is united on our stronger plan for our economy, our government is united on securing our nation and the results that we have achieved with the implementation of our plan over the last 5½ years and we're united on ensuring that we have a stronger Australia. The last two weeks in this place have shown that the Labor Party is hopelessly divided when it comes to what is required to create a stronger economy, to protect jobs in our most important export industries in the country and to ensure stronger borders. They have failed the test when it comes to being united, together, on these important issues in the country. And the Labor Party leader has failed the test of character. He has failed the test of character of uniting his party when it comes to standing up for jobs in traditional industries—because what did we hear from the member for Corio? We heard from the member for Corio that it would be wonderful if the market for traditional mining products was to collapse, threatening the jobs of 53,400 coalminers across the country. The member for Herbert sits there silently while the jobs of people in Townsville are put at risk because of a divided Labor Party when it comes to the traditional industries of this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, on this side of the House, we will fight for jobs. We will fight for jobs in the mining industry; we will fight for jobs in the forestry industry, as I announced with the Tasmanian forestry hubs policy last weekend; and we'll fight for the jobs in the farming and agricultural sector. We will always fight for these jobs. Today we learnt that 65,000 full-time jobs were created in the month of January, and the unemployment rate remains at a 7½-year low at five per cent. We know that in the last year around 85 per cent of the jobs that were created, some 270,000 or thereabouts, I understand, were full time—full-time jobs being created in this country.

         , they have led the charge. In New South Wales, the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9 per cent. That is the lowest rate on a 40-year record. How good is

         , delivering a stronger economy for New South Wales and ensuring that our national economy is strong as well? And we'll continue to work strongly with the New South Wales government, because they've been our partner.
        </p>
        <p>
         One and a quarter million jobs—that's our target. That's what we'll achieve with our economic plan. How do we know we'll achieve that? Because we've created over 1.25 million jobs since we were elected—on the first occasion. We are united on creating jobs. We're united on protecting our borders. We're united on our traditional industries. The Labor Party is hopelessly divided, under this leader, on those issues.
