        Last Friday I had the opportunity to visit Echuca and to visit Community Living &amp; Respite Services' new project that is getting built in Eyre Street, Echuca. It is a $1.1 million residential building that has the opportunity for four supported living apartments. There will be two independent living apartments and a separate room for an activity area. It certainly is amazing construction that is going on. I congratulate Mark O'Mahoney, the builder. That project looks like it is due to be finished in the middle of this year. There was a $350,000 commitment from the coalition government towards this construction of these living arrangements, and that money was delivered through the

        We also took an opportunity to go and visit Kim in her house, because her building was built last year. She has been living there along with three others who need supported accommodation and along with some supported-accommodation workers, as well as a couple of other independent living clients who the Community Living &amp; Respite Services from Echuca are able to provide accommodation for. This project is only $50,000 short of being fully funded, and I call on all of the Echuca community to continue to get behind thisâ€”
