         Last Tuesday
        </a>
        , I was delighted to accompany the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_Stirling_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Governor Stirling Senior High School
        </a>
        in Woodbridge in Hasluck. The foreign minister was well received by the students there and received a welcome to country in language by Sheldon. Together they engaged in an array of really well thought-out questions that ranged across a variety of topics: the minister's own inspirations in politics, gender, race, her sexuality, climate policy, immigration, the economy, the campaign for the Voice to Parliament and advice that she might be able to offer to the younger generations. The minister encouraged the students to engage in the political life of their community and also shared aspects of the way in which she's managed her own career.

        I thank Senator Wong for taking the time to visit the Governor Stirling school. Her warmth, generosity and honesty in answering the students' questions were inspirational. Seeing the young students' enthusiastic faces and hearing that high level of engagement, I know that this was a visit of lasting influence. Who knows, perhaps we'll see a future foreign affairs minister emerge from that cohort, too. Our country will be well served by having any one of those students in positions of national leadership. We didn't, of course, allow enough time for selfies with all the students and the staff who wanted them with Minister Wong, so we will need to visit again. I thank Principal Leo Surjan and his team, the incredible, wonderful staff of this great school. I look forward to seeing the students develop in their careers ahead.
