        For hundreds of years the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian people
        </a>
        have been persecuted. It has taken the form of kidnapping, torture and public shaming. They were uprooted from their homes and forced to rebuild their lives as dispersed fragments in different parts of the globe, resulting in a scattered nation.

        people are minority groups who have fled the wars in their traditional homeland, which encompasses Iraqi, Syria, parts of Turkey and Iran.

       <p>
        Australians of Assyrian heritage commemorated their martyrs on 7 August. I joined the Australian Assyrian community of Fowler in honouring the Assyrian martyrs who gave their lives in various massacres and atrocities and who sacrificed their lives in many wars, including Anzac battles alongside our Australian soldiers in Gallipoli. It was a privilege to take part in commemorative events on two occasions: one hosted by the Coalition of the Assyrian Parties in Australia and the other by the

        </a>
        . Considering the large

         Assyrian Australian
        </a>
        population in my Fowler electorate, it is imperative that we remember and commemorate their martyrs and the sacrifices they have made.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Assyrians are an ancient civilisation that established the first library and introduced the earliest known laws and regulations, which are the foundation of most countries around the world. It is because of these laws that we are here today to democratically represent our people. It is my honour to be representing this community in Fowler. I look forward to your continued success in Australia and beyond.
