        . So many local sports men and women have done our region and our country proud and really delivered some fantastic results. This includes Riley Fitzsimmons in the K-4 1,000 metres; Nicola McDermott in the high jump; Kye Rowles in the men's football; Lachlan Tame in the men's canoe sprint, K-2 1,000 metres;

        Every representative did Australia proud and has a story worth shouting from the rooftops. Two such examples include Charlie Hunter, who represented Australia in the men's 800-metre run. Charlie grew up in Terrigal and started his career at Duffys Oval at Terrigal's Little Athletics and then at Gosford Little Athletics. Charlie comes from a sporting family, with his mother representing Australia in two sports and his uncle being a renowned Australian cricketer. He made it to the semifinals for the 800 metresâ€”a fantastic effort. Tascott local Nicola McDermott was introduced to athletics when she was seven and quickly found her niche in high jump. Nicola always had a dream to go to the Olympics. She not only made it, but she won a silver medal and broke the Australian national record. Nicola, you've done yourself, your family and your whole community proud. I want to congratulate each and every athlete who represented our region and our nation at the Olympics.
