        I am pleased to be able to rise to speak this afternoon about the importance of men's sheds in my electorate of Robertson. They are very important community hubs for those people who seek mateship and company in a welcoming and inclusive environment. Today I am pleased to say that the Erina Community Men's Shed will receive a grant of $5,500 as part of this government's funding of $400,000 for more than 100 men's sheds across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This particular men's shed has only had its doors open since February, but it is fast becoming like a second home for around 50 locals on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . At the Erina men's shed they join together to work on projects such as woodworking and repairing, and they can speak openly about issues related to health, their general wellbeing or whatever happens to be on their minds. I am informed that, while they started meeting on Fridays, it has become such a busy, demanding place that they are now open on Thursdays as well, which is fantastic news. This $5,500 grant will mean that they can construct an all-weather awning on the shed, which will give them more space and even more opportunities to be of service to the community on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has been an initiative of Erina Baptist Community Care. The

        , Jeff Blair, has told me that they are absolutely thrilled to be able to receive this level of support from the federal government. So I say well done to Jeff and the Erina Community Men's Shed chairman,
