         Sydney Adventist Hospital
        </a>
        at Wahroonga is a much loved and respected institution in my electorate of Bradfield, fondly known as 'the San'. It is the largest private hospital in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and each year its dedicated staff care for over 56,000 in-patients, 10,000 emergency patients and 135,000 outpatients.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week the San is holding the San Run for Life, which is a five-kilometre or 10-kilometre fun run, to raise money for the San Foundation and specifically to support the hospital's new integrated cancer centre, ensuring that the centre has the world-class equipment required to provide high-quality treatment. Some $20 million is required to complete this centre. Some $13 million has already been raised, and I want to pay tribute to those individuals and companies which have donated so generously to raise that very impressive sum. The new centre is part of the San's major redevelopment which was officially opened last year by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. At a cost of $200 million, this redevelopment was completely privately funded. It includes a new maternity ward, a women's health and children's unit, a new 34-bed intensive care unit and capacity for an additional 35,000 admissions per year.

        fun run was formerly held every year, but during the construction phase it unfortunately had to go into abeyance, as the route runs through the hospital campus. Happily, however, this year the SAN Run for Life has recommenced and there has been very strong community response. The participants in the SAN fun run are going to include several of my state colleagues—the member for Ku-ring-gai, Alister Henskens; the member for Hornsby, Matt Kean; the member for Davidson,

        —as well as former SAN chief executive Dr Leon Clark, who was a prime mover in the redevelopment of the SAN, and hundreds if not thousands of local residents and community members.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been some big talk in the local media from some of my colleagues about the times they intend to run, and I commend them for their boldness. For myself, I will be pleased just to participate. I make absolutely no assurances as to the time that I will achieve. But I am very pleased to have the chance to participate in the SAN Run for Life, joining with many local residents and supporters of the SAN. This is a tremendously important community event. It is an opportunity to engage in some community fitness and participation, as well as to support a tremendously important institution: the Sydney Adventist Hospital at Wahroonga.
