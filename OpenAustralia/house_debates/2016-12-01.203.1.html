        We have all heard of Y gen., a name for a particular generation, but today I am giving an introduction to YGON. It stands for Your Gilmore Opinion Network. It is a plan for community members to get involved in sharing their views on important questions that are related to legislation or just ideas to make things better. The official launch of YGON will be on Saturday, 10 December between one and four at Harry Sawkins Park in Nowra. This event is free of charge and is partnered with the Touched by Olivia Foundation. They will have a sausage sizzle. There will also be family activities such as face-painting, a jumping castle and the Shoalhaven Zoo to You. I invite Gilmore residents to come and participate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Talking about participation: I really must congratulate a number of people who are or will be celebrating their contribution to the improvement of the lives of very special people. This Saturday, 3 December is the

        . They won the Excellence in Community Partnerships Award. I could not have been more proud of their achievement.

       <p>
        This special day is designed to celebrate the progress made in breaking down barriers, opening doors and creating an inclusive society for those with a disability. Slice of Life Australia has always been a stand out organisation. Karen Anstiss was the founder of this enterprise and has grown it from a hospitality training and service provider for hearing impaired to a cafe style catering and full disability employer and branching out to a vegetable growing enterprise and also a second-hand clothes boutique, each enterprise employing young people with a disability.

        amenities blocks. Many a minister in this House knows of her work. Yumaro, in Moruya, is a stand-out operation for Gilmore. It is new to my electorate. I have spent time with Mark Brantingham and his superb team at the centre of operations, where they rightly showcase their business enterprise. They have shared a vision for disability housing for their clients, and are well on the way with a co-funded grant from us to build that accommodation. They also received a grant for stronger communities to fulfil more business activities. Budawang School and Havenlea are making considerable inroads for the children attending their schools. Jess is one of their graduates, and she was at Surfing for the Disabled. A huge congratulations to the staff, parents and helpers at all these special places.

        I have to say, though, that the community in the Ulladulla region will be excited to hear that the Jindelara stronger regions grant has been confirmed. This was a project that has been about five years in the making. With steady and consistent fundraising they have gain $358,000 to go towards that project and complete it.
