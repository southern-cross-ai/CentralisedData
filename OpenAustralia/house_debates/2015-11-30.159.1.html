        It is always a terrific opportunity to stand in this House and celebrate some of the wonderful events that go on in our electorates each week. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about some of the fantastic events that I had the opportunity to attend over the weekend. Firstly, I would like to congratulate Soroptimist International Beenleigh for organising the annual walk to end domestic violence on Saturday in the Beenleigh Town Centre. This was the fourth walk of its kind. The event was supported by Bravehearts, with founder

        taking part. It was also supported by our outstanding police, who do such tremendous work in the community and who unfortunately have to deal face-to-face with the effects of family and domestic violence. It was also great to see so many members of the community supporting this event and joining together to protest against domestic and family violence and to support White Ribbon Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the weekend, the Beenleigh Tennis Club hosted the home tie for the Asia-Pacific Tennis League. The Beenleigh Blaze were in terrific form. If they had won the tie, they would have progressed to the national final. Unfortunately that was not to be the case; whilst the women had great success, the men were not so successful. But it is terrific to see so many people there supporting our local tennis club, and also the terrific efforts by all of the players, the volunteers, the ball boys and the coaches. It was a terrific event and very well run. Beenleigh Tennis Club is well recognised for the quality of the competitions that they run.

        celebrated their 70th birthday on Saturday with a ceremony, a concert and an afternoon tea. I would like to thank District Leader Jackie McSwain for inviting me along to attend these celebrations. The Girl Guides are a terrific organisation that does tremendous work in our local community. I would like commend Jackie and her leadership team, but also all the volunteers at Beenleigh Girl Guides and all the young women that take part there, for the terrific work that they do in our local community. The Beenleigh Family Centre held their inaugural community Christmas fair on Saturday, and it was great to see them getting involved in the community. It was a great turnout, and the opportunity to celebrate with friends and neighbours. It was a great community success.

        Finally, I would like to recognise the efforts of Heather Redman and the team at Loganlea Community Centre who do an amazing job every year handing out Christmas hampers to people in need in our community. Heather shared with me that it has been a difficult year, with many more in need than usual. I ask that anybody who has the opportunity donate a gift or money, to any Christmas appeal, to help those less fortunate in our community at this time of year.
