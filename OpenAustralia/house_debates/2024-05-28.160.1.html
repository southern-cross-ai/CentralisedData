       <p>
        The Albanese government knows that many families in Australia are doing it tough and that cost of living is front and centre in their minds. During the Dunkley by-election campaign, I heard from a young woman in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrum_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Carrum Downs
        </a>
        who was training to be an early childhood educator. Her rent had increased substantially, and she and her partner were selling household items in order to pay the rent. The Albanese government has those people who are struggling with the cost of living in mind and delivered a budget to support them. Just over a week ago, we announced a $325 energy rebate and a $300 per week practical placement payment for students studying midwifery, nursing, teaching and social work. We also worked on, and delivered, the elimination of a $3 billion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS
        </a>
        debt, and 18,000 people from Dunkley will benefit from that change. This budget also delivers a 10 per cent increase to Commonwealth rent assistance, benefiting close to one million households across Australia and nearly 7,000 households in Dunkley.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is also investing about $4 million to deliver cheaper medicines to ease pressure on household budgets. Patients who have a concession card or who are on a pension are set to save even more thanks to our freeze on the maximum cost of PBS medication at $7.70 per prescription. We are also working to strengthen Medicare, investing $2.8 billion by providing an additional 29 Medicare urgent care clinics. The Frankston clinic is open from eight until 10 o'clock Monday to Sunday and provides free, high-quality care for patients with non-life-threatening injuries and illness. All you need is your Medicare card. In addition to this, we have more free mental health services, higher Medicare rebates for common medical tests and a women's health package worth over $160 million, with new initiatives focusing on endometriosis, pain, and supporting women and families after a miscarriage. We also passed reforms on paid parental leave, ensuring that, from 1 July, Australian families will be better off. By 2026, every family with a new baby will be able to access a total of six months paid leave, shared between the two parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing is obviously a big issue across the country. In Dunkley, 59.5 per cent of household families are low-income families. To work to address this, the government has invested significant funding in the construction of new homes. The policies and funding are focused on increasing supply, supply and supply, ensuring more Australians have a roof over their head and aren't sleeping rough, particularly women impacted by domestic and family violence. To support women to leave relationships where there is domestic and family violence, a $5,000 escaping family violence payment has been locked in, with support to referral services, risk assessments and safety planning being part of the strategy. Further, the Albanese government has legislated 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave, increased rent assistance with the largest increase in 30 years, and invested in crisis accommodation and affordable housing for women and children escaping violence. In addition to this, the eligibility for parenting payments has been expanded, helping 82,000 more single parents remain on higher payments until their youngest child turns 14. There has been $6 billion in new measures announced by the Treasurer and the Minister for Housing to build more homes and support Australians, bringing our government's new housing initiatives over the next decade to more than $30 billion.

        Just last Saturday, I was talking to Tony from Frankston. He spoke to me about the reality. He and his wife are both working. They are renting in the local area, having had to move from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        due to the increase in rental prices. He mentioned that, despite both him and his wife working, he is likely to have to move again and out of the area in the next 12 months. He is nervous about homelessness, due to the increasing cost of rent and the lack of housing supply.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help" rel="nofollow">
         The Help

        to Buy scheme will support 40,000 Australian households to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. This sort of investment in housing, an investment the previous government neglected for over 10 years, is what the Labor government is going to do to support people like Tony.
       </p>
       <p>
        While on prepoll, I spoke to many families with teenagers who were keen for their children to get a great education however concerned about the cost of university and HECS fees. At the time, I was able to share with them the information on the fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        program that could support their children to access courses at Chisholm and other TAFE colleges in the south-east. This initiative has offered over 355 fee-free TAFE places in 2023. I am thrilled to announce this funding has been expanded and will offer an additional 300,000 places across 2024-26 for students studying in areas of priority skills. In addition to this, apprentices in priority occupations will be eligible for an incentive of $5,000 to assist with cost-of-living pressures and to support them to finish their training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two thousand apprentices will be working towards a nationally recognised qualification in Dunkley. To support businesses with employers taking on apprentices in priority occupations, we will also provide an incentive of $5,000. This means more opportunities for secure, well-paid work and more skilled workers in the construction and housing workforce that can build more homes in communities like Dunkley. This government wants to ensure that, no matter what, no matter where you come from, whether it's Frankston, Carrum Downs, Langwarrin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza" rel="nofollow">

        , you get a fair go and you can purchase a house of your choosing, close to your place of work, and don't have to spend hours commuting.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an aspirational budget that is focused on supporting people that are struggling now and setting this country and its people up for the future. My colleagues and I are determined to make the lives of those we represent in our communities, like Dunkley, better now and into the future. This budget reflects this vision. It reflects that the Albanese government is listening. We are acting on the issues that are most important now, and we are planning for the future. This budget is better for families, better for young people, better for women, better for Dunkley, better for the nation. The budget invests in building back for a better future so everyone can get ahead and no-one is left behind.

        <p>
         I rise this evening to speak to the growing pain that's being endured by Australians under the leadership of this Albanese Labor government. It has been two years since the Labor government was elected. They promised a $275 reduction in your power bills, they promised cheaper mortgages, and they promised to make Australian families better off. The Albanese Labor government have now had three budgets, but the decisions they've made have just made it harder for families and for our communities. Labor are failing Aussie families, and small businesses in particular. They are doing it really tough. Put simply, Labor's promises have been broken.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         Governor has noted, our inflation is now largely homegrown. It's what some of us like to call 'Jimflation'. Under Labor, Australia's inflation is worse than the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , Singapore, Germany, Spain, Japan, the Netherlands, Italy,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          South Korea
         </a>
         , Canada, France and the entire Euro area. It's worse because of Labor's weak economic management, including $315 billion in extra spending, a 5.4 per cent fall in productivity and, of course, the dangerous renewables-only energy policy that is driving up power prices. After two years of Labor, a typical family with a mortgage is now more than $35,000 worse off. Australians know that despite the Treasurer's spin—and perhaps he is a doctor of spin—prices have increased by nearly 10 per cent, with increases for many essential items well beyond that. Housing is up 12 per cent. Rents are up 12 per cent. Electricity is up 18 per cent. The list goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
         While Australians are struggling to pay mortgages and rents, Labor is making the housing crisis worse by bringing in a record 1.67 million migrants over the next five years. While immigration continues to soar, Labor isn't delivering enough houses. Labor is always focused on the wrong priorities. A distracted Labor government has also just delivered one of the most irresponsible budgets in living memory according to several senior and respected economists. Labor's budget fails the economic tests and, more concerningly, it was a self-styled 'quintessentially Labor' budget. That is something that every Australian should be concerned about because when Labor can't manage its budget, it makes it much harder for Australians to manage theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
         In these uncertain economic times, we needed a budget that went back to basics. This means a budget that restored our standard of living by finally addressing inflation and the pressures being felt by families at the checkout and with their energy bills. A budget that restored prosperity and created opportunity by supporting small businesses and helping young Australians into a home. A budget that restored budget discipline and honesty by restraining spending, bringing back the fiscal guard rails, a tax-to-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         cap and delivering a structural surplus, not a windfall surplus. Labor's third budget has failed on all these tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         But since coming to government they have managed one thing, one really big thing: 36,000 more bureaucrats in Canberra. They've also managed to spend nearly $500 million on a divisive and failed referendum. And they have managed to break promises and raise taxes. Believe me, when Labor run out of money they will come after yours.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I highlighted earlier, Labor's decisions are making inflation even worse. Under Labor there has been an additional $315 billion of government spending. Extra spending doesn't take pressure off inflation; in fact, it makes it worse. It's the phenomenon that I like to call 'Jimflation'. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
          RBA
         </a>
         Governor has confirmed that inflation is homegrown. It means that the Reserve Bank knows full well, as we all do, that inflation is a direct consequence of Labor's bad decisions and wrong priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite their lofty statements prior to the last election, Labor have trashed our standard of living. Over the last two years of the Albanese Labor government, family budgets have been smashed by higher prices, higher mortgage repayments and higher taxes. Ask yourself this simple question: am I better off today than I was two years ago under a coalition government? Across the electorate that I represent everyone knows that they are worse off under Labor.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is nothing in the current budget that restores what has been lost. Families and small businesses are feeling the impact of Labor's failures. And while Labor has floundered in government, a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Dutton
         </a>
         led coalition team has a plan to get Australia back on track. Coalition governments know how to manage the economy and secure our borders. We will remove the complexity and hostility of Labor's industrial relations agenda, which is putting unreasonable burdens on businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just on the weekend, at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_Cove" rel="nofollow">
          Sanctuary Cove
         </a>
         boat show, I was talking to a major local boatbuilder, who said, 'These new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
          IR
         </a>
         laws are going to destroy us.' I asked, 'Well, what about your power bills?' They said that their power bills had doubled in the last five years. It's quite extraordinary, what has been going on under this terrible Labor government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition has vowed to extend the value of assets eligible for the instant asset write-off to $30,000 and make this an ongoing and permanent feature for small business. We will simplify approval processes and cut back on Labor's red tape, which is killing mining jobs and entrepreneurialism. We will provide lower, simpler and fairer taxes for all, because Australians should keep more of what they earn. Importantly, we will ensure that Australians have affordable, reliable and consistent power.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will also revitalise the Australian homeownership dream. I see the struggle of aspiring homeowners all too often in the electorate of Fadden. To address this, we will implement a two-year ban on foreign investors and temporary residents purchasing existing homes in Australia, reduce the permanent migration program by 25 per cent, and reduce the excessive numbers of foreign students studying at metropolitan universities, to relieve stress on the rental markets in our major cities. We will work constructively with all levels of government to increase supply.
        </p>
        <p>
         After two years of Labor leadership, not many people are feeling more financially secure, safer in their communities or better off. With less than a year to go until the next federal election, it is clear that the Prime Minister has been distracted and doesn't have any solutions. Only a coalition government can return us to economic prosperity and restore our standard of living.
