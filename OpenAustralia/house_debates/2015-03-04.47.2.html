        My question is to the Prime Minister. I know that every member of parliament is alarmed at family violence as the No. 1 cause of homelessness amongst women; and I know that every member of parliament is appalled that this year already on average two women have been killed each week as a result of violence from a partner or a former partner. Will the Prime Minister keep an open mind to Labor's ideas announced today and meet with me to discuss our idea about holding a national crisis summit to deal with Australia's family violence epidemic?

         It is a very good question that the Leader of the Opposition poses—a very good question, indeed, because domestic violence is a big issue in our country. For too long it has been hidden, and just because the crime happens behind closed door does not make it any less of a crime. In fact, sometimes it can be even more of an even more horrific crime, because it happens in the home, and the home should be a sanctuary for everyone, particularly for women and children. I absolutely agree with the Leader of the Opposition; I take his concerns extremely seriously on this issue. He is absolutely right: not only have two women a week died in domestic violence so far this year, but, in the course of their lifetimes, one in three women will suffer from domestic violence.

         I am very conscious of the fact that yesterday both the Leader of the Opposition and I pledged to be men who stand up for women. Yes, it is true that the government has already got Rosie Batty and

         </a>
         advising us on this subject. Yes, it is true that the Council of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         —the premiers, the Prime Minister and the chief ministers—have put domestic violence on our agenda for the April meeting. Yesterday at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
          National Press Club
         </a>
         , the minister assisting me pledged $15 million to a national awareness campaign with the states on this subject. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition: this is not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a big issue; it is an issue that all of us should be concerned about; it is an issue that all of us are concerned about; it is an issue that could easily unite, and should unite, this parliament. I am very happy to agree to sit down with the Leader of the Opposition to discuss what both of us, and what all of us, can do to ensure that we get better outcomes on this issue. That is because the people who are cowering in their own homes and the people who are frightened of those who should love them deserve the care and concern of this parliament.
