        I rise to inform the House about the Stronger Communities Program round 2 in my electorate and some of the important projects within it. The Elizabeth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        received around $19,700 for a car park upgrade. That was very important. Trevor Sloan, the president, has been a big advocate for that club, and this important upgrade will help upgrade not just the car park but also the memorial. That will be a big asset to the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Brahma Lodge Footy Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
         Shaun Ryan

        has been advocating for a scoreboard replacement for some time, and that club has received $20,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mallala and Districts Mens Shed Incorporated is just at the beginning of their project. They have it half built. They are a very keen group of men who are utilising the Work for the Dole program as well. They are moving forward to stage 2 of their project.

        Mallala Bowling Club has had a floodlight upgrade. Graham Cordon and Peter March put that application together, and it was good to visit both those project in Mallala the other day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also visited the Stockport Community Association. Brian Koch,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_French" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Dennis Burman all put together an application to improve and identify the gravestones in what is a very historic graveyard out at Stockport. Brian Koch is a big supporter of mine and so I know he will like me mentioning him in the federal parliament.

        Freeling RSL is clearing some trees to advance a future project, a much bigger project, and Garry Shearing has been instrumental in the removal of some of the old pine trees at the Freeling footy ground, where I played as a lad.

        Greenock has three projects. One is for aircon installation in the local institute. I can tell you from personal experience how important that is. We met there after the fire. I have to thank Geoff Saegenschnitter, Ray Obst and Trevor Waldhuter for that. I also have to thank Mick Schluter and Geoff again for their application to upgrade the oval's toilets so that they can accommodate

        s. At the Greenock Cricket Club, Max McClaren, the president, and David Nitschke, the general manager, are putting in place a plant and maintenance shed. I know that is important for the existing upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Lions Club of Clare are constructing a bird hide and garden shed, and that will be enjoyed by all the bird watchers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just thought I would update the House on all these good local projects.
