        The Albanese Labor government is investing in housing, including in my community of Jagajaga. Last week I was really pleased to join with the member for Ivanhoe, Anthony Carbines; and Victorian minister Harriet Shing to announce new social and affordable housing for the Bell Bardia estate in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Heidelberg" rel="nofollow">
         West Heidelberg
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell" rel="nofollow">
         The Bell
        </a>
        Bardia estate will now benefit from a $27.5 million investment from the federal government to deliver 53 new social homes. That will be added to, with the Victorian government contributing an additional $27.5 million for 51 affordable dwellings. We will have 104 new social and affordable homes on the Bell Bardia estate in West Heidelberg.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a great outcome for my community. The Bell/Bardia site has long been part of the West Heidelberg community. It previously hosted social housing, but that housing was rundown, and it had to be demolished. I am so pleased that this important part of the 3081 community will now be revitalised and that we will have53 social homes and 51 affordable homes built there. This is replacing what were rundown homes, renewing the estate and making sure that we continue to have social and affordable housing available in West Heidelberg.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thanks also goes to the community in West Heidelberg because I know that they are so supportive of this outcome, that they value the Bell Bardia estate and that they will be pleased to see this new housing going up there. We will now have a consultation process about the development, and I know that people will participate in that in good faith because, like me, they want to see social and affordable housing in West Heidelberg.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really pleased that this also means that all levels of government are working together to ensure those in my community and right across the nation can access the safety and security that comes with having your own home. This includes record investments that our government is making. This year's budget includes an additional $6.2 billion in new investments to build more homes more quickly right around the country, while also providing more immediate support for those in need. That brings the total spend by our government to more than $32 billion. It is just one of the areas where we are addressing community need at the moment.

        This 1 July our government will support Australians to deal with the very real cost-of-living pressures they are feeling. There's a larger tax cut on 1 July than they would have received from the former government, $300 in electricity bill relief for every Australian household, a pay rise for workers, cheaper medication and two weeks more paid parental leave. We know there is more to do, but our government is absolutely committed to supporting Australians and making sure that we are providing cost-of-living support for households in my community and right around the country.
