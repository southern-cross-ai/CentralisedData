       <p>
        Right now, thousands of people are completing Lindsay's biggest survey. Of those people, so many have already told me how important it is for them to see Dunheved Road upgraded. I've got some great news for the thousands of families who use this road every day and the thousands of small businesses who need to move their great Aussie-made products around our community and beyond.

        has endorsed the awarding of the tender for the investigation and design of the project. This is the next important step along the way in delivering the upgrade that our community fought so hard to achieve.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week I met with the Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts to discuss this project, because I want to see progress continue to be made as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister knows, the Treasurer knows, the minister for urban infrastructure knows—everyone in the Morrison government knows—how much this project means to people in my community, families and businesses, because I have been pushing from day one, with my community backing me, to secure the full $127 million for the complete upgrade to Dunheved Road. Our community has been there from the start, from that very first signature on my petition, and I truly believe that together we can achieve anything. I'll continue to update the people in my community of Lindsay on this critical upgrade as it gets underway.
