        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why does the Prime Minister believe that he shouldn't be subject to the normal rules of integrity and accountability, demonstrated by his failure to answer questions about why he prevented any member from speaking on his union-bashing bill today, why he has repeatedly misled the parliament, why he interfered in a

          The Prime Minister will pause for a second. The level of interjections is ridiculously high. A number of members have been mentioned and warned. Just to be very clear about it, I won't allow a wall of noise to interrupt question time. I'm issuing a general warning. What that means, for those who haven't experienced it before, is that I'll exercise my authority under standing order 94(a) without a warning. It also means that, if I move to name someone, the warning is now. The Prime Minister has the call.

           Thank you, Mr Speaker. I reject the smears that have been put by those opposite in framing that question and I would invite them to put questions about matters of policy—matters of aged care, as we already have had from one of the members, which I'm happy to take. I think that was a very important issue for the member to raise. If all this Leader of the Opposition has is smears and accusations and dramatising in this parliament, if that's all this Leader of the Opposition has—

              The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. With the range of topics covered in the question and the nature of the question going to the Prime Minister, I can't at all see how he's not being relevant to the question. You simply cannot ask a question like that, which is very broad in nature, and then try and insist that there be a very narrow answer. The Prime Minister is in order.

               Thank you, Mr Speaker. So, if all the Leader of the Opposition has got is grubby smears, and if that's how he wishes to define himself as a Leader of the Opposition, then I think the Australian public will see this Leader of the Opposition for what he is. All this Leader of the Opposition is demonstrating to the Australian people is that he's like those who would seek to glue themselves to buses and trucks and various things. If you want to know what those who just seek to disrupt the ordinary, everyday activities of Australians look like when they grow a little older, you only need to look at this Leader of the Opposition. The protest T-shirt may be a little tighter than it was many years ago, but this is just a very angry man.

                  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Unfortunately, I think what the record will show is the question made a number of accusations and the Prime Minister's making some in return. That tends to happen. The Prime Minister has the call.

                  <p>
                   I understand the Leader of the Opposition is very angry. He's very angry because the government is standing up for those who do not want to see thuggery and bullying, particularly against women, as part of their workplace. The Labor Party like to talk big about these issues, but, when it comes to calling them to account and asking them to outlaw thuggish and bullying behaviour in this country, this is their reaction—smears, accusations and even attacking people's faith. I'm not intimidated by the Leader of the Opposition or any of the Labor Party members—

I can't. But I'm happy to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business.

                            No, I don't need the member for Cowan, nor the Manager of Opposition Business. I'm not in a position to judge whether no-one's questioned his faith.

                             Mr Speaker, there are two issues. The first is in terms of what the question went to. The question went specifically to areas where the Prime Minister has failed to answer questions. Then it gave a list of examples. All of those are well and truly in the public domain. Secondly, it would assist the dignity of the House if the Prime Minister were given the opportunity to withdraw.

                                The minister's not helping. I listened very carefully to the Prime Minister, and the Manager of Opposition Business is right that there have been occasions where people have been told it would assist the dignity of the House to withdraw. There have been a number of occasions today where, if things hadn't been said, it would have assisted the dignity of the House—or if they'd been withdrawn. I'm not going to require a withdrawal. I am going to say there are other means open to members, including, if they think that is a misrepresentation, to take that. But I can think of many, many examples of very tough language like that—and I will say it was tough—that have occurred. Had it been the case that it was very personalised and went directly to the person, that would be a different matter, and on that I caution all members speaking. The Prime Minister has concluded his answer? He's got 22 seconds.
