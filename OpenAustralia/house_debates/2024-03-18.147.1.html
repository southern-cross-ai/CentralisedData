        Generosity, spirit and community are everywhere in Barton, particularly in the vital work performed by our community organisations. Take for example the Fix It Sisters Shed in Kyeemagh. With the assistance of the government's Stronger Communities grants, they've been able to create a welcoming community for women of all ages who put their hands and minds to work getting on the tools and building beautiful things, including huts for penguins in Tasmania.

        St George provide a space for other groups in Barton with the support of the Stronger Communities grants. That includes the Rockdale Seniors Basketball Club, providing people of all ages a social environment to stay active in and have fun.

        The Chinese Australian Social Services cares for our community in many ways.

        's early learning centre in Hurstville is one of these important services. It was great to see for myself how the Stronger Communities grants have helped them upgrade their facilities for the families they support. It was such a pleasure to spend this time with such gorgeous little ones and the educators preparing them for school.

        Many Muslims in Barton have begun observing Ramadan, so many of my constituents have contacted me about the pain of seeing friends, family and loved ones caught up in the conflict in Gaza. For many, their prayers and reflections will be turning to their friends, family and loved ones in the

        . There is such grief and pain being felt across the entire community. For all those practising, particularly in the electorate of Barton, I hope the holy month brings ease for you. I hope this period is a reminder for all of us of our shared humanity. I join so many in wishing peace, security and dignity for all of our community.
