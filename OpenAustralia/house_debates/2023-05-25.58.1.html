        This Saturday,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPW" rel="nofollow">
         BPW
        </a>
        Caboolture—business and professional women—will host their annual business showcase event at the Morayfield Sport and Events Centre, behind Bunnings at Morayfield. This event will showcase local businesses from the Longman community to display their goods and services and give locals the opportunity to engage with these businesses and hopefully encourage all of us, where possible, to shop local. Doing as much business as possible in your local community has so many benefits, including ensuring locals have employment opportunities close to home, which will reduce traffic on our roads as well as allowing people to spend more time with family instead of in the car, bus or train commuting long distances to work.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be entertainment ranging from bands to dancing and boxing clubs, as well as guest speakers on a range of topics and around 70 local businesses represented. There's even a kids' corner with face-planting and colouring in for the little tuckers. For further details go to the BPW Caboolture Facebook page. Although this event is organised and run by BPW, it is not a women's only event for only female owned businesses; the ladies want me to stress that all are welcome. I encourage everyone to come along and support our local business community. The event starts at 10 am and runs through to 3 pm. My staff and I will be there, manning my stall during the event, to answer any questions constituents may have. It's only a gold coin donation for entry, so drop on in and say g'day. It's shaping up to be a great day.
