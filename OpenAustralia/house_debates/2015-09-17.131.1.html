        I rise to mention the outstanding sporting achievements of

        Schoolboy Cup grand final for the fourth year in a row. This is a remarkable achievement and something to be celebrated. Unfortunately, St Pats went down in the grand final yesterday to Townsville's

        at Pepper Stadium in Penrith.

        I pre-empted the member for Herbert, who I thought would be keen to rub it in. But he told me something quite touching.

        , who had been the principal of Kirwan State High School for 27 years, died of brain cancer earlier this year. The team also had to cope with the death of one of their star players earlier this year as well. I give credit where it is due to Kirwan State High School for their win under quite remarkable circumstances with those all of those difficulties going on.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also worth noting that yesterday's final marked 40 years since the first schoolboy rugby league grand final which featured Fairfield Patrician Brothers' College and Blacktown Boys High School in the then named AMCO Shield. It is true to say that we have a bit of a rugby league nursery in Greenway.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the semifinal, St Pats beat the Hills Sports High School, also in my electorate, to make it through to the grand final in what was, by all accounts, a thrilling match that saw Patrician Brothers' five-eighth Jarome Luai kick a field goal at the death to give Pats a 9-8 victory. Jerome also plays in the Holden Cup for Penrith, so watch this name. He will go very far.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done, also, to Hills Sports High School on a wonderful season. As two-time winners of the schoolboy competition, I know they will be in the mix again next year. To the Patties boys: sorry about your loss yesterday. Please know you have done your families and your school community very proud. To reach the grand final for a fourth consecutive year, out of the field of 450 schools, is a fantastic achievement and one that the entire school can celebrate. I also want to congratulate the coach, Greg Beacroft, and all the coaching staff at St Pats for their hard work and commitment to these fine young men. To their principal, Santo Passarello: Mr Passarello, congratulations on this achievement. I commend you and your school for representing the area of Blacktown so well both on and off the field.
