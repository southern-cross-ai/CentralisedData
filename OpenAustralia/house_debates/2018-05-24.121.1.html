        I rise today to acknowledge a significant event that took place in my electorate last Wednesday, 16 May. This was the consecration of the Anzac Memorial Garden at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hampton Park
        </a>
        's beloved Arthur Wren Hall. The Anzac Memorial Garden project was funded through the 2015 Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. This $17,500 project was proposed by the Hampton Park Progress Association, a group of people who are true residents of Hampton Park; they're always seeking to improve the spirit, the sense of community and the harmony in a very multicultural community in our area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The garden is located outside the hall, which is a significant and meaningful building to many of the residents of Hampton Park. The memorial garden displays a wonderful mural honouring our servicemen and servicewomen and pays homage to the locals who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country. The garden is a place for the community to reflect and to remember the sacrifices of our servicemen and servicewomen, particularly during the period of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . We are honoured at this consecration service to hear from Joice Robjant, whose brother served in the world war and whose name is on the plaque at the memorial garden. She gave a wonderful reading which captured the essence of the significance of this consecration and even brought along a photograph of her brother in his service uniform. The garden was consecrated by Reverend Mat Harry from the Hampton Park Uniting Church. Reverend Mat Harry, who is a wonderful human being, has been at the church since 2005. The consecration was fitting—for him, and for me to be there—because it was one of his last official engagements as the Reverend of the Hampton Park Uniting Church. Reverend Mat Harry has been a person who has been devoted to the Hampton Park community and I want to extend, on behalf of this parliament, all the best wishes for his future endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consecration itself would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the Hampton Park Progress Association, led by community champion Vanassa Gerdes. I'd like to thank the Hampton Park Progress Association for arranging this very special tribute during the Anzac centenary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        , and thank them for giving this memorial the recognition it very much deserves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hampton Park often doesn't get the recognition that is needs. If articles are written, they're basically written about things that might go wrong from time to time. My job in this place is to give voice to the Hampton Park community, and I'd like to say what a great community the Hampton Park community is, echoed by the work they do in honouring our servicemen and women, particularly remembering the sacrifices made in the First World War. I commend them and the Hampton Park community for the respect they show our servicemen and women.
