       <p>
        On Wednesday 22 November 2023 at 1 pm, one of the worst bushfires in my electorate of Pearce started.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few days, the fire has ravaged the suburbs of Mariginiup, Melaleuca, Jandabup, Wanneroo, Sinagra, Ashby, Tapping and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksia_Grove" rel="nofollow">
         Banksia Grove
        </a>
        , with 1,870 hectares burnt, 18 homes lost and five damaged as well as sheds and numerous vehicles lost. Infrastructure, including power poles and water assets, has been damaged and businesses have been impacted, including a local strawberry grower who lost their entire crop. The vast market garden community has also been under threat. My sincere thanks go to those who responded immediately to mitigate the impact of this huge wall of flames.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two weeks ago, I spoke in the House of Representatives about the importance of being bushfire ready. I would like to acknowledge the Department of Fire and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Services
        </a>
        Commissioner Darren Klemm and his team for their quick action in mobilising to fight tirelessly in response to the emergency; our local volunteer bushfire brigades within Pearce, whose skill sets and local knowledge have once again proved invaluable; Captain Paul Humphries of the Wanneroo Central Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade; Captain Sally Hawkins of the Wanneroo Volunteer Fire Support Brigade; Captain Brett Emerson of the Quinns Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade; and Captain Wendy Noone of the Two Rocks Bush Fire Brigade. They all responded and immediately activated their brigades, and they gave their all to keep our community safe. They did such an incredible job saving homes and property in extremely challenging circumstances. I'd also like to acknowledge and thank the new recruits, who have been training diligently throughout the year and who stepped up and fought with courage and determination. A huge shout-out and thankyou go to the brigades that came from right around

        to help support those communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to recognise the volunteers in my local community, who are inspirational. Time and time again, I've seen them step up to help one another, whether it be a neighbour or a stranger. They continuously open their hearts and their homes. I cannot begin to imagine the anguish and stress experienced by residents who have lost their property, and my heart goes out to them. My thanks go to the federal Minister for Emergency Management, the Hon.

        , who responded quickly to ensure support was available. I'd also like to thank the

         Western Australian
        </a>
        state Minister for Community Services and local state member for Wanneroo, the Hon. Sabine Winton, for all the assistance of the Department of Communities in once again supporting community members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bushfires prove how fast they can operate and how far a fire can travel and that living in suburbia does not mean you are immune from fire risk. My heartfelt thanks go to our incredible firies and to the community that has shown strength in times of adversity through their generosity and love for one another. I would also like to thank the Wanneroo Showgrounds in the city of Wanneroo for opening those showgrounds to help those fur babies and feather babies—the loved ones of others—and to make sure that they are safe and that they continue to keep safe in a good environment.
