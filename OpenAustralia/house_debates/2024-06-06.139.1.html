        I'm very happy to be on my feet today to advise that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cowan_University" rel="nofollow">
         Edith Cowan University
        </a>
        Health Centre in Yanchep is due to officially open soon. This new project is jointly funded by Edith Cowan University, the Australian federal government and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        state government. The Australian federal government will provide integrated multidisciplinary health services to meet the current and future healthcare needs of this rapidly growing northern corridor of the Pearce electorate, which is one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two parts to this project, with the health centre based over two co-located buildings. The highly anticipated Yanchep East building will be opening soon, and a new build planned for the second site will open in 2026. Contained in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECU" rel="nofollow">
         ECU
        </a>
        Health Centre Yanchep West 2023 stakeholder and community consultation report, we're advised that the mix of health services required fall into two main categories: (1) clinical based services including sonography, childhood and maternal health, cancer treatment, mental health, and chronic disease management; and (2) counselling based and social services to service gaps in Yanchep and surrounding areas in social support groups, aged-care services, home based service delivery and community health. This is highly indicative of the needs of the most northern corridor, with both its ageing population and influx of newer, younger families. Access to health services that cater for all age groups is critical given the significant population growth which is projected over the next two decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report outlined the need for additional child health services, to support the growing number of families residing in Yanchep and nearby surrounds. This includes pre- and postnatal care, development checks for infants and children, child psychology, early intervention programs to support parents and, generally, family based support programs to build resilience in children and their families. The Albanese Labor government is committed to providing urgent care clinics, cheaper medicines and accessible, affordable healthcare services, which is evidenced by our investment in the bulk-billing incentive to help free up local doctors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Cobie Rudd, from Edith Cowan University, was a driving force on this project. I know because I was also involved. I would like to acknowledge the commitment, dedication, hard work and advocacy of the whole team. My congratulations and thanks go to Edith Cowan University, who have turned this vision into a reality, and to the two final-year public health students, who each completed a 75-hour work integrated learning placement working on the 2023 consultation process. The Edith Cowan University Health Centre Yanchep is indeed a welcome initiative, and my community eagerly looks forward to the official opening. I would like to sincerely thank everybody who has been involved in this project.
