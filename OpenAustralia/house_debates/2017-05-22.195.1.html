       <p>
        Menzies: Caring for Kids, is an organisation based in Frankston in my electorate of Dunkley. Menzies: Caring for Kids    supports young people in Frankston and on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Over its more than 150-year history it has evolved many times to fulfil the needs of the community. It originally developed from the Ragged School Mission, founded in inner-city Melbourne in 1865, which provided residential care to children from 1895. In the early 1900s, the mission moved to Frankston and became known as the Minton Boys' Home. Later, the organisation underwent another name change and became The Menzies Home for Boys. The name honoured Mr. James Menzies, the father of

        , a former Prime Minister and the founder of the Liberal Party. He was the president of the committee of management for 20 years. I should note that he was originally from Jeparit, in the seat of my neighbour, the member for Mallee.

       <p>
        The core mission of Menzies: Caring for Kids is to support young people who can no longer live with their families so that they can be safe, educated and lead fulfilling lives. Rather than providing housing, they invest in direct programs that create more opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged young people in our community. I am proud to acknowledge the tremendous work that Menzies: Caring for Kids does in Dunkley and in the region and I commend them for their long service to the community.
