        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">
         Social Inclusion
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to the Colbinabbin Primary School in my electorate, which has been told that it must move one of its existing classroom blocks 3.8 metres, destroying $6,000 worth of concrete ramps, power upgrades, floor coverings and other refurbishments installed only last year as a result of local school council fundraising. This is to make way for a school hall under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
         Primary Schools
        </a>
        for the 21st Century program. Does the minister agree with the school council president, who has written, ‘There has been a very disappointing disregard for the real needs of this school, as assessed by the local school community. Such a waste of investment is very disappointing’?

         I thank the member for Murray for her question. I can certainly say to the member for Murray that I agree with the statement of one of her local principals, the principal of the Nanneella Estate Primary School, who said, ‘We’re pleased to have received enough funds to rejuvenate the school and create a modern learning area.’ I certainly agree with that statement.

            I can certainly indicate to the member for Murray my support for the 200 projects in the 101 schools in her electorate and the investment of $121 million, of course an investment that she voted against. On the specific matters that she has raised in relation to a local school, I am very happy to look at those specific matters.

               The member for Murray has raised an issue about a local school and I am making this very simple point and it is no more complicated than this: I presume that this matter is one of around 60 complaints the opposition says it has. That is a complaints’ record of 0.25 per cent, one-quarter of one per cent, for the biggest school modernisation program in the nation’s history. I will of course investigate the member for Murray’s complaint and I will respond to her directly. On the question of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">

               , 9,500 schools and more than 24,000 projects: what is clearly lacking amongst the opposition is a sense of perspective.

                     The member for O’Connor will resume his seat. Excuse me! If the member for O’Connor would first let me deal with the matter raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—and there is really no need for that sort of behaviour of slamming down that book—I simply say, in finality, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for the last time I hope for this question time, that there is no point of order. If the member for O’Connor has a point of order, he has the call.

                      and the many examples given of the need for ministers to answer questions, if belatedly, and the conventions and the precedents surrounding that practice, which of course has brought great credit to past governments.

                         I thank the member for his question and I know that he is concerned about supporting jobs in his local community during the days of a global recession. Of course,
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
                          Building the Education Revolution
                         </a>
                         is about urgently supporting jobs, small businesses and tradespeople in every community across the country during the global recession. One reason schools were chosen for this economic stimulus is that they are in every community across the country. So we are not only supporting jobs and tradespeople in the city but also supporting jobs and tradespeople in rural and regional areas. Thousands of people are having work supported to deliver these school upgrades.

                         As I have had cause to say in the House in the past, there are more than 24,000 projects at around 9,500 schools. I would like to take the House to just one and to its support for local jobs. At the Belgian Gardens State School in the member for Herbert’s electorate, the $3.2 million that has been received through the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
                          Primary Schools
                         </a>
                         for the 21st Century program and the National School Pride Program is supporting local jobs. The builder, Dickinson Constructions Pty Ltd, is hiring a range of subcontractors, providing work to local businesses including: Amalgamated Pest Control; NatSteel, Garbutt; Townsville Concrete; A Gabrielli Construction; Scott Blocks; Corradini Engineering; G James Glass and Aluminium; Colonial Sheetmetal; Best Doors; High Performance Plumbing; K and F O’Donnell Electrical, Castletown; Cleveland Trade Centre; Project Hardware, Galton; Mark Von Senden Plastering; Alec Morrossi; and

                          RST
                         </a>
                         Airconditioning. So jobs are being supported at this local school as the school engages in the biggest school modernisation program this nation has ever seen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Given that in this question time there have been questions about the state of the economy and the need for support for jobs, can I say to members opposite and to all members of the House that what this one example shows is how economic stimulus through the biggest school modernisation program in the nation’s history is supporting jobs for local people. That is supported on this side of the House. It is to be deeply regretted that those opposite cannot see their way clear to supporting local jobs.

This year, we have had over 1,000 points of order moved by those opposite, more than 200 from the Manager of Opposition Business, and I would ask you to take action against clearly frivolous points of order.

I am in no position to know the actuality of where this technical college came from, but I would assume that, in the preamble to the response, the Deputy Prime Minister was setting out the circumstances of that technical college, and I am not in a position to adjudicate. That is why an occupant of the chair is in no position to direct the response. On the point of order from the Leader of the House, these are matters for judgment by the chair. I have listened to his point but, on this occasion, I do not agree with him. The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.

                                  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked by the member for Grey about the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATC" rel="nofollow">
                                   ATC

                                  in his electorate. I am responding directly on the ATC in his electorate. His question is asking me, effectively: is that ATC closing and, consequently, is the money being spent on a facility that is closing? I could not be more relevant than (a) to explain whether or not this ATC is closing and (b) to explain what is happening with the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">

                                  On the first point, the future of the ATC he directly asked me about, which I was addressing before the point of order stopped me speaking, the future of that ATC is still under discussion and being worked on. A decision to close that ATC finally has not been taken. On the question of the Building the Education Revolution money and how it relates to the ATC I was asked about, it is dealt with under the guidelines in the same way as the way any other proposition about the possibility that a school may amalgamate or close—that is, money is not spent on that school until the question of amalgamation or closure is clear. So the answer to the member’s question is that the money is being held; it is not being spent. As the future of the ATC is still being worked through—

                                    The member for Grey will resume his seat. It is fairly disingenuous to indicate that, under the standing orders, the member is able to stand on his feet and argue a case. That is not the purpose of the point of order. To those who are brave outside this chamber in comments about conduct and who have not offered submissions about it, I simply say that they should tread carefully. We have all collectively—those of us who were not elected at the last election—allowed a situation to develop where we on different days have different opinions about what should be done, but I caution the member for Grey for following the bad habits of others. The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.
