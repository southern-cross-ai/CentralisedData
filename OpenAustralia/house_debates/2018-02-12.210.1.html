        In Longman, 27,391 people are of retirement age. These are people who have worked hard their whole lives at workplaces in the community or serving their country, and 20,688 are either pensioners who live on a fixed income or part pensioners. A significant proportion of those people of retirement age are actually our Vietnam veterans, who have served their country, are now serving in their community and quite often are still carrying the scars of the service that they provided to their country.

        Last week during question time, I welcomed shadow minister Jenny Macklin's question to Minister Dan Tehan when she asked when he planned to lower the deeming rate for part pensioners. What was his reply? The government minister replied:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … consider all options that will help Australians get a job. There are 1,100 Australians who are getting a job each day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Get a job—really? Seriously, the government's answer to lowering deeming rates is, 'Get a job'? The good people of Longman have done their fair share. The part pensioners have done their fair share of heavy lifting in this country. They pay their tax, and I suggest that this minister actually thinks about the questions asked of him in question time.
