        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. Will the minister outline how the government is supporting jobs and working Australians during this time of economic change? Is the minister aware of any threats to jobs, particularly in my glorious home state of Queensland?

         I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I can report to the member for Moreton, who I know is very interested in the creation of good jobs in Australia, that the monthly labour force figures have come out today. I can report to him that we have more Australians in full-time work than ever in the history of the Commonwealth—8.1 million people in full-time work, and I can tell—

          I am sorry that good news disappoints those opposite, but Australia has more people in full-time work than ever before in our history. What is more, since the carbon-pricing mechanism was introduced, I can report to the member for Moreton, there have been 200 jobs created every day, which casts the lie that somehow the proposals of the government are causing unemployment. However, I do have to report to the member for Moreton some disturbing trends in the monthly labour force figures, and they do in fact refer in particular to his home state of Queensland. The member for Moreton may not be aware yet that since 31 March—about the same time as

          This is a government that is committed to protecting people's entitlements. That is why today we are doing what the Queensland government and those opposite should be supporting. We are making sure that if the jobs of public sector workers throughout Australia—hardworking workers in Queensland,

We are making sure that, when a private sector worker in Australia has their business sold to another entity, they get all the same terms and conditions. We are making sure that, in spite of the second-class status which unfortunately is being visited on them by those opposite and by Campbell Newman and

             I thank the member for Moreton for his supplementary question. He is quite right: we do need consistency in workplace relations policy. We heard in my initial answer that 130 jobs a day are going when the conservatives take over Queensland. Also, I did not get the chance to tell the member for Moreton that, since
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_O'Farrell" rel="nofollow">

            <p>
             I am asked about consistency. I will tell you what, member for Moreton—when you go with the government, we mean it when we say that we will increase super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. We abolished the tax on superannuation for those on less than $37,000. What do we get from those opposite? They vote against increasing super for the worker and they vote against improving workers' entitlements, and they will reintroduce a tax on superannuation for the low-paid. I will tell you what they will also do. When it comes to chasing what they allege to be a tainted vote we see my opposite number on the shadow bench, who is happy to chase a vote they demonise as tainted when it suits their political—
