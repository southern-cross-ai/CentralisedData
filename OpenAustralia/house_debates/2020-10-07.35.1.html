        Today I want to give a massive shout-out to the mighty Western Magic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        club women's team who notched up a grand final win in the AFL Sydney Women's Division Two 2020 season on Sunday 27 September. They were amazing competitors. They won every game they played, bar one. Earlier this year, sadly, they lost a member before the season began, and club president Mark Barclay said that was a galvanising inspiration for them. As I said, they lost only one game. They powered their way to the grand final match against the team at the top of the table, St George, at

        . They were unstoppable from the start. They smashed out a 59-point win. It was a stunning result. Mallorie Jansen was named player of the match, and Zarlie Goldsworthy and Tiarne Kleyn were also acknowledged for their work. They came from a diverse range of backgrounds, from the likes of Zarlie, who is just 16, through to players like Courtney Corr, who gave birth in June and just 10 weeks later returned to the field to play a big part in the grand final. It proves mums do it all. It is a family affair, because Courtney's twin, Jaimie, also played on the team. The club president, Mark, said the competitive spirit of the team coached by Aisha Firmer was like nothing they've ever seen. Obviously, preach that, President. Congratulations to the mighty Magic!
