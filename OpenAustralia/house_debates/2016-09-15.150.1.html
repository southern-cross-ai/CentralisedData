        I am very pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to talk about a number of tremendous organisations in my local electorate that are doing great work in our community. Recently, I met with the Padstow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Fishing Club. With Steve Pomroy as president and Geoff Lapworth as secretary, the club has gone from strength to strength in recent years. It has a very active community of recreational anglers amongst its members. It was good to discuss issues of concern to the club during my recent visit to Padstow RSL, including matters such as the cleanliness of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_River" rel="nofollow">
         Georges River
        </a>
        —something I am personally very passionate about—and the issue of gross pollutant traps and their role in keeping the water clean on the Georges River. We also talked about the importance of fish-attracting devices and a number of other concerns that the club has in relation to the environment for recreational fishers in the Sydney area. Thank you very much to the club for having me to their meeting, and I look forward to future meetings in the months ahead.
       </p>

        Recently, I attended an evening at East Hills Scouts. East Hills Scouts was formed in 1956, and for the last 60 years they have been providing a great environment for local kids to learn about the scouting movement—a proud movement of a century's existence. On the night that I visited and talked to Michael Hoynes, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Leader" rel="nofollow">
         Scout Leader
        </a>
        , and some of the other leaders, it was great to see the kids getting involved in all the fun activities. We talked a little bit about government and a range of different things. It was a terrific visit to what was obviously a very tight-knit and close community. To Michael, all the other Scout leaders and all the kids who were there that evening: thank you very much for your hospitality, and I certainly hope to be able to continue to work with you in the future.

        We have a very strong baseball community in my electorate, and recently I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Archer" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Archer
        </a>
        , the President of the East Hills Baseball Club, and Jill Archer, the secretary. It is a very large baseball club which has been in existence for a long time at Kelso Park. We discussed a range of different issues. The club, of course, won the Bankstown district baseball club championship in 2015-16, which it has won many times in the past, but it is particularly good to see the club being successful this year. Like many clubs in our area, it has the support of Panania Diggers, led by its president, Gary Murray
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Panania Diggers do a tremendous job in supporting our community, particularly local sporting clubs. We have a very active sporting community, particularly in the Panania region, and I thank Panania Diggers for their ongoing support, not just of East Hills Baseball Club but of so many other sporting clubs in our community. Congratulations to everyone at East Hills Baseball Club on your great success in 2015-16.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also recently attended the annual awards presentation of the St George District Netball Association. Across the St George region of Sydney, there is a very vibrant netball community. Everyone gets together up at Rockdale, where there are a substantial number of netball courts, and all the clubs come together each weekend and play at Rockdale. That is also where the annual awards presentation was held. Thanks to Liz O'Brien, the president, and Tamlyn Holtz, the secretary, for inviting me along on the day and to all the executive members and players who were present. It was great to see a couple of clubs from my electorate recognised on the day.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Titans" rel="nofollow">
         The Titans
        </a>
        , based at Olds Park at Penshurst, is a new club but a club that has grown dramatically under the leadership of Vanessa. It was great to see the Titans there on the day. Of course, Oatley RSL Youth Club conducts activities across a wide range of sports and other pursuits, and it is terrific to see its ongoing support of youth in our area through the netball club and many other activities. So thanks again to the St George netball association. We look forward to another great year next year.
