        The men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police" rel="nofollow">

        Service are no ordinary people. They are dedicated professionals who go above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a recent ceremony in Mackay, 85 of these professionals were recognised for their service, diligence, skill, resourcefulness and professional conduct. Awards included the National Police Service Medal,

        Medal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, time does not allow me to mention them all individually, but I offer my congratulations to all the recipients. I also congratulate Sergeant David Gillies, who was awarded the

        </a>
        ; Senior Constable Damien Sledge, who was awarded the Cyclone Larry Commemorative Pin and certificate; Senior Sergeant Christine Hinds, who was awarded the Adopt-a-Cop of the Year District Award; Senior Constable Kerri Breen who was awarded

       </p>
       <p>
        Queensland Police provide a number of services, ranging from critical protection of the public and response to emergency situation to services like Blue Light and Adopt-a-Cop programs that engage with the community and make us feel safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, our police offers are not always shown the appreciation they deserve. When they clock on at the start of a shift, they do so knowing they may be abused, attacked, spat on or even killed in the line of duty while helping and protecting the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Knowing what police officers are paid, I do not know that they cop all that just for the pay cheque. They know they are providing an important service for the people and making our community safer every day. And, for that I, and my community, are truly grateful.
