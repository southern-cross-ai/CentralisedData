        It's a slightly scary thought, but Christmas is approaching at a rapid rate, which means it is time to start thinking about Christmas cards—not do anything; just think about it. This year I have once again asked the great schools of Bennelong to design a card for me. We held a competition, and a number of budding artists sent in their designs, which were of staggeringly high quality and in a range of styles.

       <p>
        Runners-up were Vicken Vartikian, from year 6 at Holy Spirit Catholic Primary School, for his cheeky little reindeer; Chansoo Joo, of year 2 at Denistone East Public School, with their colourful decorations; Alhan Odakkal, from kindy at Melrose Park Public School, for a beautiful Chinese Christmas tree; and Alexandra Ryan, of year 5 at

        , with her beautifully crafted snowman bauble. But there can be only one winner, and that went to Fiona Antonio from year 6 at Our Lady Help of Christians, Epping. Fiona's design was technical, artistic, cleverly designed and a worthy winner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Modesty prevented me from giving one card the recognition that it so deserved—a prop. Kaitlyn Fong, of year 5 at Putney Public, designed a card that featured not only my nickname but also my old racquet, which Kaitlyn recreated with perfect accuracy. The research alone that went into this card is very impressive as the racquet isn't easy to find. Congratulations to the winner and all those—
