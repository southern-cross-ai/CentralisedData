       <p>
        I've heard from many local businesses who are benefiting from our small business policies, allowing them to create more jobs for local people so they can spend less time commuting and more time with their families. In particular, our many food and beverage businesses on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        that offer unique and healthy options for local residents are really thriving as a result of our strong economy. We have many great local success stories, including Six String Brewery, Mr Goaty Gelato and Distillery Botanica, all of whom are prospering with the help of our small business tax cuts and instant asset write-offs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We can also boast about some of our amazing producers of fine food, from very small operators like Fudge Monkey at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        to larger producers such as Eastcoast Food and Beverages, a third-generation family business based as Kulnura. Food to Nourish at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Gosford" rel="nofollow">
         West Gosford
        </a>
        is another fantastic success story, producing organic, gluten-free and dairy-free products. Danielle and Natasja started in their home kitchen six years ago. They now have a warehouse at West Gosford employing 10 people from our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        By backing these businesses, increasing the instant asset write-off from $20,000 to $25,000 and lowering company taxes, we're ensuring that our tax plan encourages local businesses to grow, hire and pay their staff more. I want our Central Coast region to thrive and grow and offer even more choice and greater opportunities. That's why I'm proud of the many local businesses that boost our local economy and create more opportunities for people on the coast.
