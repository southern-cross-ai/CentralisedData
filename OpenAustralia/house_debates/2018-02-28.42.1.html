        Every Friday night the dedicated volunteers from the Belair
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS" rel="nofollow">
         CFS
        </a>
        , Blackwood CFS and Eden Hills CFS go through their training drills, update their skills and ensure they are always ready to protect our community in the event of a bushfire. A few weeks ago I was delighted to visit these CFS stations during their Friday night training session, with my state colleague Sam Duluk MP, to get a better understanding of their work and thank them for the work they do as CFS volunteers to keep our community safe. I would like to extend a special thanks to CFS group officer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Dale Thompson
        </a>
        for driving us around to the stations and allowing us to see the CFS in action.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we come to the end of another long and hot Adelaide summer, where we've regularly seen temperatures rise to 40 degrees and above, I would like to thank each and every amazing CFS volunteer who has given their time each week to be ready to protect residents, homes and businesses in our community. Our volunteers make an incredible contribution, with the Sturt CFS Group brigades responding to around 260 emergency incidents per year including bushfires, domestic fires and motor vehicle accidents. The CFS also plays an important role in educating our community by providing materials and advice to ensure we are all aware of the risks and can respond to emergencies. On behalf of the community in my electorate of Boothby, I offer my sincere thanks to each and every dedicated CFS volunteer for the work they do in keeping us all safe.
