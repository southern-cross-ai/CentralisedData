       <p>
        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the principle of cabinet solidarity outlined in the
        <i>
         Cabinet Handbook
        </i>
        , which applies to all ministers. Is the Treasurer aware of conflicting media reports of the Treasurer's loyalty, with the Treasurer reportedly doing the numbers for the Prime Minister and for the member for Dickson and for himself? Does the Treasurer retain enough confidence in the Prime Minister, the government and its policies to remain as Treasurer?

         Absolutely—the Prime Minister has always enjoyed my support. And I will tell you why, Mr Speaker. It's because together, as a team, the Prime Minister and I have ensured that we have turned the corner on debt. We're bringing the budget back into balance and, together, we've been stewarding economic policies that have seen the single greatest increase in employment on economic record in this country. We've seen young people getting the jobs. We've seen our infrastructure program hitting the ground. Our plan for a stronger economy is getting the results that we want it to get and we've retained the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
          AAA
         </a>
         credit rating under great stress and strain—one of only 10 countries to do so. And we've got plans to do even more, to ensure that Australians can continue to enjoy the prosperity and the stability that they rely on, and so that the essential services they depend on can be delivered and can be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government, the Turnbull government, has a plan for a stronger economy. The Turnbull government has a plan for a safe Australia, and we're delivering on that plan. The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party couldn't find an economic policy if their life depended on it. They've abandoned all beliefs—all beliefs!

          They interject about company taxes, Mr Speaker! We believe that taxes should be lower for all businesses. We believe it. They used to say it on the other side of the House, and they allowed themselves to be the victims of populism and walk away from orthodox economic policy. We haven't. We believe it's good for the economy. We believe that Australians who earn more should keep more. We believe that Australians who run businesses should be able to keep more of what they earn.
         </p>
         <p>
          What does the Labor Party believe, other than to put their hands deeper and deeper and deeper into the pockets of Australians and take more of their hard earned money, and for what purpose? To employ more public servants in Canberra and to spray more money all around the country; to puff their chests up at conferences and not get any results. We are a responsible government that is managing the finances of this country in a responsible way to deliver for all Australians. We've got plans to do just so much more, and we will.
