        When you hear the politics and law students at

        mercilessly drill multiple questions at the Attorney-General about the need for the new Administrative Review Tribunal, then you know that their teachers are doing a great job! Thanks go to the principal,

        When you're guided around Chidlow Primary School by student leaders Savannah and Layla, showing their confidence and pride in their school's tailored spelling program and their beautiful library, then you know that the school is in good hands. I acknowledge the great work of principal, Amanda McCormack, and her staff. And when you meet the new principal at Swan View Primary School, Jemima Tomlinson, and hear her plans to set targets for the school and for each class to aspire towards, then you know that achievement will follow.

        I visited these schools, knowing that the Albanese and the Cook Labor governments have already come to an historic agreement for funding public schools in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        to 100 per cent of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . We recognise that it shouldn't matter where you were born or the economic circumstances of your parents, because every child requires, and is entitled to, an excellent education in this country. Funding isn't the only answer to that, as evidenced by the magnificent teaching and leadership at these schools that I've just referred to, but it is part of the answer and we, the Albanese Labor government, are delivering on it.
