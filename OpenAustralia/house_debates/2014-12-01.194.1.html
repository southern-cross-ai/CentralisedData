        The third of December is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with Disability. There will be a number of events in Macarthur to celebrate this day and raise awareness of the challenges people living with a disability face each day.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbelltown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Campbelltown City Council
        </a>
        will be holding a Celebrating Ability community forum where people living with a disability, their carers and family can access information about local services and programs. The council will also be launching their Deaf and Hard of Hearing resource pack for local services.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Camden Council
        </a>
        will be celebrating this important day with a Splash Out Pool Party, and a number of local services across Macarthur will be holding morning tea with employers and community groups to meet with local job seekers.

       <p>
        I have been very privileged to be able to host a number of students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_Dei" rel="nofollow">
         Mater Dei
        </a>
        over the past four years for work experience in my office. I have also hosted a number of local young job seekers through Nova's transition to work program for work placements. I have been very impressed with the effort and support that these young people are offered and I look forward to continuing this excellent program at my electorate office. Employment opportunities are very important in ensuring that people living with a disability are included and feel accepted in our community. This is especially important for our young people as it gives them the opportunity and the tools to be independent and to live life their way. I encourage more employers across Macarthur to get involved with these fantastic programs, and I thank the many employers across the Macarthur region who are already doing so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Access to good-quality services and support is also incredibly important for people living with a disability and for their families and carers. I also thank the many community groups, organisations, individuals and employers who are creating opportunities for people living with a disability to find employment and better access services and who provide a support network and promote inclusiveness in our community.
