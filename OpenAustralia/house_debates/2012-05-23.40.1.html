       <p>
        I take this opportunity to acknowledge the positive contribution that the Wanneroo Horse and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Pony Club
        </a>
        makes in providing opportunities for young people in the Wanneroo district within the Cowan electorate. Last Sunday I visited their rally and was able to thank current and past committee members for their volunteer efforts. As we know, volunteers allow so many sports, clubs and other organisations in this country to exist. They do not do it for money; they do it because they believe that young people need the opportunities to learn good lessons and values that will make them better citizens and better community members, as well as having a lot of fun.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of the Wanneroo Horse and Pony Club, the young members are supported by the volunteers that administer, instruct and assess them. The young riders learn through these volunteers to look after and work with their horses to achieve their goals. There is no room for self-centeredness; rather, they understand the requirement for responsibility and cooperation. These are good lessons for young people to learn. Therefore I have great faith that the young people in the club will be fine Australians and make great contributions to our nation in the years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly thank their president Juanita Brewer for the chance to meet the volunteers and hear about the great Wanneroo Horse and Pony Club. I also thank vice-president Nairiee Bager and her daughter Charm for telling me about how the club operates and about Charm's Welsh C pony. I also thank the many volunteers for their great efforts to provide young riders with the opportunities to learn and compete in such a positive environment.
