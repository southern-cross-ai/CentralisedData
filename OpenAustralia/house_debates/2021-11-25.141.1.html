        As members of federal parliament we all have the great privilege of meeting incredible members of our local communities, great Australians who do so much for their community. The role of government is vital, but the role of those working in the community is equally important. That's the glue that holds everyone together on a day-to-day basis.

        There are so many people in my electorate of Casey, and so many in each of your electorates, but today I want to focus on just one, and that is Neil Gryst. I've known Neil for 20 years—the entire time I've been the member for Casey.

        veteran. After the war, he worked in a variety of jobs. He studied at night school for four years to gain some qualifications in his speciality of marketing and public relations. He is a longstanding member of my party—in fact, he was the first local Liberal member I met when I was standing for preselection 20 years ago. Above and beyond that, he is a stalwart of the Croydon

        , where he has served with great distinction, helping veterans in need over all those years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neil's history is a great Australian story, and today I wanted to place that on the parliamentary record. He's been a great member of the Liberal Party, a great member of the RSL and a great community contributor. As you'd expect, at 98 he's had a few physical health issues along the way, but his mind is as sharp as ever and his compassion is still there for his fellow veterans at the Croydon RSL. These are the people that do so much to make Australia what it is, doing so much over so many years without asking for reward or recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just felt today that Neil Gryst, who I haven't been able to see for a long period of time as a result of the restrictions we've all been facing, deserves some of that recognition—that

        generation that did so much for us so long ago, and then, after years of service, came back to Australia to build the country that we are today and to serve in so many other ways, as he's done over decades. Neil, congratulations on everything you've done, and I wanted to mention you today in the Federation Chamber of the House of Representatives.
