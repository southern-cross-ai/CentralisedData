        It is nice to be able to stay in the House to speak this afternoon. I rise to commend the new student leaders of the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        schools within the electorate of Fadden. It is no small achievement to be appointed a student leader in today’s schools. These leaders have been selected because of their potential and because of their identified abilities to make a contribution to their schools and to society going forward. Australia needs great leaders, and I am especially pleased to name some of Fadden’s up-and-coming leaders this afternoon. These leaders are 100 per cent of Australia’s future, and I look forward to hearing of their leadership journeys and future successes.

        It is a tremendous pleasure to name these new student leaders of the high schools and primary schools of Fadden for 2008. I wish them the very best in their capacity as leaders for the school year, and I look forward to following their progression in later life.
