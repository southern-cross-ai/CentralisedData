         Torres Strait
        </a>
        Light Infantry Battalion was formed in 1942, it was composed of 880 men who volunteered from across the Torres Strait, leaving only 10 men of eligible age in the outer islands. They created a cohesive battalion of men, formed into four companies—A, B, C and D. It was the only Indigenous battalion ever to be formed in Australian military history and, while Aboriginals did serve, the unit was predominantly men drawn from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islands
        </a>
        . These proud Indigenous men volunteered, many serving for almost the entire period of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . What is significant is that these soldiers were not counted in the Commonwealth census at the time, they were not entitled to vote, they were not considered citizens of the country which they chose to defend, they were not able to drink alcohol and they were paid only half the wages of non-Indigenous soldiers.

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        who enlisted on 26 September 1942, at the age of 20, was Kusal Waraka Adidi. Sergeant Waraka Adidi, service No. Q85289, was a man among men in the

         Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion
        </a>
        . At a time when the Torres Strait Islander soldiers were not promoted above the rank of Corporal, Waraka Adidi’s natural ability to lead, his presence and the respect that other soldiers showed him led to his promotion to the rank of Sergeant. He was the only Torres Strait Islander in the battalion ever to achieve that rank. Sergeant Waraka Adidi served in D Company, which was formed of soldiers from Saibai and Boigu Islands. D Company served on Goodes and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_Island" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Thursday Island
        </a>
        . Sergeant Waraka Adidi served his country with distinction for four years. He was a proud warrior of the Torres Strait, a proud Australian and a very proud Saibai Islander. His commitment to his country should never be forgotten. He was loved by all whose lives he touched. His legacy to us is the knowledge that we are certainly better people for having had the privilege of knowing him.

        On a personal note, Uncle Waraka came into my life when I was first elected as the federal member for Leichhardt in 1996. I was initially made aware of the exploits of the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion through Uncle Etti Pau. We embarked on a campaign to have members of the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion service recognised through the granting of the 1939-45 Star Medal and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Service Medal
        </a>
        1939-45. Through this campaign, and with the invaluable support of Vanessa See Kee, we successfully achieved this accomplishment 54 years after their service. Sadly, Uncle Etti Pau passed away just before the final administrative decision was made, and the medals were finally granted in 2001. As a lasting legacy, however, he did introduce me to three fine Torres Strait Islander warriors, who I collectively call ‘my generals’. These fine gentlemen, Uncle Seriako Stephen, Uncle Carolus Isua and, of course, Uncle Waraka Adidi, not only educated me in a broad range of local, cultural and social issues; they also worked tirelessly on issues relating to Torres Strait veterans. They even travelled to Townsville to complete a veterans affairs training course and then worked as volunteer veterans affairs liaison officers, based in my electorate office on Thursday Island.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Uncle Waraka was the last of my generals to pass away, and I will certainly miss him dearly. I believe that there are now only three remaining Torres Strait Islander Light Infantry battalion veterans remaining today: Jerry Stephen, Maui Gibuma and Enemarki Zaro. I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to spend time with Uncle Waraka a couple of months ago when he returned to Bamaga and I promised him that I would visit him again for Anzac Day this year. Sadly, Uncle Waraka’s time came early. He passed away peacefully on 21 February 2011. I will, however, fulfil my promise and return to the Torres Strait for Anzac Day 2011. I will take comfort in the knowledge that Uncle Waraka and my other generals, as well as Uncle Etti Pau, will be standing with me in spirit and great pride as we once again recognise and salute their service to our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to convey my condolences to Uncle Waraka’s children—John Adidi; Henry Adidi, deceased; Gillian Pearson; Wilfred Adidi; Maria Nona; George Adidi and Sam Adidi and their families, who I know are already aware of the enormous love and respect that I have for Uncle Waraka. Uncle Waraka has had a strong influence on my life, and one for which I will be forever grateful. I will never forget him and he will forever be part of my life. Koeyma esso, Uncle Waraka—which, in Western language, is ‘a big thank you’—and yawo, which of course is ‘goodbye’. Rest in peace, Uncle Waraka.
