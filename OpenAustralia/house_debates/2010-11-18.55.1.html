       <p>
        I rise in the House to, again, raise the issue of the urgent need to upgrade the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        . The dangerous stretch of highway south of Urunga has claimed another life, with the death of a 38-year-old truck driver. This follows yet another serious three-vehicle accident on the same stretch of road, in almost the same location, on the weekend. Whilst that accident did not result in a fatality, it did involve serious injury.
       </p>
       <p>
        The two-lane, undivided Pacific Highway sections are past their use by date. Dual carriageway was required years ago and people are rightly cynical about the government’s projected completion date of 2016. The state minister has come out stating that planning is underway. The planning is endless—there is endless public display and endless environmental assessment. The thing that is needed is urgent construction on the ground. It is vitally important that the pace of construction is accelerated, as well as the processes for approval and assessment, so that we can achieve a real increase in the rate of construction. People in my electorate are dying every few months, and it is absolutely unacceptable. The highway is clearly past its use by date. It is not able to carry the degree of traffic which is growing year in, year out. This matter has to be urgently attended to. The state government is not committing enough funds to this highway.
