       <p>
        It's lovely to be in the Federation Chamber talking about my electorate of Maribyrnong. It's a great part of Australia, in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. It encompasses fantastic suburbs, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonee_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Moonee Valley
        </a>
        and parts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Maribyrnong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Maribyrnong
        </a>
        , and will also, in the future, encompass Kensington,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladstone_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Gladstone Park
        </a>
        , Tullamarine and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Airport
        </a>
        . So, for every member of parliament that visits Melbourne, the first place they visit will be my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        What makes these suburbs great is not their locale but the communities within them. I just want to briefly inform members in the Federation Chamber of the fantastic grants which have been received for local community work and of the meritorious proposals. I want to congratulate the Moonee Valley Toy Library, the Moonee Valley Brass, the Essendon Hockey Club, the Maribyrnong Park sports club, the Avondale Heights Community Garden, the Moonee Ponds Bowling Club, the Trieste Social Club in Essendon, the Strathmore sports club, the Essendon Rowing Club and the Strathmore Bowls Club. I also congratulate St John Ambulance Moonee Valley, who are doing great work; the Hispano American Centre for Family Support; the 1st Milleara scouts; the

        sustainability group; the Northern Obedience Dog Club, where I was an imperfect attendee myself in previous years, training my bulldogs, who are more trainable than I am a trainer—

        </a>
        ! You would probably do better than me! I also congratulate the Strathmore Men's Shed; Farnam Street community education; Maribyrnong Park St Mary's Cricket Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Columba's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Columba's College
        </a>
        , and Ascot Vale Primary School. All of the groups I've just run through, as well as many other local community organisations, put forward tremendous and economical ideas to improve the contributions of the community and the community capital of my local electorate. From replacing toys at the toy library to music stands, hockey stands, drinking fountains and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV" rel="nofollow">
         AV
        </a>
        systems—you name it—my local community is made up of very hardworking groups and volunteers. All of the groups I mentioned put forward very meritorious proposals, which we're supporting to have their grants finalised.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wealth of a community isn't just in the value of its property. It's not just the view. It's not just the incomes of its citizens. The wealth and capital of a community is made up of its social networks. During COVID we've found that we need to rely on our local communities more than ever. We've been reminded that what makes a great community isn't just the houses or the streets; it's the people who live within them. I have tremendous respect for the volunteers and committees of these groups and all the groups in my electorate. They make Maribyrnong not the best place in the world, but a place that is not bettered anywhere else.
