       <p>
        I rise tonight to report to the House about the ongoing flood recovery in my electorate of Groom. While it has now been more than 12 months since those terrible events of 10 January 2011, during which time Toowoomba was brought into the international spotlight for the wrong reasons, the flood has left a permanent impression on our region. I am delighted to say that most of the physical recovery has been completed with the exception of a few roadworks. Homes and businesses that were gutted have been transformed, and in many cases—for example, Murray's Art and Framing and Workwear Discounts, both in the CBD—business has begun a new era, either in a rebuilt store or in a new location. However, given the scale of the January 2011 flood, it is impossible for the memories of that day ever to be erased. Certainly, businesses in the CBD have not forgotten and will not ever forget, which is why so many names appear on the petition which I have brought with me to this House tonight. It calls for a proper investment in flood mitigation in the Toowoomba CBD. More than 7,000 names appear on this petition, making it one of the largest petitions ever given to me as a federal member. I would suspect it is also one of the largest petitions presented in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of my colleagues will recall another substantial petition I presented to the House on behalf of the people of my electorate—the petition calling for the Labor government to match the coalition's commitment to build the Toowoomba bypass. On that petition there were some 26,000 names. When the people of Toowoomba recognise a need in their community they get behind it in name and in deed. The sheer weight of numbers makes the case argued in this flood mitigation petition compelling.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must take this opportunity to recognise the hard work of local businessman Bernie Baz of Workwear Discounts, who has been the driving force behind this petition. The people of Toowoomba are resilient and hardworking and have kept their good humour, even in the wake of this flood. I draw the attention of the House to the
        <i>
         Chronicle
        </i>
        of Toowoomba which, today, Tuesday 20 March, shows a picture of Bernie Baz and highlights the resilience of the people of Toowoomba. Bernie not only had his business completely flooded out and had a short fight with insurance companies until I sorted that out for him, but his business has actually bounced back. He is now selling more discount work wear than ever before. In fact, sales are up in some months on a year-on-year basis by 50 per cent. Bernie is talking about opening a business in Ipswich, which shows that every cloud has a silver lining. Bernie was not going to lie down and be beaten by the flood. He bounced back up and he has made his business even stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Toowoomba, as I say, are of that stock, and they deserve that their views be heard and acted upon. The Gillard government has imposed a flood tax on all Australians. I know some people in my electorate are paying that tax despite also being affected by the flood. The fact that they did not take time off work, the fact that they fought their way back into their homes and the fact that they do not ever want to rely on the taxpayer meant that they simply got on with it, just as Bernie Baz did. This government must ensure that it distributes the money collected from this tax appropriately. It must not just go into the general coffers of a high-taxing, high-spending, wasteful government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Toowoomba are calling for an investment into flood mitigation in the CBD in Toowoomba. I remind the House that it is the CBD of Toowoomba where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         East Creek
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         West Creek
        </a>
        met. You saw those graphic photos of furniture floating down the street and those incredible pictures of the fast-water rescue teams rescuing people who were clinging to light poles and trees. At the end of the event, fortunately, though tragically, we only lost two lives in Toowoomba as a result of the flood. That flood must not happen again in Toowoomba. We need to spend the money to build the retention basins and to clear the creeks so they flow freely and the flooding in the CBD is not repeated. The government must now work to uphold its end of the bargain. I notice that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

        in Queensland, if elected on Saturday, have committed to flood mitigation works in Toowoomba.
       </p>
       <p>
        The SPEAKER: Before the honourable member resumes his seat, does he wish to seek to present the petition?
       </p>
       <p>
        I do seek to present the petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        The SPEAKER: The document will be forwarded to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders.
