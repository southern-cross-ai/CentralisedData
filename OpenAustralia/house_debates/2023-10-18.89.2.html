        My question is to the Prime Minister. Is it the Prime Minister's position that he doesn't know if he personally supports makarrata, treaty and truth-telling until he speaks with the Referendum Working Group?

         <p>
          I note that, in the lead-up to the referendum that was held on Saturday—in which Australians, under our system, determined what their view was on the referendum question that was put for constitutional recognition of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
           First Australians
          </a>
          through a voice to parliament as the result of the invitation that was expressed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017—they said that the government was distracted. I pointed out in the lead-up to that that they'd asked every question in parliament about that and nothing about the cost of living.

            Mr Speaker, I seek your ruling in relation to relevance. This is a very tight question. It asked the Prime Minister whether he personally knows what he thinks without having to consult others.

             Order! Resume your seat. The question asked, really, for an expression of opinion, but it also mentioned the referendum and the referendum committee. Whilst the question is within order, it should really relate to government policy, not opinion, but I'm allowing the question and I'll allow the Prime Minister to continue.

             <p>
              Once again, what we see from the nature of this question is that it suggests that opinions should happen in a vacuum. What we campaigned for, I said very clearly, was to listen to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
               First Australians
              </a>
              about matters that affect them. If those opposite think that we should not listen to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
               Indigenous Australians
              </a>
              about matters that affect them at all, then they should say so. Of course, we know that that is the case. This is an absolute demonstration once again that the Leader of the Opposition has nothing positive to offer the country. He is all about saying no and opposing change. Yesterday, of course, we saw him change his position between
              <i>
               Sunrise
              </i>
              and the
              <i>
               Today
              </i>
              show. It's been on and off again. Of course, when it comes to the issue of Indigenous affairs, which is certainly relevant, we know that the Leader of the Opposition found the apology to stolen generations so objectionable that he walked out. He couldn't even stay seated there. Of all the 151 members in this House, there's only one person who walked out, and he sits in the Leader of the Opposition's chair.
