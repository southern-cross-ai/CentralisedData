        My question is for the Minister for Justice. Minister, will you update the House on the government's actions to keep Australians safe and secure from terrorism.

         I thank the chief government whip for that questionâ€”a man who knows a thing or two about what it takes to keep Australia safe and secure. Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies continue to work extremely hard and cooperatively to make sure that Australians are secure and safe from the threat of terrorism. This effort starts on home soil and is led by our joint counter-terrorism teams, which are located in each and every Australian capital city. These teams bring together the

         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and state law enforcement agencies to work side by side in each of the jurisdictions. Whilst we are never happy when these terms are called into action more frequently, the government is very confident that the arrangements we have in place work effectively in preventing and detecting terrorism threats. The joint counter-terrorism teams recently led Australia's largest-ever counter-terrorism raids conducted in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and also in Queensland and Victoria last month. I commend them on their continued hard and effective work.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am happy to inform the House that last week the Brisbane joint counter-terrorism team late additional charges against a 22-year-old Brisbane man arrested as a result of the Brisbane raids codenamed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bolton" rel="nofollow">
          Operation Bolton
         </a>
         . This man now faces a total of seven charges. The additional charges relate to preparing for a terrorist act and for possessing machetes, knives, balaclavas, military fatigues, fuel and a firearm in preparation to commit that act. In Australia, if you are found guilty of preparing for a terrorist act, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. The additional charges come as a result of the ongoing investigations into this man's activities including his alleged preparations to go and fight in Syria.
        </p>
        <p>
         The escalating security crisis in Iraq and Syria poses an increasing threat to Australia. Over 60 Australians are believed to be on the ground fighting in Syria and Iraq and approximately 100 are providing funding or facilitation. The number of Australians with hands-on terrorist training and experience is now several times what it has been when Australia has faced similar situations in the conflicts in Afghanistan. And, subsequently, the challenge in addressing this threat of returned foreign fighters and violent extremists is significantly harder.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that countering the threat of terrorism requires a combined national and international response. As well as working cooperatively domestically with states and territories, we continue to work cooperatively with our international partners. This is one of the reasons we have provided an additional $630 million for our law enforcement and security agencies and we will continue to make sure they have the resources, the technical skills and the legislative backing to keep Australia safe.
