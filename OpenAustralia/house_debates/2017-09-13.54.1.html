       <p>
        Finally we get the truth from the other side. Finally we've found out there were 20,000 inaccurate letters sent out by in robo-debt debacle. We have found out that 7,456 people owed absolutely no money. We have found out that 12,524 people actually had their debts reduced. What a monumental mistake from a government that does not care about equality. What a monumental mistake from a government that is careless about people's futures and careless about how people feel.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to the members for Robertson, Groom and Dawson: your electorates suffered the worst from this big stuff-up by this government. We have found out also that the people who have been accused either did not owe money or owed less than they were accused of owing. Who knows how many people back paid the money without it registering? Who knows? None of us does.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government and this minister should either resign or apologise. Stand up and admit the truth. You are an outrage. It is not funny. People's lives were disrupted, people's lives were hurt and some people will never recover. You are an outrage. You should be disgusted and you are disgusting. That's all I've got to say.
