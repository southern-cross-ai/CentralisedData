       <p>
        I'd like to thank the many hundreds of Fraser residents who gave up so much time to campaign for a 'yes' vote in the Voice referendum. While, as a nation and even as a state, we did not get the result that we wanted, I know that the team in Fraser gave it their absolute best. Of course, I respect the result of the referendum; at the same time, I want to acknowledge the incredibly hard work of those who gave their time, their passion and their commitment to the 'yes' campaign in Fraser and more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that Fraser is one of the most diverse electorate is, the Fraser for Yes group left nothing to chance. Jenny and Tegan worked endless weekends and nights, building and organising a dedicated community of volunteers and leading a large number of events. They were well supported by My, who ensured the group had appropriate cultural messaging, particularly for our very large Vietnamese community, and who played a key role in getting the message out to our diverse communities. The Fraser for Yes group had over 500 registered volunteers, with 240 people registering to help on polling day alone. Volunteers spent months doorknocking, eventually speaking to more than 10,000 households. They ran 33 stalls and events at train stations, and ensured a presence all day, every day, for the two weeks of pre-polling and on the big day itself. I would particularly like to thank Julianne, Julie and all the other volunteers—too many to name individually—who went so far above and beyond the call of duty. They stood at train stations, market stalls and pre-polls; door knocked; and of course undertook the role of booth captains through good weather and bad. In the case of Melbourne, that's usually multiple times on the same day!
       </p>
       <p>
        The strong sense of community was particularly apparent on the Sunday before polling day, when 400 people turned up for a final, massive doorknocking session in Canley and surrounding suburbs. Around half the people at this event had never doorknocked before. This event was a remarkable reflection of how many people across the community were energised to participate in a political event for the first time. The volunteers set up a social media group to share ideas, arrange lifts and organise events that encompassed the whole electorate. On polling day it was wonderful to see so many teenagers handing out information, possibly their first experience of political action and, hopefully, not their last. Deep friendships were formed throughout the campaign, and the strong majority 'yes' vote in some of our most culturally diverse suburbs was inspiring. Thank you again to all the individuals involved in the Fraser for Yes campaign.

        While on the subject of strong communities, I would also like to pay tribute to

        stjustice, a community legal centre that operates in Fraser and more broadly across Melbourne's west. Its team of lawyers, financial counsellors, advocates and social and community development workers is constantly advocating for the most vulnerable in our community. In addition, WEstjustice has a long history of innovative and rigorous policy work. WEstjustice works across four key areas in my community: culturally and linguistically diverse communities; people experiencing gender based violence; people experiencing economic injustice; and young people. When they see a concerning trend, they so often devise a program that can provide more systematic and targeted support while advocating to government to tackle the root cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take their Mortgage Stress Victoria project as an example. This began as a pilot in 2016. Hundreds of people remain in their homes thanks to the wraparound support provided by the team which provides this program. The success of the program helped to secure ongoing government funding and means that people in mortgage stress throughout Victoria can now access support. Then there is the School Lawyer program, a pilot project launched in 2015 and which is now in four schools in the western suburbs and has expanded across the state and the country. Young people often have no idea of their rights or where to go for support when they experience wage theft, family violence or homelessness—or get caught up in minor criminal matters, for example. But the earlier people seek help then the easier it is to resolve legal issues. This is what community legal centres do best.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another unique offering from WEstjustice is the Migrant and Refugee Workers Legal Service. High levels of worker exploitation were identified, and lawyers supported more than 200 people to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid entitlements and financial compensation for unlawful sackings. With a recent report showing that one in six migrants are paid less than the national minimum wage, the support provided by this program remains vital. Congratulations to the WEstjustice team for the hard work you do and your ongoing dedication.
