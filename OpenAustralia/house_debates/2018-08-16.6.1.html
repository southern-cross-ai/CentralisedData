        200 Tranche 2 Battlefield Communications Systems Facilities project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to construct and refurbish facilities to support the training requirements for the battle management systems being introduced under the Land 200 Tranche 2 capability which will modernise the command and control of the joint land force. The
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        identifies the importance of providing defence with enhanced situational awareness and decision-making superiority. This project will ensure that the land force can achieve these functions by providing the soldier, the heart of land force capability, with a leading-edge digital communications capability. This project will enable the land force to achieve an unparalleled level of networking across the battle space.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers and provide opportunities for small and medium enterprises through construction trade packages. The estimated cost of the project is $24.3 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This includes management and design fees, construction costs, information and communications technology, furniture, fittings, equipment, contingencies and a provision for escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2019 and be completed by late 2019. I commend the motion to the House.

        . The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's work in the cotton industry is world leading, with the organisation responsible for delivering new cotton varieties and researching crop management strategies for delivery to the Australian industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cotton industry is the largest natural fibre industry in Australia, with strong demand from overseas markets. The works proposed will resolve work health and safety issues, increase productivity and allow the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to undertake research to assist the Australian agricultural industry to be sustainable, productive and profitable.
       </p>
       <p>
