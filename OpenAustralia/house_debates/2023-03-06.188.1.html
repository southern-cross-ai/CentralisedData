         General Assembly
        </a>
        of the United Nations, which also condemned, deplored, and expressed grave concern over attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure, and reiterates its demand that Russia withdraw from Ukraine's recognised sovereign territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have moved this motion. Friday the 24th marked one year since the full-scale unlawful invasion of the Ukraine by Russia. On that day the lives of 40 million Ukrainians changed forever. The invasion has resulted in a toll of destruction, many thousands of human casualties and the displacement of over 14 million Ukrainians. Ukrainian families were torn apart as they were forced to make the difficult decision whether to stay or to go.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that day the world order changed as well. Suddenly there was a war in Europe, a war that could spread to other territories, a war that threatens to escalate and threatens democratic values, and a war that impacts on the availability of basic essentials for people around the world. On 24 February the world became more dangerous and precarious for everyone. The stability that we had come to take for granted over the years was over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, through all the ways this war has impacted people in countries around the world, it is the Ukrainian people who are truly suffering. I say to the people of Ukraine: 'Our thoughts and our prayers are with you.' I commend their strength, courage and resilience in the face of this aggression. We will continue to support the people of Ukraine. We will continue to support them and stand with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia's invasion of Ukraine was an unprovoked attack. It was in blatant disregard for the intention of the rule of law and it is a direct violation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Charter, which protects everyone's sovereignty. We must continue to speak loudly and clearly against such acts. This invasion continues a pattern of illegal and immoral aggression against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Australia continues to stand with Ukraine against Russian aggression.
       </p>
       <p>
        This immoral and illegal invasion is something that the whole of the Australian parliament stands in unity against. I was proud to stand with my parliamentary colleagues and the members of the opposition—everyone in the chamber—in the House of Representatives in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. We have provided Ukraine with military and humanitarian support, as well as refuge for displaced people, and will continue to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 24 February this year, one year since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the government reaffirmed its support for the people of Ukraine. We announced additional support in the form of uncrewed aerial systems, or drones. In February, 200 Ukrainian soldiers graduated from the Australian based training that's occurring in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        under Operation Kudu. I want to take the opportunity to thank the Australian armed forces for the vital role that they have played and are playing. We also announced additional sanctions against a further 90 people and organisations who are involved in the Russian war machine. Our sanctions have hit more than 1,000 parties, and we will continue to act in coalition with other democratic forces around the world to impose these sanctions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This war is causing damage not just to the people of Ukraine but also to the Russian soldiers and to the people of Russia, who have no idea of what the future holds. This is especially so for the soldiers who are being sent to the front line. This war will only result in death and destruction on both sides. The people of Ukraine, led by President Zelenskyy, have shown incredible resolve during what they've been through in the last 12 months. It's taken incredible resolve and courage to withstand an invasion by a much larger and more powerful country.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this has come with enormous sacrifice, of course. In the face of this sacrifice and the constant pressure from air raids, attack and atrocities committed by the invading forces in Ukraine, the Ukrainian people have stood tall. Not only are the Ukrainian people fighting for their country and their sovereignty and protecting themselves; they are also fighting for every person and country who cares about democratic values, the rule of law and the rule of international law. That's why we here in Australia, in this parliament and in this place will continue to stand with the people and government of Ukraine.

           I commend the member for Adelaide for his fine words. On this issue, all of us stand as one. What is happening in the Ukraine is beyond despicable. It's beyond deplorable. It is absolutely devastating, and all of us know and agree that Russia should immediately cease its hostilities and withdraw from all Ukrainian territory. That is the only way that this abhorrent war can be brought to an end. I'm sure all of us call on Russia and, in particular,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Putin" rel="nofollow">
            President Putin
           </a>
           , to cease, withdraw and take the responsible action that he needs to take at this time, because the suffering is too great. Not only are we seeing suffering in Ukraine; as a consequence, we're also seeing it in Russia as well, through the loss of life of Russian soldiers and the harm that it's doing to the Russian economy and to the very fabric of Russian society. So there is very good self-interest for Putin himself to act in the morally, ethically and responsible way.
          </p>
          <p>
           To the people of Ukraine: our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to you for what you are bearing at the moment. All of us in this parliament and right across our nation stand with you in the bravery and extraordinary courage that you have shown in tackling the current war that you are fighting. I think all of us have been absolutely taken to a place we never thought we could be taken to when it comes to such courage and when it comes to an extraordinary ability to defend one's sovereignty, to defend one's liberty, in a way we often wondered we all had in us. But the Ukrainians have shown that they have it in them, and the way they have fought has been nothing but inspirational.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many of us were worried that the war could have been over in one week or two weeks, but the way the Ukrainians have fought has been quite remarkable. But it is not over. As we've read recently, just in the last couple of days Russian forces are continuing to advance in some territories in the Ukraine. That is why the rest of the world has to stand with Ukraine in its fight. We have to make sure that we continue to provide military aid. Australia has gone beyond what most countries have and I think it's time all countries stepped up and followed our lead, led by the immediate response by the Morrison government, followed by the response we've seen from the Albanese government. We have to ensure that the rest of the world continues to provide that military aid and, in particular, military hardware to enable the Ukrainians to respond, and respond in a way that will see the Russians defeated.
          </p>
          <p>
           We've also got to make sure we continue to look after the Ukrainian people. We've done that here in Australia. We've taken thousands of Ukrainians and given them the option to spend some time here, to settle here, while the war continues. We've got to make sure we continue to provide that sanctuary for the Ukrainian people while they deal with this abhorrent war with Russia.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
            Can I
           </a>
           end by acknowledging the contribution that has been made by the Ukrainian ambassador here in Australia and also by the leaders of the Ukrainian community here in Australia. Vasyl and Stefan have done an extraordinary job in rallying the Ukrainian people here in Australia and making sure their interests are incredibly well represented. I had the great honour of going to the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in Melbourne to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the war starting, and to see the Ukrainian community still with that strong spirit, of the need to make sure they defeat this adversary and protect their sovereignty, was extraordinarily special.

           <p>
            The anniversary of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine was a sad realisation that many had made in recent times: it's difficult to believe this war began just over a year ago. For some of us, this realisation occurred upon the visit by Ukraine's ambassador to Australia to this building just a few weeks ago. It certainly would not feel like yesterday to him. It certainly doesn't feel like yesterday to the thousands of brave men and women fighting against the Russian troops across their home soil. It certainly does not feel like just yesterday to the thousands of Ukrainian Australians, many with family who have come under harm's way or have, like millions of Ukrainians, become displaced by this senseless war of aggression.
           </p>
           <p>
            The day was spent in many ways across this country, from a vigil held on the steps of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
             Parliament House
            </a>
            in my home state of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            to protests in front of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Embassy" rel="nofollow">
             Russian Embassy
            </a>
            right here in Canberra. Some may say that Russia would take little notice of such things, but we cannot sit idly by and let the world see, or let Russia see, that day pass without any reaction on our part. We must maintain this vigil with our words and with our actions until peace is restored again to the region. Without such vigilance, we play right into the hands of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" rel="nofollow">
             Vladimir Putin
            </a>
            . I am sure he is banking on the West to have a short attention span or an empathy deficit due to the conflict being far enough away to be merely a spectator sport. We cannot allow this to happen. This is why we stand up in places like this, the parliament of our nation, in order to amplify and deliver messages such as this.
           </p>

            colleague the member for Adelaide for moving this motion today. It gives me the opportunity to speak out in support of Ukraine, in support of our local Ukrainian diaspora and in support of scores of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Australians" rel="nofollow">
             Russian Australians
            </a>
            out there who are equally as horrified by the actions of Putin and of the Russian government. It gives me the opportunity to speak in support of the hopes of all of us for the restoration of peace and the return of Ukraine's sovereign territory so they can take care of their wounded and rebuild the many shattered cities and critical infrastructure across ever-changing front lines over the course of this conflict.
           </p>
           <p>
            The admonishment of Vladimir Putin and Russia's government is not admonishment of Russia's people. After all, we're not all tarred and feathered by the actions of our governments, whether those actions are policy failures or, in this case, vaulting well over the bar of what we would define as an atrocity and an affront to peace and decency.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Australia we can all speak up and speak out on the decisions made by our governments and elected officials. But, as we know, this is not the case everywhere in the world. It is certainly not the case in Russia. Speaking out against Putin, the Kremlin or other senior government officials often puts one in as much peril as the soldiers on the front line. Many have attempted to escape, but Putin has made it difficult to evade his wrath. Though, for many deaths, what exactly happened remains inconclusive—or who was ultimately responsible—it is a common theme that speaking out against Putin is a very dangerous endeavour.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia's place in the world is that of a peacekeeper. We were a founding member of the United Nations after its establishment at the conclusion of World War
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
             II
            </a>
            . We, along with 50 other nations, ratified the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             Charter of the United Nations
            </a>
            . We were the first president of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
             United Nations Security Council
            </a>
            , all the way back in 1946, back in the days when the West and the East joined together to stamp out evil and to stamp out the hubris of petty despots and tyrants. But, though peacekeepers we may be, we play our part well and in lock step with the rest of the free world in this ever-changing global paradigm. Dr Geoff Raby put it quite well in

I stand with the Ukrainian people. We cannot give up or halt our efforts until peace exists. Slava Ukraini.

             One year on from the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the toll on the world stands very, very high. It's appropriate that this parliament mark solemnly the deaths of 7,000 people that we know of, the displacement of 14 million people in Ukraine and a world torn apart by the consequences of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" rel="nofollow">
              Vladimir Putin
             </a>
             's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Australia, of course, as a nation dedicated to individual freedoms, human rights and individual rights, stands very firmly with our allies in Europe and around the world to stand up for Ukraine, the citizens that are fighting this war and the people that have banded together to stand up to this great evil. It's a situation that we've seen on repeat in recent years, and there's an investment that we have made as a country far away, on the other side of the world, in a people who are fighting for their liberty and fighting for their basic individual and human rights.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vladimir Putin, in recent times, has been responsible for atrocities around the world. Whether it started in Chechnya, in Syria, in Georgia, in Ossetia, in Crimea or, now, in Ukraine, the pattern is clear. The tyrant that is Vladimir Putin has publicly stated that he intends to re-establish the Soviet empire, an empire that was responsible for the deaths of 60 million people. He seems to think that that is a worthy objective, and he has certainly made a good fist of it with that horrible list of atrocities through all of those countries, and his wrecking ball that he is now applying to Europe and to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it's only right that Australia is sending our military aid. There's $655 million in total aid, but $475 million in military assistance—with of course our humanitarian aid and compassion—to aid the Ukraine people in their defence. It has allowed Ukraine to recapture 54 per cent of the territory that Russia initially seized. Given the awful surprise attack and the overwhelming odds against the Ukrainian people, this is a stunning achievement, but it's been bought at the cost of the lives of several thousand people already and 14 million people without a home.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the beginning of this conflict we welcomed here people from Ukraine, and we continue to welcome those who need safe harbour, who need temporary protection and who need to flee. Of course, people who have come from Ukraine want to return to a safe and secure country that is protected from Russia, so we continue to support the effort—the war that is being waged—on behalf of free peoples all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             I commend very much our partners in Europe for the leadership they've shown. In recent times, Europe has faced economic strife, social strife and a refugee crisis that is the greatest displacement of people that we've seen in Europe since World War
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
              II
             </a>
             . At every turn, Vladimir Putin has sought not to be a good partner or friend to the countries of Europe but to take advantage of each of these crises, whether it be through economic unrest, with his unconscionable actions in cutting off power and controlling the power supply through the gas to Europe; whether it be through his deliberate manipulation of refugees and the greatest refugee crisis since
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
              World War II
             </a>
             in Europe; or whether it be through his illegal invasions and activities in countries in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
              Middle East
             </a>
             and throughout Europe. When we think about our partners and friends in this regard—the countries of Poland, Lithuania, Romania and Hungary—we remember that migrants from these great countries came to Australia after World War II, fleeing a great evil in Europe, and established homes here and built communities. Many of us are here because of that great evil. Many Ukrainians will come here again, and we welcome them.
            </p>
            <p>
             One year on, we must not give up on the people of Ukraine or the nation that Ukraine has shown itself to be, forging itself in the fire of an illegal invasion led by a hideous despot—a new tyrant of our age and one of the world's worst dictators, who has no regard for individual rights, human rights or human life. The people of Ukraine are fighting a war for freedom in the world today. They're fighting a war for their families, they're fighting a war for Europe and they're doing so at their own expense. It's right and proper that the Australian government continues to support it. It's right and proper that we have a united and bipartisan commitment to support Ukraine through this period.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that Australia, being the nation that it is with the carefree, happy-go-lucky people that we are, will never forget the downing of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MH" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             17 or the people who died from the Netherlands and from Australia. We'll never forget our citizens shot down by Russian tyranny. We'll never forget our friends in Europe. We'll never forget the people of Ukraine. One year on, we fully support everything that Ukraine is doing to defend itself and establish itself as a country of freedom in Europe.

              Friday 24 February marked one year since Russia launched its illegal and immoral full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war raging as we speak is an unlawful attack against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has now resulted, according to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
               US
              </a>
              estimates, in 200,000 dead and many injured. At least 40,000 civilians have likely died in the conflict, and 140,000 buildings have been destroyed, costing around US$350 billion. Fourteen million Ukrainians fled the country when war broke out, and seven million are internally displaced. These are mainly women.

              Charter. The images of civilian bodies lying in the streets of Bucha with their arms tied, shot after being tortured—which are clear war crimes—are too fresh in our minds for any of us to fall for that. Russia is pursuing a total war that aims at nothing less than the destruction of the national, cultural, religious and democratic institutions of the Ukrainian people.
             </p>
             <p>
              The initial Russian war aim was not what Moscow's propaganda machine parroted to its own population: a clinical intervention to de-Nazify a country led by a Jewish leader. It was not. The goal was regime change. The initial Russian war plan was to storm Kyiv, kill President Zelenskyy and install a puppet regime. This plan failed because it met with the irresistible force of the heroic and effective resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces which, frankly, stunned the world. Russia's plan also failed because it met with the awe-inspiring reaction of a genuine people's war. Within days, Ukrainian society mobilised en masse. Many young and old Ukrainians joined the armed forces and territorial defence units by the thousands, not simply because they had to but because they wanted to. Compare that, if you will, with the 700,000 young people who fled the country during mass mobilisation in Russia. Countless Ukrainian civilians also joined the war effort by flying reconnaissance drones, raising funds, and even, in the case of Ukrainian farmers, literally towing away enemy tanks.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Russians have greatly underestimated the Ukrainian people. They also dramatically underestimated the sympathy and solidarity that their resistance would kindle for Ukraine around the world. The Kiel Institute for the

              estimates that 46 countries gave the equivalent of $168 billion in financial, humanitarian and military aid from the start of the war. That's immense when you consider that Ukraine's

               When His Excellency Vasyl Myroshnychenko pitched to be Ukraine's ambassador to Australia he felt, given his background, it would be a role about commerce, economic development and trade. Building business links between his nation and ours was to be a priority for this Chevening scholar, who has a master's in sciences in politics of the world economy from the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics_and_Political_Science" rel="nofollow">

               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Mr Myroshnychenko arrived in Australia directly from the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, on 26 March 2022. Russia had invaded his homeland little more than a month earlier. As Mr Myroshnychenko told the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
                National Press Club
               </a>
               in Canberra on 24 February 2023, marking 12 months since the invasion began, his work here has been chiefly in military matters, not in enhancing trade opportunities as originally intended. In fact, he's had to be more of an arms dealer than an ambassador—so much so that he has earned the nickname 'Vasyl the Bushmaster' for his advocacy to obtain the world-renowned, Bendigo-built infantry mobility vehicle. Australia has delivered upwards of 90 Bushmasters to Ukraine, to help in the fight against Russia. Describing the Bushmaster as 'handy and hardy', Mr Myroshnychenko went even further, saying: 'It is the Anzac spirit on wheels.' He added: 'Ukraine is lucky that Australia is in our blue and gold corner.' That said, 140 other countries are also on Ukraine's side. Mr Myroshnychenko said Russia's actions were 'not only a war on Ukraine but a war on democracy'. How very true. He said Ukraine was being hit with—wait for it— 20,000 Russian bombs a day. That's about 15 every minute; you can just imagine.
              </p>
              <p>
               'The goal for Ukraine,' he told the Press Club, 'is to win in 2023, for the world's sake. It will be won by all on the side of democracy being beyond brave.' Earlier in his address, Mr Myroshnychenko said thousands of Ukrainian citizens had been killed during the 'illegal' and immoral' invasion. We've all seen those images of the maternity wards of hospitals being bombed beyond repair. This is an outrage. This is disgraceful. The world needs to unite even further, to do all we can, to help those Ukrainians.

               Ukraine is a major supplier of grain and food for countries in the

               have had a number of discussions about this. This is because of the disruption to supplies and supply chains because of the Russian invasion. 'Russia has compromised the food and energy security of so many countries,' Mr Myroshnychenko said. 'Australia has been a real mate to Ukraine, standing up to a bully.'

               . Her name is Larissa Burack. She is a beautiful human being. She continues to raise funds and awareness, through concerts. She can play the traditional Ukrainian instruments. She can sing. Her version of the Ukrainian anthem has to be heard to be believed. It makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. She has been speaking at many events about the plight of her beloved country. While she is a long, long way from home, being in Wagga Wagga, her heart is still very much with her homeland. I understand that. It must be so difficult for her. She said she believed that Ukraine would ultimately prevail, 'But we need a lot of help.' And she is right.

               for those in Ukraine. The number of people who came out, from all backgrounds, all sides of politics, young and old, was, quite frankly, astonishing—but not really, when you think about it, because Wagga Wagga is a very peace-loving community, a diverse, multicultural community, and, when our friends get the treatment that they've been receiving from Russia, we stand as one. That's Wagga Wagga did, and we'll continue to help the national efforts to help Ukraine.

                I'm pleased to speak on this motion and commend my good friend the member for Adelaide for moving it. The 24th of February marked a year since Russia launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine. This is a sombre occasion for the people of Ukraine. We mourn the incalculable losses that this country has endured. It is a scale of war we have not seen in Europe since 1945, and we're deeply saddened by the human suffering and the global crisis in food and energy security that is affecting Europe and Africa, as the previous speaker said, caused by Russia's action. We honour the unwavering resolve and strength of the Ukrainian people as they stand up to Russia's continual aggression. We're proud to stand with Ukraine as it defends its people, its territory and its sovereignty.
               </p>
               <p>
                At its core, this is an unwillingness of the Putin regime in Russia to accept the independence of Ukraine. Russia's attack on Ukraine was an attack on all countries and on the fundamental norm of territorial integrity and sovereignty. It's not new. Just under a decade ago, the aggression in Crimea was on full display and, sadly, without significant international condemnation or response.

                This has got zero, nothing, to do with democracy. It's got everything to do with a dictatorial regime that cannot understand, and cannot accept, international rules or liberal democracy. The attacks on the family and religion—this so-called defence—by

                offends me and offends people who call Christianity their faith and who believe in family values. This has got nothing to do with that. The international community must take, and has taken, collective action in relation to this. For our part, as an Australian government, we've imposed costs on Russia. We're proud of being partners in contributing to the defence, and to economic and humanitarian assistance.

                Recently, when I was in Belgium and France, meeting with politicians and people in the

                 EU
                </a>
                , it was quite clear they recognise Australia's contribution to the support—humanitarian as well as military. In addition to the Bushmasters, we have provided additional military assistance. We have provided, for example, uncrewed aerial systems to the Ukrainian government. This support has provided battlefield intelligence and surveillance and reconnaissance capability to the Ukrainian armed forces as they continue to fight against Russia. The announcement coincides with the first graduation of about 200 Australian-trained Ukrainian soldiers, as part of the

                -led multinational training effort to the Ukrainian armed forces. They leave with skills and knowledge that will save lives.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just think of the damage done to the economy. We've seen an assault. The number of bombs being dropped on the Ukrainian people is like Verdun or the Somme. They're suffering is as if they're having the battle of Kursk or Stalingrad inflicted upon them.
               </p>
               <p>
                We've joined 140 other nations to support a resolution calling for a just peace in Ukraine. A just peace involves Russia leaving Ukraine and, I think, paying reparations to the Ukrainian people for what the Russians have inflicted upon them. It's an utter disgrace. What they've done is not only unethical but also immoral. Children are being taken from their families. There are sexual assaults and the rape of women and children, and it is utterly offensive for those people who claim that they're doing it in the face of what they think is a country that's opposing them. It's not about faith; it's about war.

                 I want to thank the member for Adelaide for moving this motion. It's a motion that I support, along with all of my parliamentary colleagues. There has not been one dissenting voice in this Chamber, and that's a good thing for Ukraine, for Australia and for democracy.

                 Just over a year ago, Russia unlawfully invaded Ukraine. The decision was illegal. It was immoral. It is the invasion of another democratic state. It is, in this case, absolutely illegal, immoral and unethical. It is an assault on democracy. It's an assault on decency, brought by a man who—and I don't use this term lightly—I believe to be evil. It's right that we continue to call out

                 for his war crimes, his hate and aggression, and I'm glad to see that a bipartisan international effort on the part of the west is supporting the Ukrainian people.

                 When I was Speaker in the last parliament, it was one of my proudest days when President Zelenskyy was given the honour of addressing a joint parliamentary sitting. It's something that I believe that Australia should press for, to show the world and the people of Ukraine that Australia stands with Ukraine. I want to send a shout-out to the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia. He has done an absolutely sensational job in defending the rights of his countrymen and countrywomen. Vasyl Myroshnychenko is a remarkable human being, and he really deserves all the praise that we can give him.

                 I'm very pleased see that the Labor government has continued to provide, as a nation, the same sort of assistance to the people of Ukraine that we provided when we were in power. Currently, 70 ADF personnel are training Ukrainian armed forces in England as part of Operation Interflex. We've provided $655 million in direct support, including $475 million in military aid. Australia is the largest non-

                </p>
                <p>
                 Australia has sanctioned some 1,000 Russian oligarchs, defence members and politicians, and I'm very proud to say that every single one of the members and senators who sit in the House of Representatives and the Senate has had the same so-called honour bestowed upon them. We have been sanctioned by the Russian government, and I'm very proud to be sanctioned by the Russian government.

                 We've provided 90 Bushmasters, and I'm proud to say a local company in my electorate, Eniquest, provides the generators for those Bushmaster vehicles. At the same time, we continue to raise international pressure on Russia to do the right thing, with a coalition of 140 United Nations member states calling for a just peace.

                <p>
                 I want to also send a shout-out to a local business. Whilst it is not in my electorate, it's on the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                  Sunshine Coast
                 </a>
                 . It is the efforts of this local business which have heartened me most, and I know that they've been of encouragement to the Ukrainian-Australian population as well. From church services and vigils, protests and flash mobs to school projects and street art, Australians have shown solidarity with the people of Ukraine and with international democratic values. Just last week, an organisation called Sunshine &amp; Sons donated money from the sale of their gin to the war effort and the people of Ukraine. It's a good cause, and we stand with the people of Ukraine. Slava Ukraine!
