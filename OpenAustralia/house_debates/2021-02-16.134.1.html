        I rise today to bring awareness to an issue that is close to my heart and which affects approximately one child born in Australia each week: mitochondrial disease. This genetic disorder passed directly from a mother to her child is caused by mutations in an individual's nuclear, or mitochondrial,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
         DNA
        </a>
        . It is a devastating condition. Common symptoms include developmental delays; seizures; weakness and fatigue; muscle pain; vision and hearing loss; and multiple organ failure and heart problems, leading to mobility problems. Severe cases cause premature death.
       </p>
       <p>
        With no known cure, and very few treatment options available, parents are often told by doctors that there is nothing that can be done. They must watch their child suffer a cruel and slow death. It is every parent's worst nightmare and the grief must be unimaginable.
       </p>
       <p>
        One local constituent in Concord, Ms Toni Catton, has given me personal insight into the mito community. Toni is the general manager of the Mito Foundation, and she has played a vital role in advocating for greater awareness, research and treatment for mitochondrial disease. Like many people working for the organisation, Toni's passion to find a cure comes from personal tragedy. Her beautiful daughter Alana was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease when she was only three years old. I met Alana shortly after I was elected as the member for Reid, and I will never forget the bright, bubbly young girl who approached me with her mum while I was at a mobile office. She tragically passed away from the disease last year, only three years after being diagnosed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Toni has ensured that Alana's legacy will live on by continuing her daughter's fight against the disease that took her life too soonâ€”and that fight has not been in vain. There is an opportunity now for us to legalise mitochondrial donation here in Australia. This assisted reproductive technology can help stop a mother from transmitting mitochondrial DNA to her child. In 2015 regulations were passed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , approving mitochondrial donation to be used for human reproductive purposes to prevent mitochondrial disease. In the coming months, there will be a conscience vote when legislation to legalise the treatment is put to parliament. For those who have seen the suffering of this condition, mitochondrial donation is nothing short of a miracle. I want to assure Toni and other members of the mito community that I will be supporting the bill. It's the least I can do to support the fight against mito and honour the memory of beautiful little Alana.
