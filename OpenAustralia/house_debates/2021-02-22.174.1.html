       <p>
        It's been my honour over recent weeks to take part in leadership induction ceremonies at Loganlea and Windaroo Valley state high schools. It's always inspiring to witness these impressive young people being recognised for their willingness to step up to positions of responsibility and leadership. Loganlea State High School Principal Mr Brenton Farleigh invoked the school's motto, 'Respect, Integrity and Resilience', in his address to the school, and he reminded the students to show and receive respect through actions and words. Windaroo Valley State High School Principal Mrs Tracey Hopper said to students: 'Don't underestimate your capacity to influence others.'

        Being a positive role model isn't limited to those in leadership, and I want to pay tribute to the students who are part of the Loganlea State High School's Signature Academic Excellence program. This program was set up by Kirri Griffiths to encourage students with academic potential to stick to their studies and back themselves. Many of these students face considerable hardship. The goal of the program is to encourage them to stay at school. At the end of last year, these remarkable kids put together an e-cookbook called
        <i>
         Cooking for kindness
        </i>
        , which contains the recipes of all their favourite meals. All proceeds raised, nearly $2,000 in total, was donated to Hummingbird House, Queensland's only children's hospice. Their generous acts of service to others deserve to be widely commended, and I commend all the student leaders for their forthcoming year.
