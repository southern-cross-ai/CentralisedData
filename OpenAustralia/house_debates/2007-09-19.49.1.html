        My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House of the government’s record in supporting schools? Are there any threats to this fair funding?

         I thank the member for Bonner for his question. What a great member he has been for the seat of Bonner. In March 1996, unemployment was 6.7 per cent in Bonner; today it is 3.6 per cent. He has been a great member. He came from a small business background, and I understand that he is up against a Labor candidate who would know nothing about small business because, of course, she has been a Labor staffer—not a union member; a Labor staffer.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Howard government has provided record levels of funding for schools in every year since 1996. I repeat: there have been record levels of funding since 1996 for our schools. This year there will be around $10 billion for our schools. Funding for state government schools particularly has increased by 70 per cent in real terms, even though there has only been a one per cent increase in enrolments over that time. The facts are that 65 per cent of students in state government schools receive 75 per cent of total public funding, 35 per cent of our students attend Catholic and independent schools and those schools receive a total of 25 per cent of public funds.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order under standing order 91. The members on the other side continue to disrupt. It is hard to hear the answer to the question, with the Chief Opposition Whip walking around deliberately trying to create a diversion. I ask that you bring the other side into order.

            The Howard government believes in supporting parental choice. We do not believe in punishing parents who choose to send their children to a Catholic or independent school.
           </p>
           <p>
            The member for Bonner has asked if there are any threats to this fair support that we provide for parents. I have to tell the member for Bonner: yes, there is a threat, in the form of Labor in lock-step with the Australian education unions. Labor and the unions are ideologically opposed to funding Catholic and independent schools. When they were in government, they had a ‘no new schools’ policy, which was designed to prevent new Catholic and independent schools from being established. In opposition they had a hit list which was designed to rip money out of particular Catholic and independent schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            After decades of bias against Catholic and independent schools, all of a sudden the Leader of the Opposition pops up and says, ‘You must believe that Labor has suddenly changed. It has suddenly changed its spots.’ It has not. The unions’ unrelenting attacks on Catholic and independent schools—

                                 That was grossly offensive to the parents of the 1.1 million students who attend Catholic and independent schools in this country. The unions’ unrelenting attacks on Catholic and independent schools, as demonstrated by the advertisements that they are running, totally misleading advertisements, are also borne out by what the unions say. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into Commonwealth funding for schools, they state this:

                                 The Australian Education Union is working in lock-step with the Labor Party. Just a few weeks ago the Labor Party adopted the union position on education funding—again this year—and it is now up on their website. The Labor Party’s national platform restates the hit list formula. We know it, you know it and the public knows it. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to publish the list of schools that the Labor Party will take money away from.

                                           for 2007. Isn’t it the case that Australia has the third lowest proportion of public expenditure on education in the OECD, that Australia’s proportion of public expenditure on education is 14 per cent below the OECD average and that Australia’s proportion of public expenditure on education has declined by nearly six per cent since 1995? Why, after 11 years in office, is the government’s report card on education ‘fail, fail, fail’ and what plans will the Prime Minister now outline to the House to deal with his demonstrable failure on education policy?

I ask the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly can accumulate a few more facts about things, to bear this in mind: the OECD analysis excludes

I would have thought that was a fairly fundamental omission, and I would have thought there would be bipartisan agreement that it was a fundamental omission—not a fundamental injustice but a fundamental omission—because HECS was introduced by a Labor government in the 1980s, with the support of the opposition. The report leaves out 75 per cent of our vocational education expenditure, it leaves out our childcare subsidies which support early childhood education, and it also leaves out all new education expenditure since 2004. These facts would have been available to the Leader of the Opposition. He either knew this when he asked the question and was nonetheless prepared to mislead the parliament and the Australian people or, alternatively, he was not adequately briefed by his staff before he raised the matter in parliament. The truth is that this government’s record of supporting both public and private education is second to none not only around the world but also in the history of this country.

It was Australia’s great Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies who led the breakthrough for the first time in the history of this country, more than 40 years ago, to give direct financial assistance to Catholic and independent schools. And it will ever be to the credit of this side of politics that we have stood, through those years, shoulder to shoulder with Catholic and independent schools and shoulder to shoulder with Australian parents in their right to choose the school they want to educate their children.

There has never been any double as to where we stand in relation to low-fee independent schools.

That policy, which we introduced in 1996, was opposed by the Australian Labor Party. They tried to pass a resolution in the Senate to sink the policy and it was only with the support of Brian Harradine—and I record again my thanks to him—that we were able to get that policy through.

So I would say, in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, when it comes to economics, he has four Fs against his name—failures on all of those counts—and I can assure him we are closely counting.
