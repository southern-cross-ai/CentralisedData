       <p>
        I rise to speak about the Creek to Creek Chamber of Commerce 2011 business awards, which were recently held within my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . At a time when many businesses have been doing it tough, it is encouraging to see opportunities for business owners and their employees to get the recognition that they deserve.

        </a>
        , Tugun, Elanora, Currumbin and Tallebudgera areas. A gala dinner was held at the Currumbin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        on Thursday, 6 October and this year's winners were announced. The Currumbin RSL does an excellent job supporting the veterans in our community and is also a significant and great supporter of the local community in general. To nominate a business for these awards a detailed submission had to be completed which included 10 questions, such as: 'Has the nominated business monitored client satisfaction?' and 'Have they contributed to the broader community?' Any business, from retail through to manufacturing, could be nominated for these awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity today to congratulate the award winners: Jake Nolan, who won the Under 25 Business Achiever; Fifth Avenue Florist for the Business Achievement Award: 5 or less employees;

        for the Business Achievement Award: 30 plus employees; Second Nature Asia Pacific for the small business award; the Palm Beach Youth Music Venture for the non-profit/community organisation award; Healthy Inspirations for the product or service innovation award; and Pilates Elements for the Special Achievement Award: Business or individual. I would also like to acknowledge the businesses who sponsored these awards, including Tursa Employment and Training; Red Heeler Business Essentials; Villotti Photography; Inology; Tugun Bendigo Community Bank; Simply Smiles; and

       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank the executive committee from the Creek to Creek Chamber of Commerce for putting this recognition program in place for our local businesses. The executive committee is certainly doing a wonderful job connecting our local businesses through regular meetings, breakfasts and events such as the business awards. I commend the efforts of the President, Darren Mackintosh; the

        and Joan Farmer from the committee for their continued support of the organisation's operations. Local businesses benefit from the networking opportunities within the Creek to Creek Chamber of Commerce and I encourage their continued support, especially where recognition is given to businesses that are working hard to provide the best service to the local community.
