        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the opinion of senior counsel and former Solicitor-General, David Bennett
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        , that the coalition's approach to offshore processing:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … provides more protection for asylum seekers than the two Government versions and it is less likely to be the subject of complex judicial proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the coalition's approach would allow offshore processing to restart immediately, will she now adopt the coalition's amendment or does she disagree with David Bennett's advice?

           In answer to the member's question, given the member has served as a minister for immigration in an earlier government, he would be well aware that government turns to the Solicitor-General for legal advice. We have received legal advice, we have released it publicly, and the opposition has been briefed on it. I could take the member to many parts of the legal advice but perhaps it will suffice to take him to paragraph 3, where the Solicitor-General—and the Solicitor-General has been working with other legal advisers so obviously it is the considered opinion—says:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Our short advice is as follows. In the light of—
          </p>
          <p>
           and then he refers to the High Court case—

            Plaintiff M70

           we do not have reasonable confidence on the material with which we have been briefed that the power conferred by s 198A could currently be exercised to take asylum seekers from Australia to either Nauru or to

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question from the member for Berowra dealt with advice that was provided on the government's amendments tabled on Monday. She is reading from advice from the Solicitor-General on previous amendments.

                knows that government relies on the advice of the Solicitor-General, he nodded. That would have been his experience as a minister. It is our experience and my experience as Prime Minister, and the advice of the Solicitor-General is as I have outlined it.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is before we get very complex set of questions involving unaccompanied minors. The minister, having served as a minister for immigration, is well aware of the very complex set of legal and policy questions involving unaccompanied minors, and the High Court has had something to say about the law involving unaccompanied minors as well. And so, relying on the Solicitor-General's advice, the factual circumstance that the government finds itself in, and that all members of this parliament find themselves in, is that the legal advice available to us is that one could not commence processing offshore without incurring legal risk. The Solicitor-General has particularly pointed to legal risks also involving complex questions around unaccompanied minors. That is the legal issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government is seeking to resolve that legal issue in the national interest so this government and future governments have the kind of power in relation to offshore processing that the member had at his disposal when he was minister for immigration when he did have asylum seekers processed in a non-refugee convention country. I say to the member who has asked the question that maybe he might want to consider and advise his counterparts in the opposition how inappropriate it is for them to try to manoeuvre this parliament into the end of offshore processing by basing their argument on the refugee convention when in government their actions were not associated with refugee convention countries. There is a word for that, and it is called hypocrisy.
