       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge one of Goldstein's constituents for the significant contribution that she has made to our country: Pat Davies. In 1939 the great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Robert Menzies
        </a>
        made a faithful speech advising that it was his melancholy duty to inform Australians that this nation was at war. As a result, Pat—then just 18—was soon to see her partner at the time leave for war. Being a nurse, she was soon sent overseas to serve our country as well. Pat went to nurse at hospitals in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and then, as the war neared its conclusion, she crossed the Mediterranean and tended the casualties resulting from the Allied progress into Italy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the war, Pat married her soldier, raise a family and became a proud grandmother. At the age of 95 she is an inspiration to our community. She has given so much to her country, and her story is one that needs to be shared. Too often these stories go on untold. It is positive to look back so we can grow and learn from these inspiring people as we continue forward. I would like to thank Pat and many others in our community for serving our great country in times of war and in peace. My hope is that her story can inspire our current and future generations.
