        Behind Footscray's Community Bike Hub is a great story. For more than 10 years, volunteers have been repairing donated bikes for people in need, including refugees and asylum seekers. More than 660 bicycles have been donated, and more than 1,300 bikes have been saved from going to landfill. The bike hub and Footscray High School now deliver a Bike Academy program, whereby all year 9 students complete a two-week workshop at the hub. The program has become extremely popular. For many girls in the program, the practical experience has fostered an interest in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        subjects. Students interested in a career in the trades have gained valuable experience, and students who were at risk after the long COVID lockdowns have re-engaged with education.

        The technical skills that have been learned are valuable, but the students also learned amazing life skills: patience, persistence, learning from failure and problem-solving. The students are also responsible for signing off on their work, so they take it very seriously. Last year 320 year 9 students completed the program, and another 320 will complete it this year. A key volunteer at the hub, Tony McCulloch, says he loves being a part of something so important:

        It is amazing what the kids get up to. They look at things differently, so I often learn from what they are doing. And it is great seeing their confidence and knowledge develop. They feel such a sense of purpose.

        Thanks to all who make this program possible.
