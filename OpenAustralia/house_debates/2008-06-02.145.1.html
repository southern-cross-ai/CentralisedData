       <p>
        In 2004 I had an election commitment of $800,000 to Fernlea House palliative care in Emerald. This was a fantastic local project which had been pushed very hard by people like Jan Lancaster, who actually purchased the property for the palliative care hospice, and the former government supplied the funds. We had a review last year and, under the Howard government, supplied another $170,000. Why? Because they were punching above their weight in providing such a great service.

        But, after this year’s Labor budget, we had the amazing news that the budget cut the funding to Fernlea House palliative care. Even more disgraceful was that Fernlea House got only six weeks to ask their clients to leave—people who are in the most desperate stages of their life. This was a really disgusting decision, one I just could not believe. There has been a reprieve, and I thank Minister Justine Elliot for giving Fernlea House another 12 months. But that is still not good enough. We need to back Fernlea House; it is a fantastic cause. It is helping people in their dying days and making sure they have quality of life. This new Rudd government has really let down the people of Emerald and the entire area of

        with this palliative care issue. I call on the Rudd government to fund Fernlea House full time.
