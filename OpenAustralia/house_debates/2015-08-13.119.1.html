        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL

        ladder. In the week when we paid tribute to our fallen colleague,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Randall" rel="nofollow">
         Don Randall
        </a>
        , I would like to mention that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        were a subject that Don and I often discussed. He enjoyed going to their games and it was one of the highlights of his life. I know that he was really looking forward to the West Coast Eagles participating in the finals this year. Unfortunately, Don will not be around to see that. But, at the same time, I am sure his spirit will be hanging over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subiaco_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Subiaco Oval
        </a>
        . During those times, I had discussions with Don about the West Coast Eagles relocating to a new $65 million centre at Lathlain in my electorate. I first promoted it way back in 2010 when the new stadium was announced for my electorate, as well, at Burswood.

       <p>
        One of the things that we need to continue to fight for—and I just need to update the people of my electorate—is getting more funding for the West Coast Eagles. We will continue to do that. The beauty of the West Coast Eagles centre is that it has a lot of community-based facilities. It will have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wirrpanda" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Foundation. We all know about David Wirrpanda and his connection with West Coast, but he also does good work with Aboriginal youth in Western Australia. Also, there will be a community program facility run by the West Coast Eagles. If they move out to Lathlain they will also have a community hub that includes cafes, barbecues, playgrounds and landscaping, as well as a running track. They will also have an aquatic rehabilitation and recovery facility which, under an MoU with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        in Western Australia, will help injured soldiers who return from the warfront to recover at this particular facility. They will also have indoor football training facilities, sports science facilities and their administration facilities. The particular highlight, I guess, of the new facility will be two ovals—one the size of the new stadium at Burswood and one the exact same size as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCG" rel="nofollow">
         MCG
        </a>
        , obviously so that they can use that as a training facility for when they play in the finals. It will be a unique centre. The jewel in the crown is the medical research centre, which will be run as a partnership between

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdoch_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —a partnership which no other facility in Western Australia has had or looks like having.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the people of Swan, I am continuing to fight for the funding for this new centre of excellence and new community hub. I look forward to continuing to update them. Hopefully, we will be successful in gaining some funding from the state as well.
