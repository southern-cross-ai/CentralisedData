       <p>
        I wish to express concerns regarding the key recommendations of the Lockhart review on the prohibition of human cloning. The report was provided to the government towards the end of last year and yet we still have no response from the government on the recommendations contained in that report. The report gives the appearance of confirming a ban on human cloning. Members would recall that we as a parliament voted to install a ban on human cloning. A reading of the report would give the impression that nothing of any consequence would change in that regard if the recommendations of the report were adopted. However, in truth, the recommendations change the definition of human cloning to allow the practice of human cloning in particular circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recommendations would allow cloning of humans for research training and clinical application for a life span of up to 14 days. In effect, the report redefines a human embryo so as to allow research that at present is prohibited. If implemented, the recommendations would also allow in particular circumstances the crossing of humans and animals, the cloning of human genetic material and animal eggs, and the combining of genetic material of more than two people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parliament will move into very dangerous territory if it seeks to redefine what constitutes human life. The Lockhart review appears to do so for scientific purposes. The argument is that other countries have undertaken this research and that Australia should not be left behind in the race to do research in these areas. But on so many matters of life and death, Australia has taken a stand. Australia, for example, is an opponent of capital punishment. Australia should not allow itself to corrode ethical standards as a basis for participation in a global competition in stem cell research. That is why I express very grave concerns about the key recommendations contained in the Lockhart review.
