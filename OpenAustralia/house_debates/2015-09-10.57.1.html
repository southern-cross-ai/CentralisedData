           … the China free trade agreement will not allow unrestricted access to the Australian labour market by Chinese workers. It will not allow Australian employment laws or conditions to be undermined, and it will not allow companies to avoid paying Australian wages by using foreign workers.

          <p class="italic">
           We don't have any fears about this deal. There will not be hundreds of Chinese electricians flooding into the country. If this deal proceeds, there will be thousands more Australian jobs.

          <p>
           So, instead of fear mongering, instead of trying to make out that somehow or other this is going to hurt the Australian economy, instead of trying to defend the shameful, dishonest media campaign, the Labor Party, wanting to present itself as an alternative government—

               My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. I remind the minister that Tasmanian farmers enjoyed tremendous success at both the ABC Kondinin Group Farmer of the Year Awards and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Rural Women's Awards ceremonies held last night. How will diverse agricultural businesses in my electorate of Lyons and around Australia benefit from the export agreement with China?

               </small>
               <p>
                I thank the honourable member for his question. As someone who was born and bred in northern Tasmania, he really holds his electorate close to his heart. It is the largest electorate in Tasmania. He had incredible success in the awards last night with the Kondinin Group. In fact, I believe that Carol Bracken, from Glengarry, who was one of the runners-up last night, is with us here in the parliament today in the gallery—somewhere up next to the Mayor of Tamworth, who is also up there at the moment.
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the big issues associated with the free trade agreement is that it has shown proven success in other countries, such as
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                 New Zealand
                </a>
                . If we look at the results with respect to the products that are available in the member for Lyons' area, we see that we have proven success in the other trade agreements that we have done with Japan and Korea. Let's look, for instance, at table grapes. Since we signed the Korean free trade agreement, from January to June this year, we have moved in $2 million worth. We can also look at other successes. From January to June 2014, before we signed the Korean free trade agreement, we exported $2.3 million worth of macadamia nuts. After we signed the free trade agreement with Korea, it was $6.3 million. From January to June 2014, before we signed the free trade agreement with Japan, we exported $0.4 million worth of almonds. From January to June 2015, after we signed the free trade agreement with Japan, it was $1.6 million.
               </p>
               <p>
                No matter where we go, we can see that these free trade agreements have a real impact, a definite impact, on returns to these regional areas. A great working example of that, of course, is New Zealand, who signed a free trade agreement in 2008. Before that, their exports were worth less than a billion dollars. They went from less than a billion in 2008 to $6.7 billion in 2014. If we look at a whole range of their products, we see that they have had a substantial increase. For instance, before they signed the free trade agreement, dairy products were at $321 million a year and now they are at $4.2 billion a year.
               </p>
               <p>
                So who would be against this
