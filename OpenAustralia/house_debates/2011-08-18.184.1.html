        The contribution by the member for Cowan brings to mind the importance of bringing people to Canberra to see how our great democracy works and to understand that members of parliament come to this House to try to bring about change and make Australia a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        What has upset me enormously in recent times is the level of debate taking place within Australia. I have been involved in politics for a very long time and I am very fearful about where the vitriol that has crept into politics in recent times will end, and it is not only in politics; it is generating out into the community. A person like me who has been around for a long time can handle people being very angry and upset, but as members of parliament we have a role to show leadership and to encourage people to engage in debate in a civilised way. Unfortunately, in this country things have changed so much that the level of debate has descended to abuse and to the lowest common denominator. I am not necessarily saying that it is only within this parliament, but it happens within this parliament. I would like to think that we can raise the level of debate, show some leadership and move away from where we are at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am the greatest advocate for freedom of speech that you will ever come across. I believe that people should have the right to express their views, no matter what they are. I accept that a lot of people have views that are different from my own, and I think that is great because that is what a democracy is about. It is about people having different views and being able to express those views, but that does not mean that people can abuse, threaten, denigrate or trivialise other people. So I say that it is time now for all politicians to show a bit of leadership and get out there and lift the level of debate in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have two petitions that I wish to submit to the parliament. These are petitions that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with, but they are the thoughts of the people who signed the petitions. One petition calls for an end to live animal exports, which was sponsored to a large extent by Temple Eyre. The other petition asks for the definition of marriage to be retained as being between a man and a woman. I seek leave to table these petitions, and in doing so I encourage all in this House to lift the level of debate, stop denigrating other people and show some leadership.

         The honourable member does not need leave to present a petition, under standing order 207(b)(ii). However, my understanding is that these petitions have not yet been approved by the Petitions Committee so the receipt of the petitions will be on the basis that they are in order. If they are not in order, the honourable member will be able to return and seek to table them as a document, with the consent of other honourable members.
