        I rise today to speak on what is in store for the Bonner community in the year ahead. All across Bonner I have listened to what locals want. I am committed to delivering to them what matters most. My flagship commitment is to the

        </a>
        , one of the Bayside's most iconic institutions. The club will have their dressing sheds and gymnasium fixed, giving them and the Bayside sporting community the playing facilities that they deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other local sporting clubs that will receive vital upgrades to their facilities include the Mount Gravatt Youth and Recreation Club, the Bayside

        Karate-Do Club, Manly Bowls Club, Mount Gravatt Bowls Club, as well as the Wynnum Rugby Bugs, to help them cover the costs of installing solar power.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mount Gravatt Men's Shed will also receive funding to install a new solar

        system. I have always been proud to support local men's sheds and their important work for the community. Wynnum Manly and District Men's Shed will also receive assistance to help them install and fit-out their new home at

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Wynnum-Manly Meals on Wheels is another organisation that does a great service to the community. It will receive funding to go towards new kitchen facilities at their Kitchen and Community Centre at Wakerley. I want to thank President Ken Edwards for his hard work on this. The new centre is going to be a huge boost for Wakerley and the surrounding areas and I cannot wait to be there on opening day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other local community groups that will continue to thrive under this coalition government include Eastside Community Church, 215 Squadron
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAFC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , St Agnes Catholic Primary School and the Moreton Bay Discovery Centre. Under the coalition, Bonner will receive more support through grassroots funding of community organisations than ever before. I will continue to support my community by supporting this government's agenda to grow jobs and deliver real results for our local community.
