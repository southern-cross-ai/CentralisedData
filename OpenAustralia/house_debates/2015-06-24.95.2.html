       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the release of the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group (Advisory Group) report, 'Action Now: Classroom Ready Teachers' on 13 February 2015;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that the Advisory Group, comprised of eight educational experts, was established in 2014 to provide the best possible informed advice and guidance on how teacher education could be improved to better prepare new teachers for the classroom;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that the credentials, expertise and contribution of the Advisory Group was of world-class quality;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that the Advisory Group conducted its review with consistent impartiality, dedication and objectivity, to the benefit of all Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the critical contribution made by this report to optimising teacher development for all Australian schools of the 21st century; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the truly comprehensive and wide ranging nature of the Advisory Group's investigation and subsequent report;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) this report is both far ranging and innovative and includes a total of 38 key recommendations;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the recommendations have at their core a central unifying element and thread—the educational interests of children, first, foremost and always;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) current and new teachers should also welcome this report, which will further enable and support both individual teachers and school communities as a whole, in both the foreseeable future, and over the longer term;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) overall, this report will affect constructively the lives of a majority of Australians, including most particularly teachers, parents and students;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the impact of this report will be impartial in nature, being blind to both the demographic and economic circumstances of teachers, parents and students, alike;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) this report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) is underpinned by both balance and merit, for example, it readily acknowledges the existence of both current high performing teacher performance and contribution, as well as identifying the need and scope for other performance to be significantly improved, together with a range of mechanisms and strategies to achieve this key objective; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) will act to further affirm the significance and centrality of school education within Australian society;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) by improving overall teacher performance, this report will likely support the retention of more students at school for longer, including most desirably, the completion of Year 12 by as many students as possible; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) this report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) will exert a long term and positive impact on current and future Australian workplaces and work performance; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) signals the intended ongoing future emphasis which the Government will continue to give to education and education related matters, for the benefit of all Australians, in an increasingly competitive region and world; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Parliament to endorse the Government's strong response to implementing this report as both a key milestone and critical policy initiative in shaping Australian school education and performance (for both teachers and students) for the early 2lst century.
