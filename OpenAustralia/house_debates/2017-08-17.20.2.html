        activities. The scope of works includes a new multi-purpose building for office accommodation, classrooms and living-in accommodation. The engineering requirements include the extension of a council road, a new entry gate, a new boat ramp, internal road network, security fencing and connection to potable water, sewerage, stormwater and electrical services.

       <p>
        The Public Works Committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for, once again, undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in November 2017 and be completed by February 2019. With that, I commend the motion to the House.

        155—Enhanced Gap Crossing Capability Facilities Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to build new and upgraded facilities to support the sustainment and maintenance of and training in the enhanced gap crossing capability at four locations across Australia. The project will deliver facilities and infrastructure at Wallangarra, Townsville in Queensland—I note the presence of the member for Herbert in the chamber—Darwin in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
