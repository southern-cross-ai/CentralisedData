        Community organisations are the heart and soul of our community in Holt. Across the suburbs of Cranbourne, Clyde, Botanic Ridge,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Park" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        South, Pearcedale, Tooradin and Warneet, these organisations embody the principles of compassion, service and unity that are crucial for a thriving community. In Holt we are fortunate to have such organisations that not only provide essential support and services but also foster a sense of belonging and togetherness. Their work ensures that no-one is left behind and that every individual has the opportunity to contribute and thrive.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today with immense pride and gratitude to share the remarkable success of the Holt community spirit and leadership awards night, an event that celebrated the extraordinary contributions of 70 exceptional individuals within our community. These leaders have shown unmatched dedication in areas such as multiculturalism, sports, the environment, community services and many other fields, making Holt a beacon of community spirit. The 70 community leaders honoured at the event have demonstrated outstanding commitment to their respective fields, and their stories are truly inspiring.
       </p>
       <p>
        We celebrated those who have enriched Holt's multicultural fabric. Our community is a vibrant mix of different cultures, languages and traditions, and our multicultural leaders have played a crucial role in promoting understanding, respect and harmony. Forty-five per cent of people in my electorate do not speak English at home, and Holt contains residents from nearly every country on earth. Leaders in Holt have recognised cultural festivals, provided language classes and offered support services to new migrants, ensuring that everyone feels welcomed.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the night we highlighted the significant role of community broadcasting in Holt, exemplified by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAA" rel="nofollow">
         MAA
        </a>
        TV and Casey Radio. These platforms, run by volunteers out of passion, provide vital communication channels that connect our community, offering a voice to diverse cultural groups, local artists and community initiatives.

        population, promoting understanding and inclusion. Meanwhile, Casey Radio serves as a cornerstone of a local news, sports and entertainment. Through their dedicated efforts, these broadcasters ensure that the stories, achievements and concerns of our community are heard and celebrated, strengthening the social fabric of Holt.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was proud to thank the work of volunteers at the Warneet-Blind Bight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        and recognise the amazing contributions from CFAs across Holt, including at Hampton Park, Narre Warren, Clyde,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Meadows" rel="nofollow">
         Devon Meadows
        </a>
        and Tooradin. The CFA volunteers put their lives on the line to protect our community from the devastating impacts of fires and other emergencies. Whether responding to bushfires or educating the community about fire safety, their contributions are invaluable.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, we recognise our sporting leaders for their contributions to building community connections across cultures. These leaders have inspired countless individuals, particularly the youth, to lead active and healthy lifestyles. Through their dedication, they have nurtured talent and instilled important life skills such as teamwork, discipline and perseverance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the leaders promoting environmental stewardship in our community. Their efforts, from planting new trees to rescuing animals in need, are essential to preserving the natural beauty and biodiversity in Holt.
       </p>
       <p>
        These leaders have a profound impact on our community and have guided me personally through my journey as a federal MP. I wouldn't be here without the support of each and every one of them. Let us take inspiration from these remarkable people and pledge to support and celebrate the community spirit that makes our nation so strong and so great. To all those community leaders, once again, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you, because without you I cannot do this job.
