        region in Brisbane on Saturday morning—I was up at about 5 am, running around in my dressing gown, trying to stop some localised flooding!—and I thought the event may be rained out, but it was a very successful event. By one o'clock, all the showers had cleared and there were many local people who came down.

        I thank the local people for coming down. I thank everyone who performed on stage at the Margate Festival. I was talking to a very talented young woman, Amy Dooley, who is 15 and who is from Steps Dance Centre. She performed on stage along with everyone from Steps Dance Centre. The Redcliffe City Choir was very good and performed well. There were many sponsors of the Margate Festival including Nick Tzimas from the Golden Ox, Lynn Mather from

        There were three levels of government involved with sponsoring, not just me but also the state member of parliament and the local councillor Koliana Winchester. We all had the opportunity to light the Margate Christmas tree. Thank you everyone. Make sure this Christmas you shop locally. Margate is a great place to live, work and shop.
