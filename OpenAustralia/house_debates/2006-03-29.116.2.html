        proposes to redevelop its post-1945 conflicts galleries—the Korea, Vietnam, peacekeeping and recent conflicts galleries—and Discovery Room at a potential total estimated cost of $17.8 million. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that the proposed works should proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will begin in July this year and be completed by October 2007. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. IP Australia accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the later stages of the base building construction.  Both are due for completion in early September 2007. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

         Whilst I support the motion, I do want to draw to the House’s attention again that many women—and in fact many men—in this place are finding it somewhat frustrating each time a

         reference comes up that sees us spending public moneys on facilities that are within the

          Parliamentary Triangle
         </a>
         we still are not able to see a commitment to funding child care in this place. It is somewhat frustrating to continually be voting on a number of Public Works bills for things which are obviously very important, yet we still cannot get funding in this building for a child-care centre for women and men with children.
