        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care. The aged-care royal commission placed workforce at the heart of its recommendations to fix an aged-care system broken by a decade of neglect. How is the Albanese Labor government supporting our skilled aged-care workers and building a better future for the sector?

         I thank the member for Makin for his question and acknowledge the work that he does locally in supporting our aged-care workers to provide for a better future for our older Australians. The Albanese Labor government deeply values our workforce in aged care. For too long aged-care workers were undervalued for the crucial work that they perform, but now, finally, they have a government which has their back. Thanks to the combined advocacy of the aged-care workers, of the unions, of the sector and of the Albanese Labor government, this workforce was awarded a life-changing pay rise from 1 July: 15 per cent on award wage minimums, the largest-ever increase to award wages in a work value case under the Fair Work Act. And we funded this with a historic $11.3 billion investment into the aged-care workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just this morning I visited aged-care workers and residents at Masonic Village in the beautiful suburb of Holt in the member for Fenner's electorate, 20 kilometres from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . There I met workers, including the always smiling Miko and Nina, who are so passionate about the privilege that they have in caring for our older Australians. Nina is a registered nurse and the care manager of the Masonic Village. When asked about the impact of the 15 per cent aged-care wage rise, she replied: 'It is wonderful. When I saw the pay rise, I said to myself, "Finally we have been rewarded."' Nina has worked in aged care for almost 20 years. The facility manager, Faye, described her as 'an absolute asset to the residents'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Miko has worked in aged care for 15 years, including seven years at the Masonic Village. She said that, when the pay rise began on 1 July, she looked at her pay slip and said, 'Wow, that's great.' Miko said aged-care workers needed to be recognised, and that's exactly what the Albanese Labor government has done.
        </p>
        <p>
         The general manager, Faye, said that the biggest impact she had seen from the pay advice is that, since July, far more of her younger care workers and nurses want to make a career out of aged care. This wage rise is changing lives. While those opposite wax lyrical about their supposed support for these workers now, they did not care to support this incredible workforce when they were in government for nine long years. They had every option to do so and they chose not to. After a wasted decade under this coalition, the Albanese Labor government is righting the wrongs, supporting these amazing workers and building a better future for aged care. Just you wait.
