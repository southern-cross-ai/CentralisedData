       <p>
        I rise this morning to celebrate the achievement of one of my very talented and hardworking constituents. Ms Yolande Morris, known to locals simply as 'Yo', has recently been awarded the National Rugby League Women in League achievement award for her services to local South Darwin Rugby League Football Club. It is great to have outstanding achievers in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        recognised on the national stage. Yo was chosen from six finalists from around Australia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the Territory could not have been prouder when she won. Yo has been a coach and on the committee for over a decade, a great achievement in itself. On behalf of our community, I personally thank Yo for her dedication to local rugby and, inadvertently, for keeping us fit and healthy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spent some time with Yo earlier this year before the federal election when I announced that the South Darwin Rugby League Football Club would receive $99,000 in Commonwealth funding for much needed upgrades to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Park
        </a>
        , the Souths juniors home ground, where a majority of the Northern Territory Junior Rugby League games are held. Upgrades to the park will include installation of a demountable for officials, roller door upgrades, construction and installation of removable shade structures, plumbing repairs, irrigation upgrades and reparation of field lights.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abbott" rel="nofollow">

        government recognises that local sport is an important aspect of the Territory community. Community sport organisations encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both children and adults. I thank Yo once again for her tireless efforts. I look forward to working with her when the coalition delivers on its election promise of $99,000 for the upgrade to Warren Park.
       </p>
       <p>
        In what little time I have left I would also like to acknowledge another extraordinary Territorian:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellie_Morris" rel="nofollow">
         Shellie Morris
        </a>
        . She is a very famous Territorian and I have spoken about her in this House before. Shellie is the Northern Territory finalist for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        award. Shellie is known worldwide for her singing and songwriting skills. Her music is very special and it really moves you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shellie toured with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yothu_Yindi" rel="nofollow">
         Yothu Yindi
        </a>
        , another famous Territory band. She has done some amazing work in Territory communities, helping Aboriginal people to write and share their stories. She also does some very good work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hollows_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Fred Hollows Foundation
        </a>
        . I wish Shellie all the best in January, and my fingers are crossed that she will be recognised nationally as the Australian of the Year.
