        Australians want to retain their autonomy as they age. Staying at home for as long as possible came out loud and clear in our consultations around aged-care reform. One group that is ahead of the curve is JoCare, a volunteer led organisation in Higgins that pairs volunteers with vulnerable elderly in the community they call neighbours. This matching service delivers companionship to elderly neighbours and the gift of service to volunteers, and it is slowing or, indeed, stopping the pathway to residential care. It's a win-win-win.
       </p>
       <p>
        JoCare also runs a digital platform to help elderly neighbours learn basic tech skills so that they can stay connected with family or friends. I had the pleasure of joining them at JoCare's Christmas celebration in December. I marvelled at the camaraderie, the togetherness and the sight of so many neighbours and volunteers, young and old alike. This is the intergenerational bridge in action. I pay tribute to chairperson Dr Susanne Tepe, secretary John Davies

        , and the entire committee for their leadership, and I encourage my constituents to volunteer their time and support JoCare in any way they can.

        What do we mean by wanting an inclusive country? Malvern Special Needs Playgroup has taken this to another level for children with complex needs. For over 50 years, the group has delivered individualised early intervention for children aged nine months to five years, and respite for parents. During my visit I saw littlies with significant disabilities or complex needs, like nasogastric feeding, truncal weakness or gait and dexterity problems, who were supported by a team of volunteers and therapists. There were experts in speech, physical and occupational therapy and play. Parents from Higgins, and well outside, are making the trip to Malvern Special Needs Playgroup. The children were engaged, and parents received a warm welcome and respite to attend to other matters while this impressive team swung into action. Parents regaled me with the importance of the centre and the need for more like it and sang the praises of the team. It is not only big reforms like the

        but small place-based interventions like Malvern Special Needs Playgroup that create the inclusive nation we strive for.
