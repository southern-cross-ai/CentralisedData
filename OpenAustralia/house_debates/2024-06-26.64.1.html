        My question is to the Prime Minister. Millions of people around the world, particularly in Australia, are thrilled by the news that

        has finally been set free and is on his way back home to Australia. Prime Minister, will you join with me in welcoming the end of this long-running saga and Mr Assange's return home to his family?

         I thank the member for Clark for his question, and I thank him, along with the parliamentary group co-chaired by the member for Fremantle, for their commitment to this issue that I recognise has involved some members of all political parties in this place, including members of the Liberal Party and the National Party.

         is on his way home to Australia. A short time ago, a United States court in Saipan accepted a plea agreement between Mr Assange and the United States Department of Justice. Mr Assange has since boarded a flight to Australia and will land in Australia later today. Regardless of your views about his activities—and they will be varied—Mr Assange's case has dragged on for too long. I've said repeatedly that there was nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration, and I am pleased that he is on his way home to Australia to reunite with his family here.

         Over the two years since we took office, my government has engaged and advocated, including at leader level, to resolve this. We have used all appropriate channels. This outcome has been the product of careful, patient and determined work, which I am very proud of. The Australian government continues to provide consular assistance to Mr Assange as he returns home, as we do for Australians right around the world. I can confirm that

         High Commissioner Stephen Smith are travelling to Australia with Mr Assange. I thank them for their work and others at the respective embassy and high commission for helping us to reach this conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         This work has been complex, and it has been considered. This is what standing up for Australians around the world looks like. It means getting the job done, getting results, getting outcomes and having the determination to stay the course. I am very pleased that, on this occasion, this has been a successful outcome that I believe Australians, overwhelmingly, did want to see. As I said, they will have different views about the engagement and the activities of Mr Assange, but they will be pleased that this saga has been brought to an end and that he will be able to reunite with his family.
