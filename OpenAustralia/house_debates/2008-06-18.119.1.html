       <p>
        In yet another promise kept by the Labor government, we saw last week the allocation of the first round of the computers in schools program and I was pleased to see that for the first time in a long while the funding of resources for schools was based on the needs of schools and not on a desire to gain political advantage for the party in government. Having seen the decline in the level of resources in schools in the Fowler electorate relative to other areas, I hope that the model used to allocate computers will be repeated in the allocation of other resources.

        In the first round, schools in the electorate of Fowler will receive a total of 2,251 computers. Those schools include seven public schools, two Catholic schools and two independent schools. Of the public schools, Ashcroft High will receive 147 computers, Bonnyrigg High 183, Bossley Park High 326, Cecil Hills High 297, Hoxton Park High 230 and James Busby High 104. Of the Catholic high schools,

        will receive 316 computers and Mary Mackillop College 242. Of the independent schools, Christadelphian Heritage College Sydney at

        will receive 144. The provision of these computers through the National Secondary School Computer Fund has been greatly welcomed by schools in Fowler.

        Last Thursday I visited Cecil Hills High School, where the principal, staff and students were delighted with the announcement of an allocation of 297 computers to bring the total number of computers in the school close to the target ratio of one computer for every two students. I can also clear up one concern that was raised with me at the time of my visit. Special needs education teachers at the school pointed out that disabled students often found it difficult to use laptop computers because of the small keyboard. I note that the program also includes the provision of desktop computers. While the aim of this program is to prepare Australian students for further education, training and employment and equip them with the skills they need to live, work and succeed in an increasingly digital world, I would stress that the program should—definitely should—include modified computers for special needs students. With computer training, special needs students can have a far greater chance of reaching their full potential. I congratulate the government on this digital education revolution.
