        To Muslims, Islam is the religion of peace and reason, yet increasingly in the Western world it is falsely seen as the seed that germinates terrorism. Just this month, like many of my colleagues, I joined members of my local community in the festivities celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The celebrations mark the breaking of the fast and are a significant occasion, not unlike the celebration of Easter by us Christians. It seems unfair to suppose that this event, just because it is held within Australia’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_community" rel="nofollow">
         Muslim community
        </a>
        , is tainted by a growing yet unfounded fear based on nothing else but cultural difference. Yet, increasingly, this is unfortunately what is happening in our society today.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia, people of different faiths and cultures find themselves marginalised despite this country’s claims to multiculturalism. This week the headlines have been dominated by the actions of the Muslim cleric Sheikh al-Hilali, who yesterday, amid the controversy, stood aside from his position as imam at Sydney’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakemba_Mosque" rel="nofollow">
         Lakemba Mosque
        </a>
        . Today’s Melbourne newspaper headlines were dominated by comments made by Melbourne’s Sheikh Omran.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not defending either of the sheikhs in making these remarks—the community will judge them appropriately—but we cannot hold the entire Muslim community accountable for the words of a small minority. It would be a failing of the Australian community to do this and to demonise the entire Muslim community in painting the community with the same brush that marks the exceptional few who practise Islam and who defy common laws and human decency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terrorism in our community is rare, but on the rise is an intolerance of difference. Difference is not something we should shy away from. It is something that can actually enrich our lives, and it is something that we should openly value, promote and embrace. On that note, I want to refer to the remarks of the President of the Alawi Islamic Social Centre at a ceremony last Saturday night celebrating the end of Ramadan. It is about time some people took these comments on board. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We respect and hold Australia dear to our hearts and the first lesson we teach our children is to love and respect its laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        He then went on to state:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our main aim is to protect Australia and ensure its safety, because our future and that of our children is undoubtedly that of our chosen country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fearmongering, the unfounded vilification of minority groups, bigotry and indiscriminate attacks on innocent citizens are what we need to be cautious of, to fear, to shun and to walk away from in our society. Yes, those imams who have made mistakes should be held accountable, but we should be very careful in this debate not to demonise the Muslim community, who are no different to anyone else in Australia’s rich, prosperous and tolerant society. Multiculturalism has been good for Australia. It is about time people stood up.
