        The incidence of ice addiction in our communities is frightening. While ice addiction may not have passed alcohol problems in number, it appears the drug causes in people responses we have not seen before. The proliferation of ice will not be arrested through public meetings. More often than not, those turning to drugs are facing some form of depression, abuse or marginalisation. A response to the ice scourge must be greater resources—that is, more money for our police and more money for those who support those with mental health problems or those with addictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        More broadly, there is no better response to marginalisation than to put a person in a job. Sadly, Australia now has an unemployment rate higher than that experienced during the global financial crisis, and that is particularly true in my own region, the

        . Not only has the Abbott government allowed the jobless rate to rise; it has been cutting funding to the many not-for-profit organisations that offer support and counselling to those with problems. The Prime Minister's strategy must change. If it does not change, the epidemic will grow worse and the unemployment rate will grow worse.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a happier note, I want to acknowledge three high achievers in the Hunter electorate.

        Jordan and Ryan are reminders of how dangerous and wrong it is to stereotype our youth. Some face challenges, yes, but it has always been thus. Some run off the rails, yes, but it has always been the case. But many more—indeed, the overwhelming majority—are doing things that we could not have imagined when we were their age. We should encourage them while offering a hand up to those who need and deserve it.
