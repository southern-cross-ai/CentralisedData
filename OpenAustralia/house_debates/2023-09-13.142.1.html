        Northsiders made the most of a perfect Brisbane spring day on Sunday to join in the celebrations of the 21st annual Nundah Festival in my electorate of Lilley. This wonderful community event is always a highlight of the Northside festival calendar, and I was particularly impressed with the live performances by the Nundah

        drum corps. Lilley locals took the opportunity to lend their support for the Voice to Parliament referendum at the festival, with the Yes23 stall running out of T-shirts, corflutes and stickers very quickly. Thank you to all the volunteers and Nundah Now who contributed their time and effort, and congratulations to the Nundah Festival committee and all involved in making this day such a great success. I look forward to seeing them all there again next year.

        On 10 September it was my great honour as the member for Lilley to attend the 150th birthday celebrations of Sandgate State School. This wonderful school located in the northern bayside suburbs of Brisbane opened its doors just three years after Queensland became the first state in Australia to introduce free primary school education, back in 1870. Sandgate State School started 28 years before Australia established its parliament and 45 years before my electorate of Lilley was created. I'd like to thank all the teachers, school staff, students and parents both past and present for the invaluable contributions they have made to our community over the decades. I wish them every success into the future, and I look forward to looking as good at 150 as Sandgate State School does!

I especially acknowledge our own Geebung RSL president, Harry Boxsell, who was awarded life membership of the Brisbane North District RSL on 6 September. Congratulations, Harry. You are a stalwart of our community. This is a very well-earned recognition of your voluntary service over many years to the Geebung RSL sub-branch, board, club members, staff, local schools and the greater Northside community. We appreciate you.
