        . Evidence in Senate estimates has revealed the Albanese government has released seven murderers, 37 sex offenders, 16 domestic violence and stalking offenders, 13 serious drug offenders and 72 other violent criminals from immigration detention. So far, 18 of these criminals have been charged by state and territory police for new offences. Can the minister explain why he has failed to apply for a single community safety detention order?

          I thank the shadow minister for his question, again. It is worth restating for his and for all members' benefit that the release of these individuals was required by the decision of the High Court in November last year and would have been required under any government. Since then, we have been working around the clock to ensure the community is kept safe. We have done so by putting in place four layers of protection, one of which is, of course, the regime that was the subject of legislation that was put through the parliament at the end of last year that provides for preventative detention and ongoing supervision orders.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm sure the shadow minister, like the Leader of the Opposition, would be aware that this is modelled on the high-risk terrorist offenders scheme. He may well be aware that it took more than three years for the first continuing detention order application after that regime was enacted. Three years and 10 months was the shortest period of time for an application to be made to the court under members opposite under the regime from him and other members, including the Leader of the Opposition, who was the minister responsible for putting in place the high-risk terrorist offenders regime. I think we can see this question in that light and also in another light, and this is something that all members should be aware of—something that Senator Paterson pointed out. He said there is 'a very high legal threshold to be met for a court to agree to the ongoing detention of an offender who continues to pose an unacceptable risk'. This is exactly why we need to treat this with the caution and determined application it deserves.

          <p>
           I thank the wonderful member for Robertson for his question. It is indeed great to get a question about young people and about what the Australian government, the Albanese government, is doing for young Australians. The Albanese government not only values the ideas and the experiences of young people but also listens to them. Last year, we undertook nationwide consultations with young Australians aged between 12 and 25. Those consultations provided us an opportunity to engage directly with young Australians on the issues that matter to them the most. We ran 58 consultations right across Australia, and the young people very clearly told us that the No.1 issue for young Australians right now is cost of living.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I said, Mr Speaker, the Albanese government listens. We listen to young people and we listen to our constituents. That's why from 1 July we are delivering a tax cut for every working Australian, making a real difference to 13.6 million Australians. That includes 1.5 million taxpayers aged between 18 and 24. They are going to get an average tax cut of $1,007 under our new tax plan. Taxpayers aged between 25 and 29—that is, 1.6 million taxpayers—are going to receive an average tax cut of $1,573 under Labor's tax plan. These tax cuts are good for young people, they're good for young Australians, they're good for middle Australia and, of course, they are good for our economy. As an example, a young person juggling part-time study and working in retail who earns $30,000 will receive a tax cut of $354 under Labor's plan and, on top of that, another $172 from the changes to the Medicare levy. This is on top of the billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief that we are already delivering for young Australians in cheaper medicines, in energy price relief, in boosting rent assistance—the biggest increase in 30 years—and through increases to JobSeeker,

           , ABSTUDY and Austudy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Albanese government has undertaken a course of reaching out to young people, involving them in consultations and listening to them—listening to the ways in which the policies that government makes affect them and what we can do better for them. We have heard the concerns and we are acting on them. (

I do say again, though, that the release of these individuals was required by reason of the decision of the High Court, a decision that any government would have to comply with. I say again that the management of everyone in that cohort has been subject to the expert advice of the men and women of the Community Protection Board—and that is advice that we have acted upon—a composed of trusted law enforcement officials.
