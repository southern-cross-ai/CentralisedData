       <p>
        I rise today to update the House on how the Aged Care Approvals Round, or ACAR, of the Capital Grants Program for 2016-17 will positively impact Swan. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Aged Care,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Wyatt
        </a>
        , on the work he and his staff and department have put into this funding round. I had the pleasure this morning of joining the Prime Minister, the Minister for Aged Care and a number of my parliamentary colleagues, who are in this room now, at the unveiling of the minister's portrait, in honour of his election as the first Indigenous member of parliament. It was a very special morning and it was a privilege to be part of it. I am very proud to call Ken Wyatt a friend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Returning to ACAR, there are 9,911 new residential aged care places, worth an estimated $649.2 million in annual recurrent funding; there are 475 new short-term restorative care places, worth an estimated $34.7 million in annual recurrent funding; and $64 million in capital grants to enable new or existing providers to undertake necessary capital works.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a highly competitive application process that enables prospective and existing approved providers of aged care to apply for a range of Australian government funded aged care places and financial assistance. Two organisations in Swan have been successful:    Burswood Care in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , receiving a total of 120 residential care places; and, in addition to this, SwanCare Group's new service, 'Cassia' in Bentley, has also received 120 residential care places. In monetary terms, $15,720,000 for the seat of Swan.
