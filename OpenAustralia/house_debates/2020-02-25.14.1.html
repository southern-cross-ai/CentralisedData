        As much as I love my work in this place, I must confess that I like spending time in my community and talking to people face-to-face even more. This is why, last Friday, I went out to Blackburn for a coffee and chat with some local residents. Firstly, let me thank the Food Republic Cafe in Blackburn for hosting me. Businesses such as these are benefiting from the Morrison governments instant asset write-off. Cafe owners can invest in an extra coffee machine or oven with confidence. It was great to speak to a wide range of peopleâ€”from kids enjoying their curriculum day off school to workers in nearby offices and factories and older people about to celebrate their 90th birthday. I got to hear how glad they are that we have a strong economy and more jobs. I got to hear how this government's aged-care policies are having a positive impact on the lives of senior Australians. More than 16,000 age pensioners in my electorate of Chisholm are better off because of this government. I always enjoy meeting people I represent, and I love hearing their views. If you see me out and about, please feel free to come and talk to me in person.
