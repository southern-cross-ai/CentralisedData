        Deputy Speaker Scott, I recently had the opportunity to meet Professor Nian-Shing Chen of the National Sun Yat-Sen University in Taiwan. Professor Chen is currently a visiting professor at the School of Languages and Comparative Cultural Studies at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Fellow" rel="nofollow">
         Research Fellow
        </a>
        at the Hear and Say centre at Auchenflower in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Chen is an international expert in the area of e-learning, with particular expertise in synchronous learning technologies and best practices of online synchronous teaching and learning. He is currently working with Hear and Say to further develop their e-learning and online courses so that deaf children around the world can learn to hear, listen and speak.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trainees in more than 30 countries have already received training from Hear and Say WorldWide using the Collaborative Cyber Community 3C
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

        platform, which was invented by Professor Chen. I was honoured to accept Dimity Dornan's invitation to join Professor Chen and his colleagues at Hear and Say recently to celebrate his becoming an Australian citizen. He also proudly showed us his brand new Australian passport! It is wonderful to see such inspirational people choose to make Australia home, and I wish him well with his continuing work at Hear and Sayâ€”and for people around the world.
