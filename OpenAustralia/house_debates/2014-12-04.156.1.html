        I stand to give the last speech for the government in the Federation Chamber for the year. As we all know, it is not easy having the last word in this place so this is a good feeling. In fact, there is, for the most part, a lot of good feeling about as we end the sitting year and move into Christmas.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a year of huge achievement for the government. We set out to build a strong and prosperous economy and we have put the foundations firmly in place to do just that. The government has created over 100,000 new jobs in its first year. We have started investment in massive infrastructure programs—road, rail, bridge building, telecommunications and the

        airport—the likes of which have not been seen in Australia for a generation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have signed historic trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China, and the economic benefits will be felt for decades. We have scrapped damaging and unnecessary taxes. We have made Australia safe and secure and reclaimed our borders by turning back the boats. We have backed the small business sector by cutting red tape and compliance costs. We have reprioritised the rollout of fast broadband at a cheaper cost and far sooner than Labor could ever have delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across my electorate of Hume, which stretches from the edge of Canberra to Picton in Sydney's south, I have sent a newsletter to local businesses reminding them of the great successes we have enjoyed. In scrapping the carbon tax, businesses like Gusollio's Hair and Spa at Young have seen power bills plummet. Owner Melissa McColl says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The carbon tax was an impost I couldn't afford. If the power bills had continued to go up, I was looking at having to cut back on staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tahmoor Colliery in the north of my electorate says that the carbon tax made Australian industry 'less competitive'. Owner of Hilltop Meats at Young, Ted Campbell, says that now the tax is gone costs of production have fallen and that his abattoir can operate in the highly competitive global marketplace. This is proof that our policies are working.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business is thanking the coalition government for a framework for growth and prosperity. In cutting red tape, we have taken the pressure off small businesses, which is helping them create more jobs. Where there are no

        reporting requirements, 45,000 small businesses Australia wide will no longer have to lodge a business activity statement. Another 402,000 small businesses will now be exempt from the pay-as-you-go requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great success in my electorate has been the reprioritised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        rollout. Just earlier this week I was able to announce an additional 27,000 premises will be connected to the fixed line network across Hume in the next 18 months. Fibre will be rolled out in a number of the larger towns in my electorate, including Goulburn, Yass, Cowra and Young, as well as across the Wollondilly shire and parts of the Wingecarribee shire. Fixed wireless towers are going up across the west of Hume, with services already switched on outside Young and Cowra and in smaller locations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has had a great year of achievement, particularly given the enormous clean-up job we were left with. We have taken huge strides forward in clearing the debris of six years of Labor—financial debris that has left Australian families struggling with mounting debt. As I travel around, I often hear that families are most concerned, not necessarily about national debt and deficit, but about their own personal budgets. There is a straightforward answer here and a message for the new year: the fastest way to pay back debt, be it government, business or household debt, is to have rising incomes. To deliver rising incomes in the coming decade, we do not need to work harder but we do need to work smarter. Working smarter will deliver rising incomes. It always has and it always will.
       </p>
       <p>
        But back to my final word. After a busy and successful year, my first in federal parliament and the first of a new government, we should not be too quick to point to failings or missed opportunities. The government is steering a steady course to economic stability and prosperity and that should be a great comfort for all Australians. On behalf of the government, I wish all of Australia a happy and safe festive season. I wish my parliamentary colleagues, with a special mention to you, Deputy Speaker, a very merry Christmas. May you all eat lots of cherries from Young and have a well-earned break with family and friends.

         I think we all agree with that one as well! I thank the member for Hume.
