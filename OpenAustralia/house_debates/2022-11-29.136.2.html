        () (): Over the past fortnight, I've been contacted by several Kooyong residents who have been alarmed and distressed to hear that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RED" rel="nofollow">
         RED
        </a>
        cycle has paused its operations and about the allegations that it has not been appropriately recycling soft plastics. Jacqui wrote: 'The announcement that REDcycle [is] pausing operations this week is a sad day for the environment.' She worries, appropriately, that the news will affect consumer confidence in recycling efforts. Meg tells me: 'It's a little like the straw that breaks my back,' and 'I hope the government can begin to make strong climate policies.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is precisely what two innovative and enterprising members of my Kooyong community have done. It gives me immense pride to bring to parliament a story of two inspiring women from Kooyong, Catherine Krestyn and Jennie Irving, who identified a clear need and a gap in what governments at all levels provide in terms of education, facilities and services for people to be able to live sustainably, and who decided to fill that gap themselves by creating the Boroondara Hard Rubbish Rehome.
       </p>
       <p>
        The core business of Boroondara Hard Rubbish Rehome is to support a local, circular economy. Founded by five members in early September 2022, its membership is already close to 2,000 and is growing by over 100 a week. These 2,000 'rehomies' are working together to rescue good items from hard rubbish piles so they don't get sent to landfill but are instead rehomed. The items rescued are rehomed with individuals but also given to a range of community groups, for programs supported by a number of Rotary organisations and animal welfare groups, for families fleeing domestic violence and for the Pacific Island Labour Mobility scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        The BHRR is committed to documenting what is diverted to landfill. Jennie and Cath weigh and catalogue everything they rescue from the hard rubbish. To date, they've diverted more than 3.7 tonnes of goods from landfill, rehoming those across our community. They're also re-educating and reframing the discussion around hard waste into one about redistributing resources—whether this involves re-using, repurposing, recycling or repairing—through the correct channels. This is a key part of our circular economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the honour of being supported in my run for office by Cath and Jen. They volunteered on my campaign. They ensured that all waste created by the campaign was carefully sorted and sent to the appropriate recycling, composting and rehoming schemes. My heartfelt congratulations go to Cath and Jen and all of our rehomies for bringing this very powerful grassroots initiative to life. They're building a positive, respectful community within a community. I commend to the House this volunteer-driven grassroots initiative bridging the gap in recycling services.
