       <p>
        It is my belief that the key to rural and regional Australia having a strong, long-term sustainable and happy future lies in a coordinated approach to regional development. We need a clear vision for our future, and we need mechanisms for coordination, planning and advocacy. Last Friday I had the pleasure of meeting with the Hume Regional Development Australia committee,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
         RDA
        </a>
        Hume, and learning of the excellent work they are undertaking to bring such a future to the people of Indi.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional Development Australia is an initiative of the Commonwealth government. It brings together all levels of government to support the development of regional Australia. It is based on a national network of 55 RDA committees made up of local leaders who work in a voluntary capacity with all levels of government, business and community groups. In Victoria, RDAs are a joint initiative of the Commonwealth and the Victorian government department of regional development.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to report to this House that RDA Hume has a strong history of success in advocating for our region's interests; encouraging greater connection between all levels of government, community, business and industry; supporting implementation of regional priorities; and facilitating advancement of growth and development opportunities. In a practical way, RDA Hume is helping the community adapt to a future with less water; planning for a low-carbon energy future; revitalising our regional cities, centres, towns and villages; developing our tourism facilities; building strong manufacturing and agricultural sectors supported by a capable workforce; positioning the Hume region in the global food economy; linking communities through building transport capacity and capability; and taking collective action and developing strategies for our digital future and building digital readiness across the region. I would like to draw to the attention of this Chamber five important reports that have been authorised by RDA.
        <i>
         Freight directions in the Hume region
        </i>
        ,
        <i>
         Digital Hume: a digital strategy for a smart region
        </i>
        ; Hume Regional Tracks and Trails Strategy;
        <i>
         Food opportunities in Northern Victoria
        </i>
        ;and, importantly,
        <i>
         Aspirations and destinations of young people: a study of four towns and their communities and schools in central Hume, Victoria
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        RDAs do really important work. They have proven to be the pivotal point in planning regional development. In Indi and the Hume region they are playing a vital role in coordinating regional planning. They need our continued support and resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank the Hume RDA for their outstanding work.
       </p>
