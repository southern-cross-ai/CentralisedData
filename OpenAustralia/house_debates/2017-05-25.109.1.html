       <p>
        Today I would like to shine a spotlight on Australian Innovative Systems, an outstanding company in my Bonner electorate that continues to impress, year on year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, the Prime Minister and I had the pleasure of touring their Tingalpa factory. It was great to hear from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Elena Gosse, about how the government's measures to help small-and medium-sized businesses will benefit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIS" rel="nofollow">
         AIS
        </a>
        and its customers. AIS has been a leading designer, manufacturer and supplier of water disinfection technology and chlorine generators for over 20 years. It now employs over 60 staff and exports products to over 55 countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        AIS has been recognised for its innovative work with an incredible number of awards. This includes being named Australian Small Business Champion in the manufacturing category and winner for best innovation culture in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRW" rel="nofollow">
         BRW
        </a>
        's 50 Most Innovative Companies award.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister also commended AIS last week for its ongoing commitment to innovation. We were very impressed when seeing its range of chlorine generators for commercial and residential swimming pools. As the Prime Minister put it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is what innovation enterprise is all about.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also said that small- and medium-sized businesses like AIS are at the heart of our economic future.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why this government is continuing to support small businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million by lowering their tax rate to 27.5 per cent, the lowest level in 50 years. This follows global trends and will allow Australian businesses to compete globally. We are also extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off scheme and introducing the new Skilling Australians Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        CEO, Elena Gosse, told us how these measures will benefit AIS. Our company tax cuts will help their bottom line, which will allow them to invest more in research and development, expand their production and create more local jobs. The extension of the $20,000 instant asset write-off scheme will also assist its customers. Eligible swim schools and aquatic facilities will be able to purchase pumps and filtration systems from AIS and claim an immediate deduction for depreciation of up to $20,000 each financial year. This is a great incentive for businesses to upgrade their equipment and to support a homegrown company like AIS.
       </p>
       <p>
        Companies like AIS will also benefit from the Skilling Australians Fund. The government is providing a record $1.5 billion through the fund to help train Australian apprentices and trainees in key trades, helping them to gain the skills that they need for jobs in demand. It will give people more opportunities to be an apprentice or trainee. It will also give employers more opportunities to support apprentices and trainees.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank Elena and the AIS staff for hosting the Prime Minister and me, and for providing and supporting so many local jobs in my electorate. Their success is very much deserved, and I look forward to seeing them grow and achieve greater things over the coming years.
