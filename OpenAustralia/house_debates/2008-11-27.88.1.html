        This weekend I will be attending a function to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Cypriot community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia

        . Cypriots were first recorded in Australia in the 1850s. They were mainly Cypriots who came to Australia as gold prospectors. But after the British takeover of Cyprus in 1878 more Cypriots arrived, with many working their way to Australia as crewmen on British ships or coming on British passports. The first significant arrival of Cyprus-born immigrants began after World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , in response to the politically unstable homeland. Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960, but in 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and displaced nearly half of the island’s total population. This caused increasing numbers of Cypriots to migrate to Australia, with the community almost doubling in size. In my electorate, for example, there are well over 2,000 people who identify themselves as Australian Cypriots.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say that the Australian government continues its support for a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        resolution for the peaceful resolution and reunification of the island. We recently saw the appointment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Downer" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander Downer
        </a>
        as United Nations Special Envoy to Cyprus. I would like to congratulate Mr Downer on his appointment. I had the pleasure of meeting with him to discuss some of these issues, and I am sure that he will do all he can to ensure a peaceful resolution and a peaceful reunification of the island soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we celebrate this significant anniversary this weekend, the Australian government will be continuing its support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and for achieving a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         The Republic
        </a>
        of Cyprus has resolved that any actions which are contrary to binding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
         UN Security Council
        </a>
        resolutions in Cyprus should be avoided. The primary goal of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Cyprus" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Republic of Cyprus
        </a>
        , His Excellency Mr Demetris Christofias—whom I have had the pleasure of meeting on two occasions—is for a just, viable and functional solution to the Cyprus problem in accordance with UN resolutions on Cyprus, international and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        law. The President’s initiatives have led to the resumption of fully-fledged negotiations under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. The aim of Cyprus is for a solution that will reunite the territory, the people, the institutions and the economy of the country, restore and safeguard the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Cypriots, and terminate the occupation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Republic of Cyprus believes this can be achieved in accordance with the agreed basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation—as envisaged by the 1977-79 high-level agreements with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions—with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship and a single international personality. The Republic of Cyprus hopes that foreign troops are withdrawn and that Turkey, with whom the key to a solution lies, will show the necessary political will and constructive approach in light of the direct negotiations currently underway. For instance, illegal settlers, guarantees and the withdrawal of occupational troops from the island are fundamental issues that Turkey has to deal with.
