        . The reaction of Melburnians to this hack attack and to the Chinese consulate’s attempt to close down the Melbourne film festival was to decide that the audience in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Union" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        theatre was too small, with 800 people. No, film-goers would not appease this bullying. As a result,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Town_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Town Hall
        </a>
        was booked, where I had the honour of introducing Rebiya Kadeer and where she spoke to more than 2,000 people. So the love of free speech and the love of film are very strong in Melbourne.

        It is very interesting that one of the premier international film critics, Mr Richard Brody of the
        <i>
         New Yorker
        </i>
        , surmised that this hack attack was the tacit work of the Chinese government. Brody argued that film festivals around the world should not stand for Beijing’s attempts at censorship. That was the implication of this headline ‘We are all Melburnian’, just as it was with the famous headline in
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde" rel="nofollow">
          Le Monde

        </i>
        after the attacks of September 11, ‘We are all Americans’. Mr Brody said:

        … should be instantly programmed for all upcoming film festivals; I’d like to see it included in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Toronto International Film Festival
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         New York Film Festival
        </a>
        , coming in October; in Venice, Sundance, Berlin, Rotterdam, Cannes—all the festivals that matter in the industry should show Daniels’s film. Festival directors would thereby affirm their solidarity with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Festival
        </a>
        and its courageous director,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Moore" rel="nofollow">

        , against government pressure.

        the Chinese embassy tried to get the Press Club to deny her a platform. Most Australians would have resented the hysterical attacks on Australia and the admission of this non-violent Uighur activist to Australia in the Chinese

        as yesterday’s

        reported. I had the honour of being singled out by this kind of prejudice, along with Senator Barnaby Joyce, in another propaganda rag called the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times" rel="nofollow">

        , which comes out of Beijing.
       </p>
       <p>
        China’s attempts to muzzle the Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer during her current Australian visit are, as the
        <i>
         Canberra Times
        </i>
        noted, hypocrisy. China does not want people to interfere in their affairs but is willing to interfere in ours. On such occasions Australia should firmly and politely remind the Chinese government that freedom of speech and association is an inviolable part of this country’s political fabric. That is what the Australian government has been doing. We are going to keep our nerve with all of these national security issues, keep good relations with China and keep freedom of speech in Australia.
