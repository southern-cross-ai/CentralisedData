        Mr Speaker, the note was not from me, but I have a question for you. I would like to seek your clarification on standing orders. During question time today the Leader of the House stood on a point of order and then proceeded to debate the point of order, which I understand is against standing orders. I rose to make a point of order and to bring to your attention that the Leader of the House was in fact debating that point of order. Standing order 86(a) says a member may raise a point of order with the Speaker at any time, which is what I sought to do; however, you did not give me the call. Could you clarify whether a member can or cannot raise a point of order or seek to raise a point of order with you at any time.

         My first proviso is that I am not encouraging this sort of questioning of things that happen during question time. But, as it happened only a few moments ago and I did offer him the chance to make a point of order, I will tell the member for Aston that if he goes off and does his homework and reads the
         <i>
          House of Representatives Practice
         </i>
         he will see that that was well within what has happened in the past. I think that I could have anticipated what you were actually going to say. I was willing to let the Leader of the House finish and then give you the opportunity to raise your point of order at that point in time. It was not a matter of denying you the right to have your point of order; it is a debate about what ‘immediate’ actually means. If you look at the precedents that are covered by the
         <i>
          House of Representatives Practice
         </i>
         you will see that that has happened in the past.
