       <p>
        Yesterday the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        boasted about the fact that he had had a talkfest with energy retailers. Well done, PM—the day before,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGL" rel="nofollow">
         AGL
        </a>
        sent hundreds of emails to Victorian customers. I quote from one of the emails a constituent in my electorate received on Tuesday, the day before the talk fest: 'Due to a system error, you've been mistakenly receiving a discount on your electricity bill. As you're no longer eligible for the discount under the terms of your energy plan, it will be corrected from 27 August 2017.' Well done, PM—a day after AGL had written to people in my electorate saying they would no longer receive a discount. This particular customer has been hit with the increase in electricity prices. Last year the same usage was about $300 for the month of July. This year it's $406 for the same usage for the month of July. That's a massive increase to this particular household. This is after this mob in opposition said that every household in the Bendigo electorate would receive a discount in their energy bills—$550 in the pocket for every single household and business. They turned up to fish and chips shops and said, 'This place will get a discount on their energy bills.' They were wrong. Bills have gone up and up because of this government's failure in leadership and failure to crack down on wholesale prices. Their lack of leadership is costing Australians jobs.
