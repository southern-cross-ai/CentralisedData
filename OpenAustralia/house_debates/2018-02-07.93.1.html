           I thank the member for Mackellar for the question. It is vital that employer and employee organisations always act in the best interests of their members, and that is exactly why the Turnbull coalition government established the Registered Organisations Commission. And why is it needed? Just this week, we have learnt that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
            George Clarke
           </a>
           , who was the

            New South Wales
           </a>

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
            Transport Workers Union
           </a>
           , the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">
            TWU
           </a>
           , has resigned in protest. But, not only has he resigned in protest, he has given an insight into exactly the reasons why this commission was necessary. On his way out the door, he's let loose with a great spray. He has come out publicly and blown the whistle on the expenditure of members' money by the management of the TWU. He has said that the New South Wales TWU state secretary, Mr Richard Olsen, has spent members' money in a list of ways, and some of them are as follows. Thousands of members' dollars on long lunches. Thousands of members' dollars on overseas trips for officials. Thousands of members' dollars—and I don't understand this one—on black vinyl lounges, but at least it wasn't leather, so he was probably saving the members some money! Thousands of dollars on legal fees and thousands of dollars on political donations, including donations to the member for Greenway's campaign, which were not properly authorised. It's all sounding very familiar, isn't it? But this part's not familiar. What has Mr Olsen done? Mr Clarke has broken the silence, he's quit in disgust, and he's said himself, 'We are a robust union, but there are guys treating it like it's their union, not members' money.' To add insult to injury—I don't believe the gall of Mr Olsen—the TWU are planning a new $2 million headquarters. And what's Mr Olsen going to do after spending all the members' money? He's been there 16 months, and he's going to name the building after himself! It is going to be Richard Olsen House! You cannot make this stuff up; Richard Olsen House, the new state premises for the New South Wales Transport Workers' Union.
          </p>
          <p>
           The sad part is, while I've taken the micky out of this, this stuff actually goes on. It's exactly why we established the Registered Organisations Commission and exactly why we passed legislation through this place about corrupting benefits. Union members pay their membership fees in good faith, and union officials should act in good faith as well. And if they don't, they should bloody well be held to account!
