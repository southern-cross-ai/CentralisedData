        Mr Speaker, I have a question to you, and it concerns your ruling which you laid out prior to question time concerning the events in the parliament on 15 February 2007. Part of the concern that I do not think you have addressed goes to the fact, which
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        will record, of, at about 3.21 pm on that day, my raising an objection about a remark being withdrawn and your directing the Leader of the House: ‘Then the minister will withdraw that last accusation.’ Part of the concern that we on this side of the House raised was the fact that the Leader of the House responded, ‘I am a little confused.’ That was his response to your direction that the remark be withdrawn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, as you pointed out in quoting
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        , it is up to the chair to determine whether or not language is offensive or disorderly. In that ruling you clearly indicated that it was disorderly language. You clearly asked the member to withdraw it, and he refused to do so and defied your ruling. Because of that, parliament was disrupted by a number of points of order for at least another 10 minutes. It is still an issue today. I ask you to reflect on that matter and report back to the House. I indicate to you on behalf of the opposition that we certainly do not regard the term that was used as being parliamentary or appropriate in this House. It was used again today.

         It may assist the House if I indicate to the member for Grayndler that, if the Leader of the Opposition finds the term objectionable, I will certainly withdraw it. But, as I have said before, will the real

          <p>
           We are now getting back into a situation whereby your position, as the custodian of the rules and proceedings of this House, is being drawn into question. It is not up to the Leader of the Opposition to object; it is up to you to determine, in accordance with the section of
           <i>
            House of Representatives Practice
           </i>
           that you read into
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           prior to question time today, whether indeed language is parliamentary or not. It quite clearly is not parliamentary language. You indicated that. The Leader of the House defied you, as he did just then, in his response.

              I thank the member for his assistance. I remind all members that I made a statement at the beginning of question time to cover this specific area. I said, amongst other things, that I had done some research. I said the previous sitting Thursday that, had the individual member found something offensive, I would give consideration to asking that it be withdrawn. I have ruled on the issue and I do not propose to revisit it.

                    I will not have the point debated. If you wish to raise a question, that is in order, but it is not a matter for debate.

                     Mr Speaker, I am raising a question with you. My question is very simple: is that a precedent that you will follow—that is, upon being asked to withdraw by you it is acceptable for a member to not do that?

                      I say to the Manager of Opposition Business that we have discussed this. I have given a statement today. I do not propose to revisit proceedings from a previous day any further.
