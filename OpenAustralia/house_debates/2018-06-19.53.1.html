        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. Will the minister update the House on how a strong economy means essential services like the defence of our nation can be assured? What would be the impact of alternative policy directions?

         I hate to contradict any of my colleagues on the front bench, but some of them have been saying in question time today that not one member of the Labor Party knows anything about the aspirations of Australians. Well, there is one actually—with quite a lot of aspiration. The member for Grayndler knows all about aspiration. I don't like to contradict the minister for revenue, who said not one member of the Labor Party knows anything about aspiration, but our friend over here, 'old china', has quite a lot of aspiration. A few people have been saying that the member for Sydney might pip him at the post. Well, after this morning, I reckon he has already got her under the chariot wheels. He has only got one more to go—our friend over here, the Leader of the Opposition.

         were you, Anthony, I would be getting my suit dry-cleaned, because you might get there faster than you think. You are sitting there looking like a sphinx, but your aspiration is well known to us all. Mr Speaker, that's the introduction to my answer! My answer—

          That's good. The minister could perhaps hit his pause button for a second, because I was about to say story time is over. You're not reading it very well now.

           Mr Speaker, because of the government's excellent economic management of the budget and the economy, we have been able to make sure we can invest in our defence industry and our national security in this country. Because of the management of the budget and economic management, we can invest in 12 submarines, nine Future Frigates, 12 offshore patrol vessels and 21 Pacific patrol boats for our Pacific neighbours. Labor was never able to invest in any. We are able to invest in Poseidons and Tridents for our reconnaissance and surveillance. We are able to improve and upgrade every single Army, Navy and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Air Force
           </a>
           base in Australia and build combat reconnaissance vehicles here in this country, driving $200 billion of investment in our military capability that Labor could never have afforded.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Labor Party have announced today that they will vote against income tax cuts for all Australians. This privileged elite who want to ensure for themselves—

          <p>
           I was a cleaner in my first job. But I'm glad I wasn't represented by the Leader of the Opposition, 'old Mr Cleanevent' over here. I would have lost all my resources as a university student. This privileged elite want to deny people $70 billion worth of tax cuts. We want to deliver $140 billion of tax cuts. They say it is $70 billion or zero. It is like offering people crispy roast pork with apple sauce and then just serving them the apple sauce. That's what Labor wants to do—half a hamburger, not all of it.
