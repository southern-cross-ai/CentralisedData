       <p>
        Last week I was very privileged to have two of the fantastic public schools in my electorate visit me here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Students from Blacksmiths Public School visited Parliament House on Wednesday; and students from Swansea Public School visited on Thursday.
       </p>
       <p>
        These were young year 5 and 6 students making the yearly trek to Canberra to our wonderful capital and to visit parliament to learn about how our democracy works here in Australia. They attended the Parliamentary Education Office. They visited both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then I met with them up in hospitality. I talked to them about parliament and our own area. I asked them some questions about the different levels of government, and in return they asked me some questions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great exchange of ideas and information. It shows me what great students are being educated in our public primary schools. These were wonderful outstanding young people who really showed that they understood what government was about. They understood how important it was to have a sound government, a democratic government, with both sides of the political spectrum represented.
