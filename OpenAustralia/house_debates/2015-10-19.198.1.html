        convoy, which saw trucks driving up and down Townsville honking their horns, and people on motorbikes and cars all over the place. Whatever you did on the weekend, including mow the lawn, read the paper and have a bit of a sleep in, Townsville is a great place which values its people and whose people take pride in participating in and supporting their community. I thank the House.
