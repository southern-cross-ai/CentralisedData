        The Berry Celtic Festival, now in its ninth year, is a celebration of all things tartan. Last Saturday was clear and dry—a relief to all the organisers, especially

        , and Dorothy and Col Hanbridge—allowing the historic and specialty vehicles to go onto the Berry Showground. This was after a street parade where we waved to the wee lads, lasses and bairns, listened to the amazing sounds of 10 pipes-and-drum bands and watched the range of tartans march in unison. Thank you, Michael, for driving the Rolls-Royce so professionally.

        One Gaelic proverb says, 'What the little ones see, the little ones do.' We could see this before our eyes—the young girls in their kilts, capes and tams and the boys in their kilts, shirts and doublets proudly stepping out just like the band members around them.

        , one of our local Scotsmen, was Chieftain of the Day. For him this week was huge, as he celebrated both his 85th birthday and his 65th wedding anniversary. He opened the festival with the words 'Cead Mila Failte,' meaning a hundred thousand welcomes. I have to say, as the pipers, drummers and kilt-clad bands marched as a group to the podium, Jock needed less and less support from my arm, and as they came closer still, he sang the tune of the pipes. Being confronted by these bands in the past would have made any army turn and run. They are awe inspiring.

        Thank you,

        </a>
        of Berry, for your steadfast pursuit in raising money, initially for the Shoalhaven Cancer Care Centre, and now the Can Assist organisation. More than $145,000 has been raised and donated. I also thank my Rotary brothers and sisters, not only in Berry but also from Kiama and South Nowra. Their work and assistance always makes this community a great one.
