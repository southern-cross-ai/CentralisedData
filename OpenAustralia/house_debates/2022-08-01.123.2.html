        I wish to talk about the original teal campaignâ€”ovarian cancer and its lack of funding for research, support and treatment. Ovarian cancer has the lowest survival rate of all women's cancers, and I strongly urge the government to implement the

        National Action Plan. I recently met with two Warringah constituents, Kristin and Ruth, who have both endured extensive battles with ovarian cancer. These extraordinarily resilient women kindly shared their lived experiences and insights with me, and the extreme challenges they've faced on their own cancer journeys. These highlight the need for urgent action to improve awareness, treatment, support and survival.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day in Australia four women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and I was shocked to learn that half of women diagnosed will pass away within five years. Those who survive the threshold are rarely given the all clear. Instead, they have a looming threat of recurrent disease remaining alarmingly high. Around 70 per cent of women with advanced ovarian cancer will experience a disease recurrence within three years. It brings significant psychological impacts to patients and their families, and many experience a fear of recurrence over a sustained period of time. The ovarian cancer journey is riddled with uncertainty and mental health impacts, leading to low quality of life as those affected endure extreme medical challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2020 Ovarian Cancer Australia undertook a collaborative process of consultation with stakeholders to come up with the Ovarian Cancer National Action Plan. The plan strongly advocates for a robust improvement in ovarian cancer research; access to personalised, precision treatment; and a national commitment to decrease its incidence and improve survival rates. Ovarian Cancer Australia recommends a large-scale investment into ovarian cancer research to improve the five-year survival rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current awareness initiatives are just not good enough. Ruth and Kristin told me that many diagnoses of ovarian cancer are incidental, with symptoms often being dismissed as general discomfort. Increased awareness of symptoms will lead to early detection. It is so important that we improve all these elements of the system, and the Ovarian Cancer National Action Plan will go some way to doing that. Kristin told me: 'I'm alive today only because of clinical trials and personalised medicine. I am proof that investments in these pay off.'
       </p>
       <p>
        It's so important that we acknowledge and remember the real stories of people who are impacted by ovarian cancer. These women and their families should be seen not as mere statistics but as real Australians who are calling on us to help. These are very much the real deal when it comes to teal, and we must get behind more ovarian cancer research.
