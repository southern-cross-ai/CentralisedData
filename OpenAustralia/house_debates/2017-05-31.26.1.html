        On behalf of my local Iraqi community I want to express my condolences to the family of Zynab Al Harbiyaâ€”the 12-year-old Australian girl who was killed in Iraq while visiting her sick grandfather. I want to read out a statement from the President of the Iraqi Council Victoria, Mr Samir Kafaji:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It saddens our community that we must say goodbye to one of our own who tragically lost their lives falling victim to yet another terrorist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS" rel="nofollow">
         ISIS
        </a>
        attack overseas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Zynab Al Harbiya was a bright 12 year old from Thomastown Victoria who attended one of the northern suburbs most prestigious schools Sirius College.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She is known to be a caring and helpful young girl who was loved by her family, friends and her community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Zynab tragically lost her life to a blast claimed by a suicide bomber in an ice-cream parlour after a long day of fasting, while her uncle was badly wounded in the blast.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Zynab and her mother were in Iraq for a holiday visiting family and friends when this tragedy struck their family and others with the death toll rising.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Zynab's family and the Iraqi community mourn the loss of such a blooming flower and keep her and anyone else affected by this vicious attack in our prayers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the Iraqi council Victoria we offer our condolences to her family in Melbourne and Iraq also we would like to thank the Australian community for their continuous support and caring nature, we would also like to salute our Australian defence forces for helping keep our Australia safe and for their services supporting the brave Iraqi Security forces in defeating ISIS in Iraq.
