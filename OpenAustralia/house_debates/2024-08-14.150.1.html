        The Customs Amendment (Strengthening and Modernising Licensing and Other Measures) Bill 2024 and the Customs Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2024 form the next steps in the Albanese government's simplified trade system agenda, which will deliver a simpler, more effective and more sustainable cross-border trade environment for Australia. We all know that Australia is a trading nation. Much of our commerce and our economic growth is related to trade through international borders, and it's important that we ensure that the system operates to effectively and efficiently deliver those goods and services to Australia while, at the same time, maintaining the integrity of and protecting our borders. This bill ensures that we achieve that objective.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Customs Amendment (Strengthening and Modernising Licensing and Other Measures) Bill amends the Customs Act and the AusCheck Act to modernise and align customs processes and strengthen compliance with customs licensing. The Customs Licensing Charges Amendment Bill amends the Customs Licensing Charges Act to incorporate amendments to modernise, streamline and strengthen the calculation of depot licensing charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bills represent sensible and overdue steps to modernise Australia's customs processes. They come about as a result of the review of customs licensing regimes that was undertaken many years ago. That review reported on 31 March 2017, so it's taken some time to get this reform to the parliament, and they are long overdue. Many of these reforms will save Australian businesses time and money and will reduce the regulatory burden associated with certain customs processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments in the bills modernise customs licensing administration by allowing electronic communication methods and by streamlining licence fee processes. The amendments also align payment requirements between custom licence types, and they streamline administration across depot, warehouse and broker licences. The legislation also strengthens the customs licensing regime against threats of criminal infiltration and bolsters the efforts of the Australian Border Force to ensure integrity in our supply chains. This includes uplifting entry requirements for eligibility to hold a licence and enhanced fit and proper person checks for licensed entities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the customs amendment bill makes consequential amendments to the AusCheck Act to, among other things, permit the disclosure of information to an officer of customs for purposes under the Customs Act. The legislation will enhance the integrity of Australia's borders, which is vital for a prosperous, secure and safe Australia. The Australian Border Force will continue to consult and support businesses with their transition to these new changes. I want to thank all members who participated in the debate and I commend the bill to the House.
