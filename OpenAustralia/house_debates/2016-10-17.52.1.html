        School chaplains play an important role in schools in my electorate and right across Australia. More fondly known as 'chappies', they help students find a way to deal with issues, and these can range from family breakdowns and loneliness to depression and drug abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two thousand two hundred Australian schools are supported by chaplains. Every week, these chaplains have more than 18,000 formal conversations with students, teachers and parents. Through the social, spiritual and emotional support that chappies provide, they help students improve their overall wellbeing and, ultimately, their educational outcomes.

        I want to mention Bounty Boulevard State School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         North Lakes
        </a>
        and its chaplain, Christina Wolter. Christina, thank you for what you do. The school held a 'chappy fundraiser' last Friday. I was unable to attend but I hear it was very successful. I want to thank all the chappies in my electorate and, of course, the school communities that are working hard to help these chaplains and their important work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU" rel="nofollow">
         SU

        Queensland and all of its past and present staff for the decades of contribution that they have made to students and schools throughout Queensland. In particular, I want to say to people in my electorate: get out and support them financially if they have fundraiser. Whilst there is some government fundraising that has been in place since well before 2007 under both governments, it is important to make sure it continues.
