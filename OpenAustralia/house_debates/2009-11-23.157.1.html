       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to say a few words in thanks and recognition of the work of Dr Jacqueline Dewar, who is currently the Secretary of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which I chair, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Crime Commission
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly for us, Jacqui is leaving Canberra for a new life in Queensland after more than a decade of important public service here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . In addition to a range of roles within the secretariats of various parliamentary committees, Jacqui has also worked in the library in the Parliamentary Education Office. She has travelled in support of parliamentary delegations and she has delivered seminars on the role of committees and other parliamentary procedures through the Department of the Senate’s external seminar program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know I have been blessed in my first role as a chairperson of a parliamentary committee to have had the benefit of Jacqui’s assistance and guidance. Not only is she a lovely person but she has been the epitome of public service professionalism, always well prepared and organised. She has the knack of anticipating the kinds of issues and last minute requests for information that are part of this work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Above all, Jacqui has a genuine interest in the question of how best to advance professional ethics and law enforcement integrity. It is that combination of extreme competence with real policy engagement that has made Jacqui such a wonderful committee secretary. I am sure I speak for all parliamentarians and other parliamentary staff who have worked with Jacqui over the years in thanking her for her important contribution to our work and in wishing her and her family all the best in the future.

         A few members have indicated to me that they are wondering why we started a little bit early. For the benefit of those members, we are able to do that under the standing orders. Because members were present and ready with their 90-second statements, I took the liberty to do it.
