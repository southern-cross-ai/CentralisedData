        I was pleased to welcome the state Liberals and federal Liberal candidate at a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
         BER
        </a>
        opening recently in the north-east of Tasmania, even though the Liberal Party voted against these projects and these jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We took the right action during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
         GFC
        </a>
        to protect 200,000 jobs and to stimulate the economy. And we have the right plan now to keep the economy strong and to drive future growth for working people. We have very low public debtâ€”less than a tenth of that of those economies in difficulty in Europe; we have half their unemployment rate, with an economy that is adding jobs; and we have a massive $430 billion investment pipeline, which is a vote of confidence in the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the Leader of the Opposition acknowledged these points in London. We know that here in Australia the member for Warringah is well protected by his minders. He attends public meetings which appear to be private to prevent dissent and restrict questions. But even that protection could not hide his acknowledgement when in London of our strong economic position. The member for Warringah is not interested in policies; he just wants to play politics. That is why he wants to bring us back here next week. He should explain that to the taxpayers of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the Liberals in north-east Tasmania for their strong support for the BER projects, their strong support for the Gillard Labor government's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        and for its strong economy and fair society which obviously delivers in Tasmania.
