        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        is my home—always has been, always will be. I grew up watching the yachts on Pittwater, the rock fisherman at Long Reef, surfers and swimmers braving the elements for an early-morning dip, and the surf lifesavers who protect our beaches. Some of the fondest memories from my childhood—and the new ones I get to create now with my own daughter—involve the beach and the ocean. During the long weeks in Canberra, that is what reminds me most of home. While for some tourists it may seem like fantasy, it is just everyday life for those of us fortunate enough to live on the Northern Beaches—a life intertwined with the ocean.
       </p>
       <p>
        Much of my time since becoming the member for Mackellar has been spent reaching out to my community, meeting with constituents and finding out what is most important to them. The protection of the marine environment has been raised over and over again. Many Northern Beaches residents have taken the time to write, to call or to see me in person. I have heard you, and I am here today to represent you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our marine environment is precious and should be protected—by every level of government. As an island nation with over 10 million square kilometres of ocean we have the third-largest marine jurisdiction in the world. And as Liberals we have shown time and time again a deep commitment to protecting our ocean. It was in fact the Fraser government that established the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
        </a>
        and lobbied for its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        status.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        and Minister Robert Hill introduced the world's first oceans policy and struck agreement with state and territory governments to establish a national representative system of marine protected areas—the first of its kind in the world. Today, we have 60 marine reserves in Commonwealth waters alone, representing over 38 per cent of our oceans, the second largest area behind the United States. Over the last two decades, we have established a reputation as world leaders in marine conservation—the gold standard in protecting our marine ecosystems. This is a legacy of coalition governments, and one we are very proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        The science behind marine reserves is unequivocal. We know that they can increase the abundance and diversity of organisms, and protect threatened and vulnerable species. They allow ecosystems to recover from past natural and human impacts, safeguarding while preserving these treasures for my daughter's generation and those that follow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conservation does not just benefit the environment. Our marine reserves support a sustainable fishing industry, promote tourism and provide countless jobs in businesses small and large.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commonwealth marine reserves generally start three nautical miles from shore and extend out to the edge of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone. Whilst most of us do not directly engage with these parks, their significance and value benefit all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014, the government commenced a review of Commonwealth marine reserves to ensure these areas continue to support their objectives and strike a balance between competing usages. As part of this review process, the government will be seeking public comment on draft management plans to be released in the coming months. I encourage my community on the Northern Beaches to contribute to the review process. The finalisation of management plans will bring to a close a comprehensive review, creating certainty for all users in marine parks. I understand that the minister has requested that the Director of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks" rel="nofollow">
         National Parks
        </a>
        finalise the management plans for the reserves in the next six months, and the government will continue to work with all users on monitoring and researching projects to continually evolve our management of these reserves. In the meantime, the Turnbull government has already committed over $56 million in additional funding over four years, to strengthen the management of its marine protected areas, in order to ensure they are well managed and supported—a testament to our dedication to our marine parks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our marine environments are a precious gift. We all depend on the living ocean. It defines so much of our identity as Australians. I will continue to work with the federal and state governments to ensure these irreplaceable jewels can be preserved for all future generations. I want to keep the conversation going, keep updating you on progress and seek your feedback.
