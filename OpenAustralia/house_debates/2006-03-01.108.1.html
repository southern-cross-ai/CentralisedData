       <p>
        Today I would like to speak about the discrimination that continues to exist towards same-sex couples living in this country in 2006. I was interested recently to read an article in the
        <i>
         Sun-Herald
        </i>
        about the member for Leichhardt and his comments regarding his investigation into systemic discrimination against same-sex couples in a number of federal laws. He said, ‘I’m not interested in promoting gay marriage and I’m not interested in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras" rel="nofollow">
         Mardi Gras
        </a>
        and all that stuff; I’m only interested in equal treatment under the law.’ I think equal treatment under the law is something that as a parliament we need to devote a lot more attention to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I draw attention to Labor’s longstanding commitment to a full audit of discriminatory provisions in Commonwealth legislation. There are a number of important areas where this parliament needs to act. On this side of the House we are committed to ensuring that same-sex de facto couples have access to federal courts for resolution of property disputes under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Family Law Act
        </a>
        , a situation that does not currently exist. This is one example of many areas where same-sex couples are not getting equal treatment under the law. I have also been contacted by constituents of mine living in Unley, who have written to me about the need for the government to fulfil its promise to end discrimination against same-sex couples in public sector superannuation, another important issue and another area where we are not seeing action from the Howard government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to announce that Labor’s spokesperson on these areas, the shadow Attorney-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Roxon" rel="nofollow">
         Nicola Roxon
        </a>
        , will soon be putting forward a private member’s bill. This private member’s bill will have the purpose of prohibiting discrimination, harassment and incitement to violence on the grounds of sexuality or gender identity. I would call on the member for Leichhardt, in particular, but all members opposite, to support this important legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many other issues which the gay and lesbian community will be calling on this parliament to speak on and to act on. Obviously one that has been contentious is relationship recognition and just how the parliament is going to address this issue. I acknowledge that this is a controversial issue, and there are certainly many differing views, both within the gay and lesbian community and also within the wider society. But I do not think that means that we should just ignore the issue and think that is some sort of solution. We must begin consultations within our communities, speaking to those with strong views on the matter and finding a way forward. There are a number of different scenarios and there are a number of possibilities which the parliament will eventually need to consider.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to invite members of my own community in the electorate of Adelaide who have strong views on this issue to feel free to contact me because I would like to consult with them as our Attorney-General continues to consult on a national level. As a parliament, we must do more to address issues of discrimination towards same-sex couples. (
