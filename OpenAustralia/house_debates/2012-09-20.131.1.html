        Liberal government's decisions to cut education funding by $1.7 billion and jeopardise the future of our kids. While on one hand the federal Labor government has doubled the investment in education since 2007 and continues to work towards building a world-class education system, the New South Wales government has seen this as a green light to slash funding for public, Catholic and independent schools. And the New South Wales government has completely undermined the role of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        . The Gonski review made it clear we need to invest more to support our students and provide them with opportunities. Labor embraces this. We are determined to do what is necessary to build a world-class education system for our kids and their future.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate of Fowler happens to be the most culturally diverse in the land, yet it is also, unfortunately, one of the most disadvantaged electorates in the country. People in my electorate understand the value of education. They know that education is the thing that makes a difference for their kids and for their futures. Labor cares about this, and therefore we invest in education. Local people appreciate the investment that we have made in education. Two trade training centres—one at Bonnyrigg High School and the other at Miller Technology High School—will give students access to industry-standard equipment and vocational education, providing quality pathways into trade and helping to improve high school retention rates. This will help address skill shortages in our traditional trades. 8,500 computers have been installed in my local schools. Thanks to this investment, every high school student from years 9 to 12 will have access to the technologies they need for the future. Every local primary school has received the buildings and resources that they so desperately need: $108 million has been spent investing in 115 projects, benefiting 46 schools under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

        program in my electorate alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as it seems that education is finally receiving the attention and support it deserves, the New South Wales Liberal government has turned around and betrayed the responsibility it has to the children of New South Wales and their future. There could be no more clear contrast between the approach that the Gillard government takes to education and that of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_O'Farrell" rel="nofollow">
         Barry O'Farrell
        </a>
        and the state Liberals. The New South Wales government has turned its back on the fundamental importance that education has in our nation's future. Investing in education is a direct investment into the future workforce and our ability to be internationally competitive. Less funding will mean job cuts, fewer teachers, larger class size and fewer learning opportunities for our young people to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to have a successful future. It will have an immediate effect on fees, the curriculum and extracurricular activities that apply to all students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education, next to health, is the single most important area of investment that truly impacts on people's lives. It is certainly not an area that should be sacrificed simply to meet the Liberal party's election pledge to build the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Rail_Link" rel="nofollow">
         North West Rail Link
        </a>
        . I have personally spoken to every school principal in my electorate, and they are absolutely appalled by this development and this demeaning attitude taken to education. They have already prepared their budgets for the next school year based on the funding increases provided by the federal government, and now they are being forced to find ways to address this monstrous funding cut forced on them by the state Liberal government. This shameful move by the New South Wales Liberals is particularly painful for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , where we have lesser educational outcomes being achieved. We need more investment in education, not less.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think the principal of the Sacred Heart Primary School in Cabramatta, Mrs Margaret Hogan, summed it up best when she said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These funding cuts will particularly impact the support programs in literacy and numeracy for our students.
       </p>
       <p>
        In respect of Catholic education, she goes on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no capacity for these parents to pay more school fees, they struggle as it is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot express enough how strongly and passionately I am opposed to these ruthless cuts. Together with my Labor colleagues I will be fighting tooth and nail to force the New South Wales government to rethink this disgraceful decision.
