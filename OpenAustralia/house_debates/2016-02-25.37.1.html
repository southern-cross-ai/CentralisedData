        When the member for Warringah was unceremoniously dumped as Prime Minister, we got a new Prime Minister—one who was going to deliver new economic leadership. We were going to have a new political paradigm in here. He was going to be all things to all people—a Messiah who would change the Liberal Party. After months of a national conversation about tax reform—that our Prime Minister talked about a lot but failed to actually engage in—he ruled out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . Well, he ruled out the GST before the election; after the election, who knows?
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this new Prime Minister in question time, one minute we are in an investment seminar and the next minute we are back to the old Abbott-style smear campaign. We are swinging from one to the other. But at least the member for Warringah could run a smear campaign. This week has reminded us that this Prime Minister has serious limitations—most importantly in economic leadership. We have had the negative gearing attacks. 'Prices going up, prices going down,' says the Assistant Treasurer, and the Treasurer has absolutely nothing to say. This Prime Minister needs to find his centre. What we need from this government is a little less conversation and a little more action.
