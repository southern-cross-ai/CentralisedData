        I wish to bring to the attention of the House the outstanding success of the Tarana Community Farmers Market. Established in 2015, the community farmers market has grown from humble beginnings to a thriving monthly event with over 50 stallholders. Tarana is a tiny village situated midway between Bathurst, Lithgow and Oberon in the heart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tablelands" rel="nofollow">
         Central Tablelands
        </a>
        . The village has an interesting history, which includes tales of bushrangers such as Henry Stratton and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Norris" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Norris
        </a>
        , who held up the nearby Mutton Falls General Store in 1864. And, of course, the mythical 'Tarana Tiger' is still spoken about around the village. Many have reportedly seen it, but no-one has proved it to be fact or fiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Held on the fourth Sunday of every month around the grounds of the Tarana Rural Fire Service shed, the markets provide an opportunity to purchase products direct from local farms and kitchens where the produce is grown, livestock is raised and artisan products are made. Products range from meat to free-range eggs, fruit and vegetables, jams and preserves, cakes and sweets, breads, salami and local wines, and there are even alpacas there. The markets are run by a dedicated group of volunteers, with the money raised supporting the Tarana Rural Fire Service or other worthwhile community projects. In 2017, the committee was able to donate more than $10,000 to local projects, which included a new fridge for the fire shed, installation of a security system, a new trailer and pump for firefighting, and over $1,000 to local causes. To date, just over $9,500 has gone to local community causes.

        I'd like to make mention of the hardworking committee, including president, Jill Ross; secretary, Fay Shaw; treasurer, Annie Cook; coordinator, Lyn Webb; and committee members,

I encourage all members of this House to get out to Tarana, the amazing village in the central west, to attend the markets and enjoy their wonderful local produce. Congratulations to the amazing village of Tarana.
