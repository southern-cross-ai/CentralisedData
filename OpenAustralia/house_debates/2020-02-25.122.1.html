        railway station, travelling from Sydney to Perth. Each year, 55,000 people take this trip. It travels the equivalent of 11 times around the Earth every year. The
        <i>

        takes you from Sydney to Perth on one standard gauge of railway. It is truly an amazing thing that took our nation a little bit too long to achieve. Each year, they use 30,000 litres of milk, 37,000 serves of lamb and 22,000 bottles of wine. Back in 1912, a traveller going from Sydney to Perth had to go across six different trains. Indeed, even the Prime Minister has been on this train trip himself. He said he travelled with Elvis, otherwise known as

        . But not everyone can access this service. I want to address directly the owners of the service, Quadrant Private Equity, and say to them that they need to do more to make this an accessible service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, Ruth from Coolbinia contacted my office. Ruth is planning the trip of her lifetime. Ruth has a disability and travels with a companion to assist her with her daily tasks. When Ruth contacted Virgin Australia, they said: 'Yes, we have a disability access facilitation plan. We'll give you a 50 per cent discount for the ticket price for your companion.' Then she called Great Southern Rail, who run the
        <i>
         Indian Pacific
        </i>
        , and was told: 'No, it's full price, no assistance, no extra service for you, Ruth. No support, no special cabin, no discount.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Transperth offer free travel for support persons. Virgin, as I mentioned, provide half-price ticketing for carers. Qantas I commend as well; they say that if you're travelling with a carer, both the person travelling and their carer get a discount for their travel. Optus Stadium, on the banks of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River" rel="nofollow">
         Swan River
        </a>
        in Perth, was specifically built with 450 wheelchair positions, ACROD parking, and companion and carer ticketing available. But when it comes to Great Southern Rail and their owners, Quadrant Private Equity, there's nothing. It's disgraceful.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an iconic train that is something all Australians should be proud of. So on their 50th anniversary I am calling on them to deliver a carer discount immediately so that Ruth and so many like her can access this great and unique perspective of Australia and travel without the burden of cost just because they happen to need a carer to travel across this country. If we can standardise the gauge on our railway system, surely we can provide accessible access for all Australians.
