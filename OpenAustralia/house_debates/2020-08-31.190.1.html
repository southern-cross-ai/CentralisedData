         Aged care
        </a>
        has quite rightly been the priority of this parliament both this week and last week. I know that the experiences of our older Australians during this pandemic are front and centre in the minds of many members in this place. In the time available to me today I want to really press the government to do much more and be much more effective in the home-care side of aged-care services as well. We know that, if people are supported to stay in their own home longer, they feel more settled, have happier lives and are able to have some dignity in their life. I acknowledge the great work done by so many of our residential care providers, but home care is an important option. In my area Chris and his team at the Multicultural Communities Council of the Illawarra and Giovanna and her team at the Italian Social Welfare Organisation are delivering frontline services to help people stay in their homes, but there are still too many people waiting either to get funding for their package or to get services.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know it works. We know it's a good option. The older people in our communities deserve this. I'm saying to the government: 'Please stop taking small measures. Get on with providing a good solution to support home care.'
