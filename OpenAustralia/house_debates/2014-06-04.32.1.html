        Members opposite sometimes appear to think that you can cut the Public Service with no loss to the quality of services delivered by that Public Service. During the last parliament, I heard members opposite describe public servants as those who 'feed on others' and I heard the member for

        , joking about the fact that his Public Service cuts would drive down house prices in Canberra by driving up unemployment. Another pernicious effect of the coalition breaking its promise not to cut more than 12,000 jobs and then cutting 16,500 jobs is the impact it will have on law and order. There has never been a better time for tax dodgers and white-collar criminals as the Abbott government slashes staff at the

        and cuts resources at the

        . As ASIC chairman, Greg Metcalf has noted, 'What it means is that we do not have the luxury of doing as much proactive surveillance.' ASIC's budget will be cut by $120 million and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        's budget will be cut by $142 million. Around 3,000 jobs will be lost by the Australian Taxation Office. Those opposite talk about the rule of law but these cuts to ASIC and to the ATO will lead to the law of the jungle. If those opposite were faced with a government that was taking police off the streets, they would say it would increase crime. But they are taking away those who enforce our tax laws and our corporations law. As a result, Australian corporate crime and tax avoidance may well rise.
