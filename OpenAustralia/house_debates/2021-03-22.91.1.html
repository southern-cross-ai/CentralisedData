        My question as to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services. Will the minister update the House on what the Morrison government is doing to ensure the delivery of essential government services to support Australians impacted by the flooding events in

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. I think the whole House's thoughts and prayers are not just with the member's constituents but with all those people really being affected by the terrible flooding. Suffice to say, the Morrison government is absolutely committed to supporting people impacted by these natural disasters and Services Australia will play a key role supporting and providing services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Services Australia are now providing two relief payments for those impacted. Firstly, The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment, or the AGDRP, provides a one-off lump sum of $1,000 per adult for eligible adults and $400 for each eligible child under the age of 16. Secondly, the Disaster Recovery Allowance,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRA" rel="nofollow">
          DRA
         </a>
         , is a 13-week income support payment to assist individuals who can demonstrate they've lost income as a result of the disaster. It is important for Australians to know that they don't need to go in to a service centre to receive support, noting that all Services Australia service centres are openâ€”bar one at this stage, being
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
          Port Macquarie
         </a>
         . Australians simply need to call 1800 22 66. Lines will be open from 8am until 8 pm. As at 2 pm today 9,200 people impacted have been calling through to those lines. Services Australia has almost 700 staff dedicated on to those phone lines to ensure Australians can get the assistance they need. Those lies will be open from 8 am until 8 pm and they'll be open seven days a week to ensure all Australians can get the services they need.
        </p>
        <p>
         Services Australia is also using the government's new payment platform to make these emergency payments, which means those eligible applicants will receive the money into their bank accounts within an hour in 95 per cent of the time. So call 1800 22 66 and those eligible will be paid quickly. Likewise in all disasters, especially like those in

          Black Summer
         </a>
         , the mobile service centres and mobile service teams of Services Australia are ready to deploy and pre-position when it is safe to do so to ensure that all Australians can access what they need. The mobile service centres, as many rural and regional members of the House would know, provide a full capability and full walk-in service centre.
        </p>
        <p>
         The House should also be aware that we have now paused all relevant debts for a six-month period in all of the declared
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
          LGA
         </a>
         s through to 22 September. Australians don't need to do anything at all. That pause has already occurred. But Australians can always contact Services Australia should they wish to discuss any individual circumstances. Services Australia will also be providing social workers and other support and counselling as required. This is the key message for all Australians: 1802266 is the number to call for emergency payment assistance.
