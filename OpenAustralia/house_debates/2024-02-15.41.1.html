        SMITH (â€”) (): Courtney Leiba led a large and impressive life. He was born in Trinidad, where he became an accomplished musician, particularly mastering the steel drums. He was a member of the Esso Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band, playing at the world expo in Montreal in 1967. It was while performing there that the band caught the attention of the great Liberace. The band then toured with Liberace across the United States and even played on

        . They were so well received that Courtney and his band were nominated for a Grammy Award. He brought his talents here, teaching and playing the steel drums around Canberra.

        Courtney was a committed political activist, first running for public office back in Trinidad many years ago. Here in Canberra, Courtney was a committed trade unionist and a long-term member of the

        . I was proud last year to witness him becoming a life member of our great party. His life was motivated and driven by his values. But the most important part of the story of his life came nearly 50 years ago, when, in Trinidad, he met a young volcanologist and seismologist from Tasmania.

        Courtney and Marion were married for 47 years and made a wonderful family. My thoughts go out to Marion, Nadine, Kenrick and all the Leiba grandkids. Vale, Courtney Leiba.
