        I rise this afternoon to highlight one of the many fantastic businesses in my electorate who stepped up to the plate during the recent health crisis.

        Spirits is a small craft distillery located in Cairns and is more used to quenching people's thirst through its signature rum product, Croc Piss. When the pandemic hit and the supply chain was disrupted, there was a call to arms by government for local industry to step up. FNQ Spirits' owner, Troy Read, answered the call and started produced much-needed hand sanitiser for our local community. Troy had no hesitation in investing his own money to support our local community in this time of need. FNQ Spirits sold large volumes of hand sanitiser to the general public and to military personnel, along with community and volunteer organisations, throughout the pandemic. Stock has flown off the shelves. In fact, he's making 400 litres a week, using local sugar cane.

        However, when the supply chain was restored, people started reverting to cheaper productsâ€”imported brands. A call to arms from the paper saw the locals remember. However, the same call needs to be heeded by government at all levels: support businesses that were encouraged to diversify, and ensure that their products are included in government preferred lists. We've done it in Cairns. The local community certainly stepped up when the chips were down, and FNQ Spirits is doing exceptionally well there. But I'd like to see it happen in government.
