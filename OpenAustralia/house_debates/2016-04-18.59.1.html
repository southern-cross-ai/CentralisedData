       <p>
        I rise today to speak about a remarkable nine-year-old girl called Tia Brennen who lives in Minto in my electorate of Macarthur. When Tia was away with her family at a caravan park near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex_Inlet" rel="nofollow">
         Sussex Inlet
        </a>
        over the Christmas holidays, she saw a pile of bikes dumped by some rubbish bins and asked her mum, Clarissa, whether she could take them home and give them to kids without a bike in her community. Tia's mum explained that there was not enough car space for a load of old bikes. But Tia refused to forget about her idea and, when she got home, she persuaded her mum, dad and sister Harmony to search for bikes at council pick-ups and throughout the local area. When a bike is discovered, Tia and Harmony help their dad, Simon, to clean them up, replace broken parts and repair the bikes to good working order.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tia had the foresight to create a Facebook site called 'Tell Tia for Charity—recycled bikes for kids' which allows the community in Minto to post information on abandoned bikes and spread the word on this terrific idea. Tia has received the help and support of numerous local organisations, including

        Campbelltown, which acts as a drop-off point for the bikes. The

        </a>
        and 'Minto on the Go' are all giving Tia a hand by collecting and delivering bikes, donating helmets and accessories, and advertising in the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        So far Tia and her family have collected 50 bikes—a truly amazing achievement. Recently Tia saw a couple of young children riding around on bikes she had recycled and she said it was like seeing a miracle. Tia, your generosity and kind heartedness in someone so young is truly remarkable and I wish you every success with Tell Tia. You are an extraordinary young lady. I wish you all the best for the future. Well done.
