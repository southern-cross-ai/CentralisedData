        My question is to the Minister for Regional Development,

         Local Government
        </a>
        and Territories. How is the Albanese Labor government maximising job opportunities in regional Australia through its Powering Australia plan?

         I thank the member for Bendigo for her question and congratulate her on her re-election—another amazing region in our nation. It is clear that only an Albanese Labor government is committed to taking ambitious action on climate change. Through our Powering Australia plan we will deliver more jobs to regional Australia, which is close to my heart and should be a passion for everyone across this chamber. Five out of every six jobs created through our Powering Australia plan will be in the regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my home of Eden-Monaro we see every type of renewable energy you can think of. It does wonderful things for our regions. It creates an economic boost. It brings jobs and technology into our regions. We know that the benefits are going to be duplicated right across this country. Our plan ensures that there will be a clean energy industry right across this nation and that we will prioritise the decarbonisation of existing industries. Our plan will prioritise investment and growth in the regions, which have long been Australia's energy engine room.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are providing certainty to business and industry, most importantly—certainty that hasn't existed for business and industry under the decade of those opposite when they were in government. We want to harness the partnership with our communities and with local government, because we know that there will be growth opportunities that will come from maximising renewable energy in our regions.
        </p>

          Regional Australia
         </a>
         will continue to power our nation. It will continue to provide a stream of exports into the future, because we know here that our climate emergency is regional Australia's jobs opportunity. It's part of our government's pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050. This side of the House takes seriously the need to reduce carbon emissions. This side of the House takes seriously the need to take action on climate change. And this side of the House takes seriously the need to boost and grow jobs in regional Australia.
