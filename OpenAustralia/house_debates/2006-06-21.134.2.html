       <p>
        In the Australian parliament today I wish to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Combet
        </a>
        . On 12 June 2006 Greg Combet was awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , or an AM. It was a richly deserved award for a man still in his youthful years who has already contributed so much to the Australian community. The award was for service to industrial relations and work for the victims of asbestos related diseases which arose out of the James Hardie scandal. Obviously those victims are very grateful for the work that Greg has done with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Banton" rel="nofollow">
         Bernie Banton
        </a>
        . The compensation fund that had been created by James Hardie was clearly inadequate to properly compensate the families of the victims of asbestos related diseases. Greg performed those duties in securing decent compensation in his capacity as Secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
         ACTU
        </a>
        , a position that he has now held for several years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The striking feature of Greg Combet is his good values. He is always committed to protecting the vulnerable in our society. Greg is committed to the basic rights of working people. He is committed to the rights of working people to bargain collectively and to be represented by a union and he is committed to the concept of freedom of association. Having said that, Greg understands very well the business imperatives of achieving efficiency and profitability and understands that we need profitable businesses to create employment. He is therefore a union official more in the consensus mould, following the sort of example set by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        . But, if Greg is put in a position where he needs to protect the vulnerable, he will fight very hard for themâ€”just ask the asbestos victims.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you do take on Greg Combet, do not expect him to crumble under pressure; he will not. He is very resolute and a great advocate for working people. Greg plays the guitar and he keeps Gouldian finches at his home. In the middle of winter I am sure they are pretty cold little Gouldian finches, but, as Greg has said, in the Combet household you have to be tough, and those are tough finches. I also acknowledge his partner, Petra; daughter, Anna; and stepchildren. It is a beaut family. Greg has made and will continue to make a wonderful contribution to our society.
