        Thirty-six thousand five hundred days ago the local post office opened in Toora. I was there for the 100th anniversary celebration. I received a very special thank you card:

       <p class="italic">
        Thank you so much for your support of our local post office. It is very much appreciated as is your attendance today to celebrate our centenary.

        What a day it was at the celebration of the Toora post office. We enjoyed together the company of the local Toora primary school students, and every one of them had designed a coloured stamp of their own.

        came down and made a great presentation, which was a lovely prize, to the student who won the best stamp. It was a great day for all of us, but the thanks should have gone to
