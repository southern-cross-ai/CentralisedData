        My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of his promise in 2007 to take, ‘A very hard line, a very tough line on people smuggling’. Prime Minister, with 24 boats and over 1,200 unauthorised arrivals in just the past 10 weeks, isn’t your hollow promise of 2007 just the latest example of a government which is all talk and no action?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the honourable member of the following in response to his question: the highest number of boats arriving in Australia in any one year was, in fact, in the year 1999 when 3,700 asylum seekers arrived on 86 boats. That is one measure. The highest number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia in any one year was in 2001 under the previous Howard government.

           In response to the honourable member who refers I believe to recent statistics, in November 1999 there were 14 boat arrivals—the highest number of boats in any one month on record. This was followed by a further 10 arrivals in December 1999. I refer to a quote from the then minister who said that in the period following:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … 1 November 1999, 29 boats and 2 245 people have arrived illegally in Australia, mostly from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           and the sub continent.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the Leader of the Opposition asks questions about the effectiveness of government policy at different times and under different security circumstances, I would draw his attention to the historical record of his own party when in government. Furthermore, in response to the Leader of the Opposition’s question, firstly, the Australian government has more naval and air assets patrolling our borders than any other government. Secondly, we are investing more in international and regional action to counter people smuggling than any other government. Thirdly, we have arrested more people smugglers than any other government, I am advised, with 117 arrests of which 89 are currently before the courts. Fourthly, I am advised that under this government we are seeing more people-smuggling ventures disrupted than under any other government.
          </p>
          <p>
           I say to those opposite that the responsibility of any elected government of Australia is to take appropriate action in response to whatever global security circumstances and regional security circumstances present to that government at the time. Mr Howard when he was Prime Minister did so in the surge in people-smuggling activity which occurred in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This government is doing so today in response to the challenges which have, in particular, arisen from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
            Sri Lanka
           </a>
           . In response to the Leader of the Opposition, this government will continue to take a responsible approach in dealing with the challenge of people smuggling and those who are found not to be genuine asylum seekers will be sent back home as, in fact, we have already done in a number of cases.
