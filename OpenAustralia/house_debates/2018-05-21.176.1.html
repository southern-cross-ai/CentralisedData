       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of calling the president of Palmyra Drag Racing Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Cunningham" rel="nofollow">
         Glenn Cunningham
        </a>
        , to let him know the club was successful in obtaining $20,000 through the Stronger Communities grant program. Having only barely recovered from severe flood damage in 2012, Palmyra Dragway, like many others, was drastically damaged by the fierce Tropical Cyclone Debbie last year. Unfortunately, the state Labor government rejected the club's cries for disaster funding, and they were deemed ineligible to receive disaster assistance due to part of the club being outside of their boundary requirements.

        also rejected my request for a revision of the cut-off as this not-for-profit club was facing big costs with little assistance. This, too, fell on deaf ears. I was therefore ecstatic to be able to offer my support and assistance with funding through the Stronger Communities funding stream. Palmyra Dragway is an important sporting facility in my electorate. Built in 1967, it's the oldest drag-racing venue in Australia. Palmyra Dragway has been a local haven for car-racing enthusiasts and spectators alike, with over 50,000 people visiting the track from all over the country.

        There are many not-for-profit clubs in Australia like Palmyra Dragway who face ongoing struggles, but the volunteers stay dedicated and hang in there. They tough out the hard times and continue to grow and develop their clubs and their facilities. I'm proud of the way the communities of Capricornia support organisations like this, and I wish the Palmyra Dragway club all the success for future projects.
