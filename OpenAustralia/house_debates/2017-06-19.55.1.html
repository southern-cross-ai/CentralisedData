        There is a chronic shortage of doctors in country Australia. The proposed Murray Darling Medical School aims to fix this problem. There is currently a review on the issue being undertaken by the firm of Ernst &amp; Young, which has been engaged by federal departments. I have some concerns about the way this review is occurring. Firstly, the terms of reference appear to be very narrow. I have suggested terms of reference which seek an examination of the effectiveness of the current system of medical training—which, unfortunately, have not been accepted. Another concern I have is that the Ernst &amp; Young officers carrying out the review do not appear to be consulting or meeting with any community groups or community members from the Murray-Darling region. This is a deeply troubling development that will be viewed with alarm across the country communities of the west. I am therefore calling on all of our communities to contact Ernst &amp; Young to make their voices heard. The contact details for the review will be posted on my Facebook page, and I would encourage everyone who has an interest in this vitally important issue, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        —and you do not want to be messing with the CWA!—to service clubs to men's sheds, to make a submission to Ernst &amp; Young. If those submissions are not accepted by Ernst &amp; Young, send copies to my office, and I will bring them to the attention of this parliament. Country communities are tired of the inequality between the city and the bush. The time for the Murray Darling Medical School has come, and we will not give up on this. We will not be backing down.
