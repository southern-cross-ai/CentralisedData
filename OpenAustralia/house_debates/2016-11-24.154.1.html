        As we mark White Ribbon Day this week we have been reminded of the precariousness and vulnerability of those who have to leave the home they know to flee to safety or who simply have no permanent roof over their head. The two issues—one bravely raised by the member for Lindsay and the other under scrutiny in both her electorate and my own in Macquarie—are inextricably linked. I want to congratulate the member for Lindsay. She knows her fellow parliamentarians from both sides are here to support here.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to congratulate those involved in the Ending Homelessness Here project being done in both of our neighbouring electorates, in the local government areas of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">

        , Hawkesbury and Penrith. Led by Wentworth Community Housing, who recently marked their 20th anniversary, in partnership with Platform Youth Services and

        and supported by the Mercy Foundation, the team of staff and volunteers surveyed local homeless individuals and families. Registry week involves speaking to people in the early hours of the morning, during the day, on streets, in bushland, in parks and in temporary accommodation. It also involved meeting the last train arriving at

        at the top of the Blue Mountains, as the trains sometimes provide the only shelter late into the night. Seventy-eight individuals and families were surveyed. They were either homeless or vulnerably accommodated.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the concerning findings was that over one-third of people experiencing homelessness in our community have serious medical conditions, combined with mental health and drug and alcohol conditions. More than half had spoken to a mental health professional in the last six months. More than half had experienced trauma of some sort. The survey shows the cost to the health system in the previous six months of emergency department admissions, ambulance transport and hospitalisations was a quarter of a million dollars. This is for 78 individuals. As the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heading_Home" rel="nofollow">
         Heading Home
        </a>
        team says, to be able to provide regular health-care rather than expensive emergency health-care would be a much better spend and leave significant funds to address the individuals' housing needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another of the findings was that when it came to people 55 years and over, the Hawkesbury had the highest percentage who were homeless, at nearly 20 per cent. This research comes at a time when the Equality Rights Alliance warns that there is a tsunami of older women facing homelessness. Single women over the age of 45 on low-to-medium incomes living in private rental accommodation are at risk of future homelessness. In the electorate of Macquarie the latest data has more than 1,400 women in that category. Already, 40 per cent of older women are not able to be assisted when seeking short-term or emergency accommodation, and only 11 per cent are able to be helped to find long-term accommodation. That is now. It is only going to get worse if we fail to act. Women are particularly affected because of, among other things, gender-based financial inequality throughout their life and, of course, family violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Safe, secure and affordable housing is fundamental. The Ending Homelessness Here project has a principle of housing first, unconditionally, no matter the issues. Housing provides stabilisation. It gives you a roof over your head, a shower, a place to eat and an address. They are looking at innovative solutions—local ones that fit our community. I wish them well for the second phase of their project.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also need national engagement. The National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness ends in seven months. A decision on the future is due to be made after this parliament rises in December. The national partnership provides up to 30 per cent of the budget of homelessness services across the country. At risk are crisis accommodation for women and children seeking safety, assistance with finding long-term housing, early intervention programs for families at risk of becoming homeless, programs to reconnect homeless youth with their families and referrals to employment and other support services. All of these are vital as part of a package of things that we need to make sure we end homelessness.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is only one choice for this government to make if they are serious about tackling family violence, tackling poverty and tackling homelessness. The government need to recommit. They need to recommit to the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness and provide long-term, predictable, stable funding. Right now there are workers who do not know if they will have a program to work on from the middle of next year. Seven months is such a tight time frame. What we tend to see from this government is gap funding. That will not cut it. This needs a long-term commitment and we need it now.
