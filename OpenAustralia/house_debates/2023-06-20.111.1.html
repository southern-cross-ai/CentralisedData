        Today I rise to acknowledge East Coast Beverages, which is an exceptional juice and beverage company operating on the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . East Coast Beverages was started in 1965 by Salvatore Lentini, who began the business by growing citrus in Kulnura. Mr Lentini then went on to vend his produce at the famous Flemington markets, selling East Coast Beverages' Australian grown citrus produce to the wider Sydney community. Fast forward to the present day, and East Coast Beverages is a booming enterprise employing over 50 Central Coast locals. East Coast Beverages has kept true to its roots, with three generations of Lentinis having been involved in the organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I was invited to visit and tour East Coast Beverages. I got to see firsthand the operations that take place at its beverage manufacturing facility in Kulnura. I was warmly greeted by managing director, Samuel Lentini, who provided an insightful overview of operations, including a tour of the robotics that process the fruit, bottle and prepare products to be sent to its retailers in Australia and even overseas. It was also an opportunity to meet with several employees who ensure the smooth operations of that facility. I would like to thank them for their work and patience while I visited their workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        East Coast Beverages pride themselves on minimising the organisation's environmental footprint, and I was very impressed with their sustainability focus to 'return, regrow and reduce'. What this mantra means is that all products are recyclable. Water used in the beverage manufacturing facility is treated and reused to irrigate the citrus areas. Lastly, citrus pulp is sent to other businesses to make citrus infused yoghurts and desserts. There has been a tremendous effort to reduce the environmental footprint of the business and solve a range of other issues along the way. I was also impressed to learn that East Coast Beverages transports citrus pulp and other organic matter to drought affected farmers to feed their cattle and other livestockâ€”a very generous service to our Australian farmers.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the brilliant Lentini family, I commend you all on your commitment to East Coast Beverages and on continuing to call the Central Coast home. East Coast Beverages is one of the Central Coast's most respected and recognisable family owned businesses, and this is testament to the dedication that you all have to its ongoing success. To Salvatore Lentini and his three sons, Sam, Mick and Frank, and their wives, Nina, Maria and Rosa, as well as third-generation Lentini family members, Samuel, Sammy and Dominic: well done and thank you for all that you do for our Central Coast family. Lastly, to the whole team at East Coast Beverages: keep up the outstanding work!
