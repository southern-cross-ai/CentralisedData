        Technology has transformed all our lives enormously in recent times. Many of us in this chamber can remember the first time we brought a personal computer into our homes and the first time we logged on to the internet. The changes, the jobs and the transformation of our society from things like that have been enormous. In fact, McKinsey calculates that 20 per cent of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

        has arisen just from the businesses now associated with the internet.

        My electorate of Page is willing and happy and is embracing this new technology. The local

        , together with business and local chambers, households and government, have developed a new digital strategy for our local economy. The digital revolution is disruptive. Businesses now often have to compete with people who are not even in their local environment. There are, however, many opportunities that arise from this type of transformation as well, and there are many industries and many businesses within Page—creative industries—that are embracing this.

        One example I would like to share is from mememe productions, headed by creatives Cate McQuillan and Hewey Eustace, who have created—you may have seen it, Deputy Speaker—the famous

        television show, which won an international Digital Emmy in April this year. They are very creative people. In fact, in a previous life they were the singers at my wedding—known then as the 'Two Pot Screamers'! And they did a great job that night, too—it was a very enjoyable evening. And I am still married, by the way, too, so that was good money well spent on them!
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked if the show could have been developed and produced in the city, Cate replied with an emphatic no.

         Digital Economy

        Strategy is based on seven key principles to meet the digital revolution. The first is leadership. Local leaders, and we have many, are inspiring others in the early adoption of this technology by embracing new work practices and business models. The second is openness in collaboration. Digital technology has dramatically changed how we manage our business and organisations. We no longer work in isolation. The third is communication and awareness. We need to make business and the general community aware of technologies that are available for them, the costs and how best they can use them. The fourth principle is digital inclusion. Participation of some members of our community may be at risk due to age, income, ethnicity, gender, education level, disability or where they live. The strategy is designed to ensure that all members can participate and benefit from the digital economy. Principles 5, 6 and 7 are digital knowledge transfer, innovation and creativity, access and—
