       <p>
        Yesterday afternoon, I had the great pleasure of attending the Wanniassa Preschool Family Fun Day, another 40th birthday celebration.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         The Valley
        </a>
        is turning 40! The preschool is part of the Wanniassa school network that essentially runs from P right through to 10—the junior school and the preschool, as well as the senior school. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the P&amp;C. It is a small P &amp; C—four fabulous women—so it is a quality not quantity P &amp; C. But they put on a great day.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were cakes stalls and the sausage sizzle, of course, as well as a whole range of other activities for the people who attended. There were former teachers and former students. One of the highlights of the day for me was cutting the glorious cake that had been produced and donated by one of the mothers. The cake featured the Rainbow Unit, which is the Wanniassa preschool. The Rainbow Unit consists of the penguins, the turtles and the dolphins. The beauty about this preschool is that it is the Rainbow Unit for many reasons, one of which being that it has a Koori preschool as well as a preschool for other students.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was just a wonderful day. Again, I congratulate and thank the P &amp; C. I also want to take the opportunity to thank the Tuggeranong United Football Club life members who made Saturday night such a great night.
