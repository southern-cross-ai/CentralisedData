        A few weekends ago I went down to the racetrack at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Olympic_Park" rel="nofollow">

        to watch members of RaceRunning Australia train. Racerunning, or frame running, is a game-changer for people with a disability. The specially designed three-wheeled frame supports participants to run on their feet independently. Developed in Denmark, the running frames were developed for people with cerebral palsy to help them run and keep active. It took a determined father to bring the frames to Australia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Keith" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Keith
        </a>
        discovered a frame running in 2018 at a triathlon competition for children with cerebral palsy. His eight-year-old son, Arran, was participating in the competition and was relying on a cumbersome walking frame for the run leg. It was here that Richard discovered running frames. Richard talks about the first moment he saw his son using the running frameâ€”seeing his freedom of movement and speed and the joy he showed in being able to run for the first time. It was a moment that brought him to tears.

        Frame running has taken hold here, and there are now nine running groups across Australia, giving people with a disability exercise, self-confidence and access to a wonderful community. The story of frame running demonstrates how adjustments and technology can ensure that all people have access to sports and exercise.
