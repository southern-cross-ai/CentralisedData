        On indulgence, today is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Sir
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bradman" rel="nofollow">
         Donald Bradman
        </a>
        , Australia’s greatest sportsman. His contribution to cricket is unrivalled. He represented Australia for 20 years, playing 52 tests from the 1928-29 season through until 1948, and he finished his test career with a remarkable batting average of 99.94. No-one else has ever come close to this. I suspect no-one else ever will.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman" rel="nofollow">
         Don Bradman
        </a>
        was born at Cootamundra, and he quickly developed his cricketing skills. He made his first-class debut at the age of 19 and not long after became the youngest player to score a test century for Australia. He soon became not just Donald Bradman but ‘the Don’. During the tough years of the Depression he was a hero at home and a great source of national pride during difficult times. Years later, after the

        </a>
        , he led the Australian team on its famous 1948 tour of England.

       <p>
        Don achieved more than any other player in cricket. Don Bradman was absolutely dedicated to the game he loved and a consummate professional. He was continually looking to improve his game. He inspired people during the years of the Depression as he continues to inspire people today.

         On indulgence, I join with the Prime Minister in celebrating and recognising the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great Sir
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bradman" rel="nofollow">
          Donald Bradman
         </a>
         , the greatest sportsman in any sport and any era, as far as I am concerned.

          Sir Donald Bradman

         of Australia was beyond any argument, according to the cricketing bible
         <i>
          Wisden
         </i>
         , ‘the greatest batsman who ever lived and the greatest cricketer of the 20th century’. He made 6,996 runs in 52 tests for an average of 99.94. To put that into some perspective, Bradman’s average is more than 30 per cent higher than the next best average, which is 68.38, of all of the cricketers who have ever played the game. He was just four runs short of averaging 100.
        </p>
        <p>
         His name and what he achieved was so far out of the reach of any player in his time or any player who has played since, it is almost like he played a different game from what we are playing, as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         said only yesterday. The newspaper posters of the day said, amongst other things, ‘Bradman bats and bats and bats’ and ‘Bradman versus England’.

         evening newspaper blazoned just two words across its front page: ‘He’s out’. Someone had finally managed to dismiss him. But in the end it was not the numbers; it was the man. We celebrate the life of Sir Donald Bradman and the inspiration that he provided and provides to our nation. This evening there will be a significant event in Sydney to celebrate his life, his achievements and his legacy.
