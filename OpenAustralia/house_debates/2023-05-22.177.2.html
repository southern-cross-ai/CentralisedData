        In 2021, the three Labor MPs in the Peel region promised big on health care.

        , Lisa Munday and Robyn Clarke were elected promising to fix our local hospital and have even dubbed themselves the 'dream team'. The truth is they've been a vision of incompetence and low energy. I've stood here many times to expose the appalling mismanagement of the Peel Health Campus by WA Labor. But last Friday Labor's negligence was on full display. Patients were diverted from the hospital after black mould was found in the aircon system and—surprise, surprise—the dream team remained silent. This is unacceptable.

        I've called on Premier Mark McGowan and his MPs to do their jobs and deliver urgent upgrades to our hospital, as they promised. They've had 6½ years. People are at their wits' end; they have had enough of the second-rate excuses about why works haven't started yet. That was why, on Saturday, almost 300 frustrated locals joined me and the WA state Liberal leader, Libby Mettam, at my health forum. Libby and I listened to worried locals tell us about the struggles they have faced at the Peel Health Campus because of Labor's delays and inaction. The message was loud and clear: Mike McGowan and WA Labor have let us down, but we won't give up. We won't stop fighting until we have a hospital fit for purpose to meet the needs of our community. So from this chamber, I thank the locals who attended. I thank the nurses and healthcare workers who attended and shared their voice to inform better public policy making in
