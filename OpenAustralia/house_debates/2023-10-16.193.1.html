       <p>
        On Saturday our country had an opportunity to take another step towards reconciliation, but the nation indicated that it was not yet ready to do so. This time is a particularly difficult one for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        in our community and around the country. We have to recognise, acknowledge and respect their hurt and their disappointment.
       </p>

        But while our country voted against the Voice, Kooyong voted strongly in favour of it. Our rejection of cynical politics in favour of a more generous and inclusive Australia was reflected in the more than 700 incredible volunteers who dedicated hundreds of hours to achieving this result. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them in this chamber. Thank you to everyone who knocked on a door, letterboxed their neighbourhood, helped out at prepoll, worked on a polling booth or hosted a corflute. You put your heart and soul into something in which we all truly believed, and you embodied the community spirit of Kooyongâ€”so much so that today a 'no' campaign volunteer emailed my office to share his appreciation at the kindness and respect that our volunteers showed on Saturday. He said: 'Contrary to my concerns, everyone I met throughout the day was a pleasure to stand beside and to speak with, regardless of our differing views. There was no animosity or unpleasantness. It was a credit to the Kooyong campaign.' That's Kooyong. That's our community. Thank you.
