        I'd like to take this opportunity to speak about an important program in Capricornia. Applications for the Liberal-National government's Stronger Communities Program are open, and I strongly urge all eligible community organisations and councils in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQ" rel="nofollow">
         CQ
        </a>
        to apply. Communities in Capricornia will have the opportunity to share in $150,000 of federal funding to improve local infrastructure and provide essential community equipment. This would fund up to 20 projects in Capricornia, with grants of between $2,500 and $20,000 available. This program has achieved tremendous outcomes across Capricornia in previous rounds, with so many local organisations receiving funding.

        In Rockhampton we've secured over $17,000 for the Frenchville Sports Club to install a digital scoreboard, over $13,000 CentacareCQ to construct new consultation rooms and a gym, over $9,000 for

        of Capricorn Coast to go towards their Mulambin Beach park facilities. In Sarina we've had over $15,000 for the Sarina rugby club to install new grandstand shading, and over $10,000 for Sarina Surf Lifesaving Club to purchase a new inflatable rescue boat.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Middlemount we've had more than $18,000 for C&amp;K Middlemount Community Childcare Centre to purchase and upgrade their outdoor play equipment. In Collinsville $10,000 was delivered to St Vincent de Paul to purchase and install a solar power system at the Collinsville retail centre, and in Clermont over $2,000 for Clermont Men's Shed to purchase a new versatile toolbox. I recently visited the Frenchville Sports Clubs and met with general manager Damien Massingham to see their brand new scoreboard. It looks fantastic.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I always say, it takes a lot of sausage sizzles for any club to raise the money needed to make upgrades and to purchase new equipment. I am thrilled that we have opened another round of funding, which will support even more projects here in

        . Communities can rest assured that our government is with them every step of the way as we recover from the challenges of 2020. Applications open on 19 January this year, and expressions of interest must be in by this Friday 5 February. Applications close on Monday 22 March. Community organisations can get further information on my website. Thank you.
