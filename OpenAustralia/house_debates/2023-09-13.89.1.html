         Early Childhood Education
        </a>
        . How is the Albanese Labor government working for Australian families by delivering practical cost-of-living relief by making early learning more affordable?

         I thank the member for Spence for his question. I particularly want to make note of his unwavering advocacy for families and children in Spence and the fact that 7,200 families in Spence have benefited from our reforms introduced in the parliament last year to make early childhood education and care more affordable by raising the Child Care Subsidy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, when our Prime Minister stood on the other side there and made more affordable early learning a key commitment of a Labor government, he did that because he knew it was the right thing to do, and, from the day that we took office, we have been working for Australia to deliver on that commitment because, as a government, we know that it was the right thing to do. It was the right thing for children, giving them every single opportunity to thrive and giving them those transformational benefits of early learning. It was the right thing to do for the economy, boosting productivity and increasing workforce participation, particularly for women. It was the right thing to do for the country, laying the foundations for a better future. And, of course, it was the right thing to do for families, for whom the cost of early learning and care is a significant factor when they do their household budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our changes provide those families with real and responsible cost-of-living relief, easing the pressure on their family budgets. It's practical relief that's making a real difference to Australian families.

            As someone who relied on early learning to provide myself and my family the opportunity, in my case, to undertake paid work and to study while I raised my two sons, I know just how important early childhood education and care is. The fact is that, without those early childhood educators and without access to affordable early childhood learning and care, I would not be standing here today. I want more families to benefit from affordable early learning so that they can reach their aspirations, so that their children can thrive, so that they can pursue opportunities. That's what everyone on this side wants for Australian families. That's why our government is working for Australia, taking practical action that takes that pressure off Australian families. It's working for Australia by putting the needs of Australian families first, with a focus on cost-of-living relief that doesn't add to inflation, because we know it's the right thing to do.
