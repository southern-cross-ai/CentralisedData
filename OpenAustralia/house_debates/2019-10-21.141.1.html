        I rise to congratulate the City of Mandurah
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        sub-branch on the opening of their new premises in Greenfields, Mandurah. I visited the club while it was under construction and enjoyed its official opening on Anzac Day this year, and it looks great. After two years without a permanent home, it's satisfying to see the City of Mandurah RSL with their own home again. Thanks and recognition must go to the Mandurah Bowling and Recreation Club, who hosted the RSL during their sojourn. I'm pleased to note the assistance of the Morrison government by way of an $8,400 grant for the installation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        , alarms and lighting. This was an important part of the new build. It's great to see the government getting alongside the City of Mandurah RSL. It may seem a small thing but it did make a difference for the sub-branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also pleased to recently present the Mandurah RSL with some modern memorabilia. A little while ago they approached me for some memorabilia that would reflect younger veterans' experiences and would also help complete the historical narrative. Of course, we celebrate

        I want to note for the chamber that the City of Mandurah RSL has also been successful in its application for a further $4,870 under the federal government's Building Excellence in Support and Training grant program. The government provided $4.115 million nationally under the most recent round of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEST" rel="nofollow">
         BEST
        </a>
        grants scheme, which is divided proportionally among the ex-service organisations that apply. The BEST grants are important as part of the commitment to support ex-service organisations and our contribution towards the costs incurred in providing advocacy services to the veteran communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to congratulate Mr Dave Mabbs as the newly elected president of the City of Mandurah RSL. Dave has been an active member of the sub-branch for many years and is a fine choice for this position. I particularly want to note his service every Anzac and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        organising official events. I also acknowledge the outgoing president, Mr Brian Dillon, for his service and leadership in this role through a very busy and demanding time for the sub-branch. Congratulations to Dave and Brian for their service, both to our country and uniform but also to our local community through the Mandurah RSL sub-branch.
