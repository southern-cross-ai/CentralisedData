        I'm really passionate about the electorate of Petrie, which I represent. It's a great community with wonderful people, wonderful places and wonderful organisations that support our community. One such organisation is Aspleycare, which is at Aspley, of course. It operates at the edge of my electorate and in my electorate. It has been operating since 1979. This year I was really pleased to join them for their 40th anniversary. Forty years is a great achievement. Established in 1979 by Father Gerry McSweeney and

        , Aspleycare has grown to become an institution in our region that cares for the most vulnerable. Aspleycare is a parish based group of volunteers who service our local community by responding to the needs of people in a neighbourly, practical way whilst providing assistance to those who need it most.
       </p>
       <p>
        The breadth of what Aspleycare does in our community is immeasurable, but I'll try to sum it up in these few minutes. With the help of their valuable volunteers, Aspleycare supports locals in need by offering food parcels; vouchers; assistance with bills, if families need it; medical prescriptions; and referrals to other agencies. Volunteers also conduct what most locals look forward to the mostâ€”Aspleycare's Thursday outing. These outings assist people with socialisation, keeping them in touch with the community and making friends. As we know, life is about relationships, so making friends and building relationships is really important. In modern Australia this is especially important, as loneliness and exclusion are on the rise, especially amongst senior Australians. They also assist with providing respite for carers and families of people with disabilities. This is especially important today, given that it is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with Disability. On the third Thursday of every month, volunteers offer morning tea and entertainment during the outing. As well as taking part in the outings and providing the fun, volunteers provide one of the most important parts of the outing, and that is the transport to enable locals to get to and from the outing.

        Aspleycare have also made it their mission to assist mothers. The volunteers offer expectant mothers immediate and practical help and provide support and love for women and their new babies. Aspleycare are an integral part of our community. I want to thank President Tom Borger, as well as Mr Clive Smith and Mrs Kay Smith, who are just two of the many volunteers at Aspleycare. I would also like to thank the
