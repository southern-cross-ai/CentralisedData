        I came to this place as a kid in my 20s, on the cusp of the new century. Within my first 12 months in this building, something terribly sad happened. The member for Isaacs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Wilton" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Wilton
        </a>
        , took his own life while in office. He was 44. I was a young assistant adviser back then, on the blue carpet. I listened to the condolence motion speeches throughout the day. Question time was cancelled, and the speeches rolled through the afternoon and into the evening. In those speeches, I saw something of the character of the men and women I so greatly admired in this place at that time—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         John Anderson
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        , among others. That day, they spoke of their affection for Wilton, a Labor man through to his bootstraps, who had served both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASU" rel="nofollow">
         ASU
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUW" rel="nofollow">
         NUW
        </a>
        . He was a member of the class of 1996. Wilton was pretty friendly with some on our side.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Billson" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Billson
        </a>
        , then the member for Dunkley, referred to him in his condolence speech as 'an electoral neighbour, a colleague and friend'. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We had a common boundary between our electorates, which occasionally meant there was friendly and spirited banter between us … but what I remember most about Greg was that we worked alongside and with one another when it was in the interests of our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The speeches that day were not just a reflection on Wilton or the odd bite of bipartisanship required to get stuff done here; they were also a reflection on this place and how, at its core, sat a compassion, empathy, goodwill and gratitude towards the 1,800-odd people who have been elected to it. Tony Abbott's words on that condolence motion were particularly strong when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … Greg Wilton came with high hopes to what he regarded as the greatest institution in the nation for helping people … and yet … he died of a broken heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He hated the character assassination which sadly is so much a part of the public discourse and the private conversation here and for which all of us bear a heavy responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We often complain about the low public standing of politicians, but other people take us at our own estimation, and we are always running each other down. Of course, there is a place for judgment, and sometimes there is a place for furious denunciation, but I think Australia would be better off without the feral quality which so often contaminates our public lives.
       </p>

        A few weeks ago, in the pages of the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper, I was referred to as 'a new breed of Liberal'. I can assure the good folk of Flinders I am very much an old breed of Liberal, formed in this place when many of its current inhabitants were still in short pants. It was here I learned the values and practices which sustained stable, mature, responsible and strong leadership in this country for over a decade, the most successful coalition government this country has ever known.
