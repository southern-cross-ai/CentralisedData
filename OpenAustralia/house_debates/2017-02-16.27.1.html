       <p>
        Geoscience Australia is proposing to refurbish its main building in Symonston in the Australian Capital Territory. The Geoscience Australia building was purpose built in 1997 to support its primary research activities for the Australian government, industry and stakeholders. In addition to office areas, the building contains a dedicated laboratory and physical storage infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012, Geoscience Australia examined its ongoing business requirements for long-term accommodation beyond 2020. This resulted in Geoscience Australia renewing its lease of the Symonston facility through to 2032. That is a long way away, but it is important that we move on these particular things now, appreciating the fact that it is 15 years into the distance. Renewing leases is important. Also, making sure that we get value for money for the Commonwealth and, through it, the taxpayers is essential. The proposed works will further consolidate Geoscience Australia's operational footprint, improving the built density and providing opportunities for sublease that would generate additional revenue for the Commonwealth.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">

        since last July. Just last week, I was able to visit many of the public servants in my portfolio area. They were appreciative of the fact that I visited them at the

       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works that I am discussing here with Geoscience Australia cover more than 19,000 square metres and include replacement of floor coverings and painting of internal wall surfaces. The work also includes changes to the overall fit-out to allow more flexible workspaces that will improve the delivery of core services for the government. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $17.50 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , and includes all costs such as builders' costs, furniture, fittings and equipment and workstations. It also includes provision for contingencies, cost escalation and associated design professional fees. A lease incentive towards fit-out, negotiated in 2013, will fund this initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the refurbishments are expected to begin in mid-2017 with completion expected by late-2018. I commend the motion to the House.

        , Melbourne, Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Administrative Appeals Tribunal proposes to undertake a fit-out of its leased premises at 15 William Street, Melbourne, Victoria, to accommodate the amalgamated Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the 2014-15 federal budget, the government announced that the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal would be amalgamated with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This amalgamation delivers savings through operational efficiencies by consolidating property holdings and streamlining 'back office' administrative processes. The Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015 gives legislative effect to that policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The move to a single location for the tribunal in Melbourne will allow for resources to be rationalised, particularly in the sharing of public facilities such as hearing and conference rooms across jurisdictions. The project will provide new working accommodation for tribunal staff and members, and hearing rooms and other facilities necessary for the conduct of administrative reviews. The design of the new fit-out will allow the amalgamated Administrative Appeals Tribunal to improve services to clients by using new technologies to deliver services more efficiently and effectively and by providing a single point of access for most Commonwealth merit reviews. The estimated total cost of the project is $15.68 million, excluding GST, which includes construction costs, management and design fees, furniture, fittings, workstations, staff costs, contingencies and escalation allowances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to begin in mid-2017 with practical completion scheduled for late 2017. I commend the motion to the House.
