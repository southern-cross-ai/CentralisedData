       <p>
        Last week the government committed funds to Holocaust education, and I commend them for that, but this week a member of the government recorded a podcast with a person who shared Neo-Nazi memes. Many dismiss the ongoing conspiracy theories of the member for Hughes about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        . The conspiracy theories and denial of climate change are obviously unscientific and the work of ignorance, but as is often the case with conspiracies, there is a sinister and dangerous underbelly that eventually shows its face. The member for Hughes's antivaccination and false medical advice has been deeply irresponsible during a global health pandemic. The member for Hughes is not a doctor, and nor is he in any way qualified to give advice on medicines or treatments. However, his false and deeply offensive comparisons of Victoria's health authorities with

        surely should have been the final straw for the Prime Minister to intervene, but there was nothingâ€”nothing from the Prime Minister, who is meant to lead and protect all of those in our country, especially minorities.

        Of course the member for Hughes sat down with Pete Evans to record his podcast. It clearly didn't bother the member for Hughes that Mr Evans has shared Neo-Nazi imagery, but it should bother the Prime Minister. It matters when members of the government endorse dangerous and offensive ideas, and it matters when our country's leaders fail to call them out. History has shown that, in these moments, indifference is the worst possible approach, but that is exactly what is happening. The Prime Minister is indifferent.
