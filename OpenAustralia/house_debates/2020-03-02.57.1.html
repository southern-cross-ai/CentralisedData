       <p>
        At the end of this month the Manningham community will say good bye to the chief executive officer of Doncare, Doreen
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoves" rel="nofollow">
         Stoves
        </a>
        . Doncare is the main welfare organisation in Menzies and has provided support to enhance the quality of life for people living in the municipality and surrounding communities. The majority of services are delivered by volunteers, including a team of around 300, who staff six op shops and also volunteer on the board of management. Last year, Doncare celebrated its 50th anniversary of serving the local Manningham community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my time as member for Menzies, Doreen has been a much loved and well-respected figure in the local community. Her commitment to the local community is second to none. Prior to working at Doncare, she worked at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        for 25 years before joining the local organisation. Doreen is also a clinical family therapist who previously worked with individuals and families. She has a particular interest in domestic and family violence and is a strong advocate for quality service provision to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community. Doreen has worked at developing strong links and partnerships with the service system in Manningham and at developing a range of programs to meet the needs of the local community. Doreen was appropriately awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in June 2013. She was also awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        in 1995 for her work with children and families while working for the Department of Human Services. Farewell, Doreen. The local community will greatly miss you.
