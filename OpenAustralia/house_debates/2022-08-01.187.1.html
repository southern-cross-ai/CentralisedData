        One of the greatest ever sportspeople died overnight: the incomparable basketball player

        . Bill Russell's talent, character and commitment to the game were remarkable and relentless, and the team success that followed was simply astounding. Under his leadership, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics" rel="nofollow">

        won eight championships in a row, from 1959 to 1966. Indeed, they won 11 times in 13 years, and Russell's record in deciding game 7s was 10-0. In the last two of those winning campaigns he played as captain and coach, the first

        to coach a major sport league franchise.

        Russell was not a flashy player. He was not a great scorer. He didn't care for statistics or celebrity. His extraordinary strengths were all the unfashionable building blocks of the game: playing defence, taking rebounds, making the right pass and making the players on his team better. He said:

       <p class="italic">
        I have very little faith in cheers, what they mean and how long they will last, compared with the faith I have in my own love for the game.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russell was consistently outspoken about racism and injustice in the United States, and in 2011

       <p>
        I fell in love with basketball when I was young, and at some point a family friend gave me a book chapter about Bill Russell. With no justification whatsoever, I chose to be No. 6 when I played. There has never been any part of my game or life that resemble Bill Russell's talent, courage and class. But I did want to play and live by his example. Vale Bill Russell.
