        Mr Speaker, a question to you: I would ask that you think about and report back to the House on what capacity I might have as the member for Grayndler in representing my constituents, who have been grossly misrepresented before the House by the Minister for

         The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. I will respond to his question right now. There are forms of the House which he can use. He is well aware of them. If he wishes to pursue those, then he should do so.

          Mr Speaker, a question to you: at the end of question time the Leader of the Opposition reflected on a member and, at the end of it, simply said, ‘I withdraw.’ Could you reflect on that and give us some advice tomorrow as to the appropriateness of that behaviour and whether that is something new? I am aware that, if someone makes a comment, they can be asked to withdraw it, but making a comment and withdrawing it at the same time is new to me in 10 years. I would appreciate some advice on the appropriateness of that as far as the House of Representatives is concerned.

           The minister would be well aware that, when a member has sought a comment to be withdrawn and the member who made that offensive remark has withdrawn it, that is the end of the matter.

            Mr Speaker, I ask for clarification. In this particular case the member for Brand came to the dispatch box, gave a number of descriptives, knowing that they were obviously unparliamentary, and then immediately withdrew without anyone on this side of the House having an opportunity to do anything about it. Is that acceptable behaviour?
