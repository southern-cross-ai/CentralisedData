        I take this opportunity to praise the good work of Warilla Public School in my electorate of Throsby. Students speak highly of the commitment and hard work of their teachers. They also speak highly of the funding that this Labor government has made available to assist in improving their school environment, resources and learning.

        on 14 August, year 6 students editorialised and offered their view on the funding that was directed to Warilla Public School to 'Build the Education Revolution'. They say that teachers used the opportunity during the construction phase of their new library and computer lab to teach and learn about mathematical concepts such as volume and area. They say that the new library and computer lab have become hubs of learning in their school—a tangible and lasting legacy of this government placing education at its core. They say that the government's Smarter Schools National Partnerships have supported teachers in improving their own skills and the students' literacy and numeracy. They say that they 'give a Gonski' and they are eagerly awaiting news of the Gonski review of funding of schools. They hope Gonski will mean more funding for their school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say that great schools like Warilla Public School deserve the additional funding that would be available through the Gonski recommendations. I would like to thank and congratulate all those who make Warilla Public School a great school—teachers, staff, students and parents.
