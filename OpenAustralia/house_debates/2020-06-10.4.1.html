        I rise to move a motion to suspend standing orders and advise the House that, pursuant to standing order 47(c)(ii), the Manager of Opposition Business and I have agreed that an absolute majority is not required. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring in relation to proceedings this week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) in the House today, the following order of business to apply:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately following the resolution of this motion, committee and delegation business and private Members' business, as determined by the Selection Committee, being given priority until 11.30 am;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) any divisions (except on a motion moved by a Minister) and quorums called for prior to 11.30 am being deferred until 11.30 am; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) proceedings from 11.30 am to follow the usual order of business for a Wednesday;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) in the Federation Chamber today, the following order of business to apply:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately following Members' constituency statements, committee and delegation business and private Members' business, as determined by the Selection Committee, being given priority until 1 pm; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) from 4 pm the standing orders applying to the necessary extent as if it were a Tuesday;

        (3) for Thursday, 11 June, the standing orders applying to the necessary extent as if it were a Wednesday;

         I want to thank the government, particularly the Leader of the House, for the way this has been negotiated in good faith and remind members that the normal pattern for the time we finish each day has changed this week. In particular, to members on my own side: don't leave at five o'clock on Thursday. If those on the opposite side choose to, that's a matter for them. As the Leader of the House said, on Thursday we will be sitting using the hours of business that would normally apply on a Wednesday, and then the earlier finish won't occur until the Friday. It's important that members note that, because it is a significant shift. There is no need for any amendments or anything like that from the opposition; it has all been negotiated in good faith, and I thank the Leader of the House for that.

         Question agreed to.
