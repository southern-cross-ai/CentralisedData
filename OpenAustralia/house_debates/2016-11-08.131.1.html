        I wish to inform the House that last Friday night Cabonne Council held its annual Cabonne Daroo Business Awards. The Daroo awards showcase the diversity and quality of businesses in the Cabonne Council local government area and have become a blueprint for regional business awards. This year marked the 17th year of the awards, with a record number of nominations. It was a glittering event, held at the Cumnock Showground, and in attendance were a number of special guests, including Cabonne Shire Mayor Ian Gosper, known as 'Gossie' to his many friends, and New South Wales Small Business Commissioner Robyn Hobbs
