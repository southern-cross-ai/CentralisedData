        As you well know, Australia is a tolerant society, but on the weekend we saw some of those views challenged. There were frightening scenes when a rally organised by the United Patriots Front—a misnomer, surely—appeared on the streets of Melbourne. Thankfully, they were confronted by a counterprotesters from the Campaign against Racism and Fascism. I hope the reported violent clashes between these two protest groups is not an emerging trend. Closer to home, in Moreton, last week a 22-year-old woman was convicted after using social media to target a community advocate with vile anti-Islamic abuse. I do know that gutless, vile and cowardly abuse on social media definitely is an emerging trend.
       </p>

        My electorate of Moreton is very multicultural. I represent a large number of different religious and ethnic groups—there are communities from Sudan, Bosnia, Vietnam, Taiwan, China and Korea, and many others, scattered throughout my electorate. Some of my own constituents have reported to me that these incidents of abuse have been increasing. It can be a challenge to live harmoniously in a multicultural society—living next door to somebody who is different—but obviously since white settlement began we have not always treated minority groups in Australia as well as we should. I am particularly reminded of that today on the 23rd anniversary of the Mabo decision. Back then the High Court's Justice Brennan in his landmark judgment said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A common law doctrine founded on unjust discrimination in the enjoyment of civil and political rights demands reconsideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mason's High Court spoke 204 years after 1788, so it is helpful to be reminded that we do not always get it right. But what is important is that when we are wrong, we must admit it and make changes, whether that be to the law or to our individual behaviour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Intolerance manifests from a natural fear of the unknown. It will always be present in Australia but politicians and community leaders must do all that we can to reach out and keep such intolerance in check. That is our responsibility. None of us are perfect but we can all do better and do more. It is only when we get to know our neighbours that we lose that fear of the unknown. Our own history shows that to be the case: if we ignore or, even worse, demonise minority groups—be they from a culture or a religion—then we are not only escalating the intolerance but we are not giving ourselves the chance to enrich the Australian story. In my electorate the Muslim community are very valued members of the larger population. They are playing a great role in countering radicalisation of young people. Their contribution to society should be applauded and encouraged.
