       <p>
        In late July, I had the pleasure of attending Old Mates Day at the Bream Creek Showgrounds in the southern part of my electorate. Old Mates Day is the brainchild of Sorrel farmer

        —no relation to the chemist chain, unfortunately for Terry—and it came about because, in 2014, the Bridgewater saleyards closed after serving the farmers of southern Tasmania for almost 40 years. Saleyards are a vital place of rural commerce, but they also offer a place for regional people to catch up and have a chat. What people realised after the closure of the saleyards was that that wasn't happening any more. People were going back home, and they were having social isolation. They weren't staying in touch.

        Terry is not a psychologist. He is not a social worker. He's just a local bloke who figured he could make a difference. Last year, he organised the first Old Mates Day in a shed on his property. And there was a magnificent turnout. People have been asking all year when the next one is. Well, that was a few weeks ago. And it was fantastic. So many people turned out to help—the Lions and rotary clubs of the region, the Bream Creek Show Committee, local butchers, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association,

        </a>
        , Tasmanian Fire Service, Roberts, Rural Alive and Well and so many individuals who I won't name for fear of leaving somebody out. This was Terry White's brainchild. It would not have happened without him. He reckons he's done now, and he reckons he's not going to do it next year. Time will tell. I think people like him don't know when to give up.
