       <p>
        Our government is committed to lowering taxes. Forty thousand taxpayers across the north-west, the west coast and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        in the great state of Tasmania are getting tax relief as a result of the Morrison government's policies. We've cut taxes for small businesses to the lowest level in 50 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        One particular business that's benefitting is De Bruyn's Transport, which is a Tasmanian family owned transport business based Burnie. They've got trucksâ€”lots of them. They've used the federal government's extension of the instant asset write-off to move their vehicle and equipment procurement program forward a complete year. This has enabled them to purchase a new fleet of heavy vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new fleet has meant a reduction in maintenance costs, greater fuel efficiencies, a reduction in emissions, better ergonomics and support for their ageing fleet of drivers. It's also helped attract new drivers to the industry and strengthen their bottom line. Their tax savings have also been invested into a new depot in Devonport, creating even more jobs and wealth for the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        De Bruyn's is one of the largest transport operators in Tasmania, and they're moving forward with confidence. On this side of the House, we understand that, in business, confidence is king. The Morrison government will always have the backs of our small and medium-sized businesses in the great state of Tasmania.
