        The 2015 budget is good for Tasmania, and it is good for Braddon. It is fair, it is responsible, it is measured and it is a budget that will build on the work the government has already done to repair and grow the north west economy. It is the next step in the Liberal government's long-term economic plan to build a stronger, safer and more prosperous future for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        We on the north west coast all know that there are economic challenges; yet, because of the economic management of this government, Tasmania's economic and employment position is improving. Our economic plan is working. Economic growth is up. Jobs are up: nearly 250,000 new jobs across the country and nearly 8,000 new jobs in Tasmania since September 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the small business package that will benefit thousands of small businesses in Tasmania and in Braddon particularly, the family package that will deliver fairer and more equitable child care for families in Braddon, and the youth unemployment program that will tackle our youth unemployment problem, the north west region is a big winner from the 2015 budget. Importantly for our region, the federal government has allocated $10 million for the Devonport LIVING

        project. This is an exciting project not only for Devonport but for the region. It will open up hundreds of millions of dollars in government and private investment and will create hundreds of jobs over the next four to five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget also confirmed $203 million over the next four years for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme enhancement, allowing our exporters to access dependent markets overseas, based on the new free trade agreements. The budget also confirmed $60 million over four years for tranche 2 of the Tasmanian Irrigation Scheme. These are economic enablers that will boost jobs, boost investment and give local Tasmanian businesses the opportunity to compete on the world stage and grow more of the world's best produce year on year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that many in the electorate are concerned about health, and I do commend the state government and the Minister for Health for examining the state's health services and committing to ensuring the health system delivers the best patient outcomes. But I want to make one thing clear: the federal budget delivers a 19 per cent increase in hospital funding for Tasmania over four years. That is on top of the 12 per cent increase last year. When it comes to the Mersey hospital, base funding is confirmed in the forward estimatesâ€”page 90, for those that are a little pedantic about the matter. The state and federal health ministers are finalising an agreement, and that will be announced soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is far more that we could talk about, but let me say that I believe this is a fair, responsible and measured budget that will build on the work the government has already done to repair economy of the north west, west coast and
