       <p class="italic">
        (1) the resumption of debate on the second readings of the bills being called on together;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) at the conclusion of the second reading debate, including a Minister speaking in reply, any questions being put on any amendments moved to motions for the second readings, and then one question being put on the second readings of the bills together;

       <p class="italic">
        (5) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just to briefly explain, both of those motions simply allow the debate on the appropriations to be held as a cognate debate and then the debate on the temporary budget repair levy bill, which obviously affects 14 separate pieces of legislation, also to be dealt with as a cognate debate. And I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his cooperation.
