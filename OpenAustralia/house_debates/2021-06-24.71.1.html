       <p>
        Today I'd like to recognise another very hardworking local volunteer in my electorate of Longman:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Scott" rel="nofollow">
         Darryl Scott
        </a>
        , the President of Narangba Dynamos Netball Club. Recently I awarded Darryl a 2021 volunteer award in recognition of his contribution to Narangba Dynamos netball. This netball club accepts players aged from five to 12. The teams and their coaches train at Narangba and play in the Caboolture Netball Association comp. For the past three years, Darryl has been President of the Narangba Dynamos Netball Club. He previously volunteered at the club as the NetSetGO coordinator.
       </p>
       <p>
        Darryl coaches for the club as well as coaching a representative team for the Caboolture Netball Association. In 2020 Darryl was appointed Chairman of Caboolture Netball Association. Darryl gives up all of his spare time, together with his family, who also volunteer at the club and for Caboolture Netball Association. Darryl works very hard to assist the Narangba Dynamos Netball Club in providing an opportunity for young people to play a sport that they love and in supporting and developing them not just as players but as people. You can find Darryl coaching, mentoring other coaches and committee members, making decisions collaboratively with the committee, setting up tents, managing parents' expectations and issues, cooking the barbecue at Bunnings to raise funds, cheering from the sideline for all club teams, cleaning out the club shed, and designing uniforms—I'm knackered just talking about it!—all while working full time. Darryl is an absolute champion. Well done, Darryl!
