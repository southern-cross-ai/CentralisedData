        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for the Human Services portfolio at Greenway,

         Department of Human Services

        proposes to undertake a fit-out of a new leased office building being constructed in Greenway.

        . The new building was originally intended to accommodate the National Support Office staff and facilities of Centrelink. In accordance with the government's Service Delivery Reform Program, which the then minister for human services announced on 16 December 2009, Centrelink,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medicare Australia
        </a>
        and other portfolio agencies were integrated into the Department of Human Services with effect from 1 July 2011. The new building is therefore now intended to accommodate staff from across the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        The building will enable about 90 per cent of the department's national office staff to co-locate in the Tuggeranong town centre precinct. This will enable the department to relinquish a number of smaller, and in some cases, substandard leases around the ACT. The building will be purpose designed and built and will be fitted out with about 1,747 work points. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $38.55 million plus

         GST
        </a>
        . Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fitout works are scheduled to start with designing in August 2011 and to be completed, including certification, by June 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. The developer commenced base building construction in mid May 2011. The building is expected to be ready for occupancy by the end of June 2013. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake an integrated fitout of new leased premises at 55 Elizabeth Street, Brisbane, Queensland. The new premises will replace two existing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        locations in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane CBD
        </a>
        . The lease for the existing properties would expire in June 2013 and February 2014. It is expected that the relocation into a new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies, and long-term viability through improvements in site infrastructure. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $33.1 million plus GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fitout works are scheduled to start in May 2012 and be completed by 1 May 2013. The developer commenced base building works on site in May 2011 with demolition and excavation for the basement areas being the first tasks. The ATO is expected to take up occupancy of the building in May 2013. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.
