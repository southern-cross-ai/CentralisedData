       <p>
        As chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and on behalf of the Human Rights Subcommittee, I present the committee's report entitled
        <i>
         The pursuit of equality: inquiry into the rights of women and children
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”The inquiry was referred to the committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong" rel="nofollow">
         Penny Wong
        </a>
        , in September 2022. The terms of reference were broad in scope, which allowed the committee to gather evidence on a wide range of issues facing women and children around the world today. The committee received 49 submissions and held nine public hearings. Evidence was received from a range of stakeholders, including government agencies, aid organisations and representatives of women and children's rights groups both domestically and internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost every witness and submitter in the inquiry told the committee members the same thing: the rights of women and children around the world are in decline. This is manifesting in a range of indicators, including rates of violence, exploitation and abuse of women and children. A combination of the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and conflict and instability have led to this regression of human rights. Further elements, such as growing inequality and resistance from nation-states hostile to the international rights agenda, have further added to this situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        While efforts have been made over decades to improve the rights of women and children, the international community continues to grapple with these issues. Without strong and urgent action, this will condemn multitudes of women and children to lives affected by abuse, neglect and violence. It is imperative that Australia takes the lead to reverse the tide.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard that the Australian government is doing a great deal of work in this space, including the recent release of Australia's International Development Policy and changes to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Development_Assistance" rel="nofollow">
         Official Development Assistance
        </a>
        program. However, further work can be done to improve outcomes for the world's most vulnerable groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report makes 10 recommendations which the committee hopes will address both the broader picture of the role of women and children in Australia's foreign policy, and specific issues that impact the rights of women and children. The key recommendations of the report include:
       </p>

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The committee heard sensitive and harrowing evidence from victims of gender-specific violence, many of whom continue to live with the impacts of their abuse. On behalf of the committee, I extend my thanks to the victims who retold their stories so bravely to us, and to all the stakeholders and submitters who contributed to this inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank the subcommittee chair, the member for Calwell, Ms Maria Vamvakinou, who did a great job in leading this critical inquiry. I also thank the deputy chair, the Hon. Senator Linda Reynolds, for her collegiality, cooperation and engagement during the inquiry. I thank also Ophelia Tynan and Kimberlee Armstrong, who helped draft the report, for the great work they did. I thank both of them, and they're here in the chamber. I also thank the committee secretariat generally, who performed with efficiency and effectiveness in what was a difficult, disturbing, confronting and controversial inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        But particularly I want to give my thanks to the person in charge of this committee, Susan Cardell. Susan is about to leave the parliament, after working for decades in this place. Her service to our country cannot be underestimated. She has been efficient and effective in all that she has done. I have travelled with Susan overseas to various parts of the world. She always conducts herself in a most professional and expert way. The way she has led this inquiry and corralled all of us and the leadership she has shown are exemplary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Susan, I know that you propose to continue your contribution to your local community in the same way you have contributed to our country. You intend to do voluntary work. I know that your son is currently now working in this place, having followed your lead. That contribution by your family is simply fantastic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Susan. People on both sides of the chamber would know her, and I think it behoves all of us to express our deep and abiding admiration, respect and affection for Susan. Thank you for the many reports and many inquiries that you have led and been involved with.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, Susan, I wish you well in your retirement. I know it will not be retirement; I know you will keep on contributing. Thank you very much, Susan.

         Given that there are no other members seeking leave to speak, does the member for Blair wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?
