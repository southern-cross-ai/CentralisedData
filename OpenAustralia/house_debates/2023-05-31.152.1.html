        I rise to speak in memory of Mrs Lyn Rigby, who died at the age of 78 earlier this month. Lyn was a giant of her community but small in stature. She wore her heart on her sleeve and worked with a constant smile on her face.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lyn was a prolific volunteer. She ran the kiosk at the Evandale Football Club for 40 years. She was also the president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        kiosk auxiliary, where she also volunteered for many years. Lyn's support for her community knew no bounds. Along with all the other things she packed into her busy schedule, she was a support volunteer for palliative care and the vice-president of the organisation. Lyn was volunteering until the day she died. She often drove cancer patients much older than her to and from appointments to ensure they received the care and support they needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lyn was one-of-a-kind. I am proud that I knew her. There will never be another like her. Her family and community are heartbroken that she is no longer with us, but they take solace in the knowledge that she is now reunited with her loving husband, Jim, who passed away in 2000. Lyn is survived by her loving sons, Grant, Graham, Michael and Scott; their partners; and her 10 grandchildren. I offer my heartfelt condolences to Lyn's family and the Evandale Football Club community, of which I'm a proud patron. Lyn, may you rest in peace.

        Last week Australians brought out their cakes and sandwiches to commemorate the Cancer Council's Biggest Morning Tea. Across my electorate of Lyons Tasmanians got together for a cuppa to raise much-needed funds in the fight across my electorate. While I was in parliament for the day, my staff enjoyed a trip out to Deloraine to join Harcourts Meander Valley and their directors, Donna, Darryl and Kate, who put on a fantastic morning tea.

        of Kempton is also running two morning teas, one on 21 June in Kempton and another on 26 June in Oatlands, in conjunction with community radio station 7MID, the voice of the Midlands. John is raising funds in memory of his late wife, Sandra, who died from breast cancer in 2020. I'm sad I won't be able to join John for his morning teas, due to parliamentary commitments, but I will certainly be assisting him to reach his fundraising goal of $1,000. I wish him all the very bestâ€”indeed, I wish all volunteers for the Cancer Council, who do such incredible work across the community, all the very best.
