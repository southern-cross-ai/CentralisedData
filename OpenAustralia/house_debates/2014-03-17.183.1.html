       <p>
        Today I rise to let the chamber know about a young man in my electorate, Mitch Bourke, who yesterday walked nearly 20 kilometres through Bendigo to raise money for an autism resource centre. After funding fell through for this very important project, Mitch decided that he would walk from one side of Bendigo to the other to raise money. He set a goal of $25,000, and I am very proud to announce that he exceeded that goal through sponsorships and donations from our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I first met Mitch, he said that the centre was important so that other kids and families did not go through what he and his family went through a few years ago. Before Mitch was diagnosed, he said that life at school and home was tough. He said he was violent and was very unhappy. He felt frustrated and sometimes thought of suicide. Today, Mitch is very different and he believes that the centre will help other families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday's walk was a successâ€”so successful that the idea is now being picked up nationally. From next year, other cities and other regional centres will engage in the campaign. Yesterday, when Mitch crossed the finish line, many people talked about having tears in their eyes, including his mother, Mychelle. She said that Mitch has got the word out: 'To see autism in a positive light is amazing and will help so many families.' I am proud to have sponsored Mitch and I look forward to joining the team next year, when we do the walk again in Bendigo.
