        I would also like to add my condolences on the tragic and sad passing of Steve Irwin. My condolences go to his wife, Terri, and children, Bindi and Bob.

        is only a short distance away from my electorate office. I remember the absolute delight recently of my nephews and nieces when they visited it. Steve Irwin brought vitality, colour and the great educational attributes of the animal kingdom to both adults and children alike around the world. He will be sadly and sorely missed. He is one of our great sons in Queensland and a great Australian icon. I would like to express my deepest condolences to all at Australia Zoo—it is a very sad time for them—and to all his family.

        Today I also wish to speak about two very important developments in education in the Petrie electorate. I had the honour and the pleasure of opening the first stage of the refurbishments for the technical college on 3 August. Many thanks must go to chairman Les Bradshaw and his very capable and talented team of local businesses and education authorities. Recently, they were also awarded another $3.1 million for the extensions and capital works for the hospitality section.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a fantastic opportunity for the north of Brisbane. We have had skill shortages in a number of areas, particularly skilled tradespeople. If anyone has been trying to get home improvements done lately, they will have seen the amazing skill shortages particularly in that industry. There has also been a longstanding skills shortage in the hospitality industry. For as long as I can remember, going back 25 years, there have never been enough chefs and qualified cooks in the hospitality industry, and the industry can never have enough of those people. With tourism growing the way it is in Australia at the moment, the demand for them will only increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        The college has set itself a very ambitious projected target of 150 students, and enrolment is rapidly projected to grow to 350 by 2009. Some of the things that will be taught at the technical college will be building and construction, metal and engineering, automotive, electrotechnology, commercial cookery and hospitality. They will be able to get an Australian school based apprenticeship at certificate 3 level so that they will be well advanced towards completing their apprenticeship by the time they leave the college.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian technical college will operate from two campuses. I want to congratulate all at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        for the wonderful and supportive work they have provided. It will also have a satellite campus at

        , and it is believed that the hospitality section will be largely based in Fortitude Valley. This is a very strong initiative. It came about as a collaborative work with Commerce Queensland and the
