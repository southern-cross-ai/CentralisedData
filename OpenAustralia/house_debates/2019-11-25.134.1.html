        I'd like to recognise two groups of people from the Centenary suburbs in the Oxley electorate, the first being a team of 17 students from Riverlife Church in Jindalee, who set off a few short days ago to perform community and health assistance work with not-for-profit groups in Thailand. Their work will include visits to prisons, juvenile detention centres, community development programs and children's homes. This annual trip is an important part of the church's overseas outreach. The communities they work with on the ground always say how vital this support is from this Australia church. I especially acknowledge Pastor John Robertson and his amazing team at the church for their ongoing commitment and dedication to making the world a better place, not only across the globe but also right here in our local community. I have been fortunate to attend a number of services at the church in the past and I know just how much love Pastor John and the congregation have for our community. I send my best wishes to the students and their parents for safe travels, a fulfilling trip, and a safe return home.

        Just down the road from Riverlife Church is the amazing Jindalee Scout Group, where I recently had the honour of presenting the prestigious
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Scout_Medallion" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Scout Medallion
        </a>
        to Brady Schuh, Ari Christodolou and Cole O'Brien. The Australian Scout Medallion demonstrates a scout's commitment to developing their independence and leadership skills. It is the pinnacle award for the scout section. Scouts receiving the award have shown great personal development and commitment to the three scouting principles: duty to one's faith, duty to self and duty to others. The award, which was introduced in 2003, provides an additional challenge for top scouts. It brings together a number of key skills and elements learned through scouting. Participation in a scout leadership course and completion of the Adventurer Cord are required to earn the medallion. Scouts also need to demonstrate an active leadership role by taking part in the Australian Scout Medallion Leadership Activity. The leadership activity is chosen by the scout and showcases their ability to take initiative by following a 'plan, do, review' structure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I send my sincere congratulations to Brady, Ari and Cole for their achievement, alongside their parents and the Jindalee scouts, and everyone else who has helped achieve this significant recognition: the Australian Scout Medallion. Brady, Ari, and Cole, good luck for the road ahead, and I know you will continue to achieve great things for our local community. I really look forward to visiting the Jindalee scouts for their Christmas break-up this Friday evening.
