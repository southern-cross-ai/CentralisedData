        (2) acknowledges that:

        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the increasing costs in the construction industry are creating significant strains on Australian building companies;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) rising costs are creating serious delays and further exacerbating substantial housing shortages in many communities across the country; and

       <p class="italic">
        (c) these shortages are perpetuating the current rental crisis;

        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) union lawlessness is on the rise in the commercial construction sector following the Government's announcement to abolish the construction industry watchdog, the Australian Building and Construction Commission (

         ABCC

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) implement measures to reign in rising costs, assisting businesses, renters and Australians who are building or have bought their own home;
