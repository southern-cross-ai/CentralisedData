        My question is to the Prime Minister. A private member's bill on marriage equality introduced by the member for Leichhardt is currently before the House. It would take half an hour of parliamentary time to allow this bill to be voted on. It could be done tomorrow. Will the Prime Minister allow a vote on this bill and allow members of his party a free vote as he has publicly called for previously?

         I thank the honourable member for her question and I respect her very deep interest in this issue. Marriage equality, or same-sex marriage, is a very significant issue on which people of good faith, the best faith, honestly have different opinions both on the honourable member's side of the House and on our side of the House. Historically, issues of this type have been resolved in parliament by free votes. The honourable member is correct in referring to that. Another way of dealing with this is by a vote of the people. Our government has decided that the resolution of this matter will be determined by a vote of all the people via a plebiscite to be held after the next election.

           either through their representatives or directly, can make an honest, conscientious decision. Our government, our party room, has decided that the decision will be taken by a plebiscite. Why is the opposition afraid of the people having a vote? Why don't they want all Australians having a vote? There is no greater virtue in a free vote here or a plebiscite. They are each means of resolving the matter. One of them, I grant you, is more expensive. Nonetheless, it is a very legitimate and democratic way of dealing with it. That is what we have resolved.

             At the next election, Australians will have a choice. The Labor Party will say, 'Vote for us and marriage equality will be dealt with by the politicians, by the parliament, in a free vote after the election.' And we will say, 'If we're re-elected to government, every single Australian will have a say.' We all respect members of parliament—after all, we are all members of parliament—but we are just representatives and we are just 150 in number. Every single Australian will have a vote on the issue after the next election if we are returned to government. How can the opposition seriously and credibly say that that is anything other than thoroughly democratic? When did it cease to be democratic to let the people speak?
