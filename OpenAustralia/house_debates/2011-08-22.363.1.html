        The Prime Minister promised to wear out her shoe leather explaining the carbon tax that she said she would never introduce. But it is a big country, and I understand that it is pretty hard to get around it all, and as I am a generous man I thought I would save her some time. I invited the people of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Latrobe Valley
        </a>
        to send the Prime Minister a message. I invited Latrobe Valley residents to tell

         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        what they thought about the carbon tax.

         now might be interested to hear what the Australian people are saying—what the hardworking mums and dads of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Latrobe Valley
         </a>
         are saying—as they are in here talking about the big polluters. Let us hear what the mums and dads of the Latrobe Valley are saying about their carbon tax. From Ken in Traralgon: 'You pinched the last election with your lie. Prove how popular you are: call an election.' Then we have Brian from Willung: 'An absolute disaster for Latrobe Valley for families and workers alike.' And, finally, here is Natasha from Traralgon: 'It means that my husband may lose his job at the Hazelwood Power Station. We cannot provide to our children the simple things in life like a good education due to rising living expenses. Not good enough, Julia.'

         It is interesting that the others opposite are starting to interject. Why does one of you not have the spine to stand up for workers anymore? Why won't one of you stand up and have the spine for the workers? People in my community do not want your household assistance package and they do not want your jobs transition plan; they want the decency of keeping their jobs. You would have to be an absolute mug to support the introduction of a new tax which will make Australian companies less competitive during a time of great global economic uncertainty.
