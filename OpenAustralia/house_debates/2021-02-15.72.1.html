       <p>
        Rorts, rorts and more rortsâ€”that's the standard Australians now expect from the Morrison government, because this is a government whose members are only in it for themselves. Just the latest in the long line of Liberal Party rorts is the scheme run by the member for Dickson, who treated money set aside to make Australian communities safe as yet another secret Liberal Party slush fund. Does anything better sum up this government than the minister responsible for community safety rorting money from a community safety fund? Because this Prime Minister has made it clear that he's just fine with corruption and rorts, the member for Dickson could confidently act with impunity in his abuse of taxpayer funds. This rort was so shameless. With the Liberal candidate for Braddon, he announced two grants in a by-election, before the guidelines for the fund had been established and before the application process had even opened. That's some rort! The ever-growing list of scandals surrounding the Morrison government shows why Australia needs a powerful, independent and transparent national anticorruption commission and why this Prime Minister and his Attorney-General will do everything in their power to prevent one from being established.
