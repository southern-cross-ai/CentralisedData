        Today I rise to acknowledge the achievements of Romilly Madew, a resident of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Whale Beach
        </a>
        , and her role in the growth of green building in Australia. Romilly attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pymble_Ladies'_College" rel="nofollow">
         Pymble Ladies' College
        </a>
        before completing a Bachelor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_Economics" rel="nofollow">
         Agricultural Economics
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Sydney
        </a>
        , which is the same degree I have. Following her studies, Romilly embarked on what would prove to be a highly successful business career, serving as National Order Processing Manager for Link Telecommunications. I should add at this point—we did ask Romilly to give us some details, and she told us that she worked at Link Telecommunications from 1900 to 1994, making her currently 118 years old—I think she meant 1990 to 1994—and also as National Client Relationship Manager for King &amp; Wood Mallesons from 1994 to 2002. During this time, she also acted as joint owner of the Madew grapefoodwine restaurant. In 2002, Romilly commenced work as executive director for the Property Council of Australia and was also executive director responsible for sustainability. This role allowed Romilly to become heavily involved in the green and sustainable building and construction industry, spaces which were beginning to grow rapidly in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was in 2005 that Romilly made a move that continues to define her career today, joining the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Building_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Green Building Council
        </a>
        of Australia as a consultant while simultaneously authoring the publication
        <i>
         The dollars and sense of green buildings.
        </i>
        In 2006, she commenced leading the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Building_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Green Building Council of Australia
        </a>
        , a role which she continues in today. During her tenure, the council has grown significantly in terms of size, reputation and influence, and is today the second largest green building council within the 75-strong World Green Building Council network. Romilly has been an extremely effective leader in bringing together key stakeholders across the industry in order to drive the sustainable building movement and to impact Australian society in a positive manner. In 2017, Romilly was awarded the World Green Building Council Chairman's Award. This is in addition to numerous other awards such as being named Pittwater Citizen of the Year in 2016 by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittwater_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , receiving an International Leadership Award in 2015 from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Green Building Council, and being named as one of the 100 Women of Influence by the

        and Westpac in 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from business, Romilly has been an active member of the local community, serving as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy President
        </a>
        of the Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council, Independent Chair of the Currawong State Park Advisory Board in Pittwater, while also being a member of the Nestle Creating Shared Value round table. She is currently the club president, a surfboat rower and nipper age manager at the Bilgola Beach Surf Lifesaving Club.
