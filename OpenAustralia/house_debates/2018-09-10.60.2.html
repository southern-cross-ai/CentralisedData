          I wish to advise the House that on Friday, 24 August 2018, the federal parliamentary Liberal Party elected me, the member for Cook, as the leader of the Liberal Party, and the honourable member for Kooyong as the deputy leader. As a result of this I was sworn in as Prime Minister that same day, and the member for Kooyong was sworn in as the Treasurer. For the information of the House, I present the changed ministerial arrangements.

          I'd like to place on record the thanks of this chamber, but in particular the parliamentary Liberal and National parties, for the dedicated service of former Prime Minister Turnbull. I have had the opportunity to extend my remarks and sincere best wishes to him on other occasions, and I don't intend to prolong that matter here today in the House. I also wish to thank the member for Curtin for her 11 years of service as deputy leader, and commend her for her great service to her country.

           The National Party had a meeting this morning. At that meeting the member for Murray was elected chief whip of the National Party and the member for Flynn was elected as his deputy. Both were elected unopposed. I thank the previous incumbents, the member for Capricornia and the member for

            On indulgence, in reply to the Prime Minister's comments, I congratulate the Prime Minister on his elevation to this high office. This is a great country and a remarkable country, and it's a special privilege to be elected Prime Minister. I also wish to record our acknowledgement of the service of the previous Prime Minister,

I also acknowledge the outgoing Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the former foreign minister, Ms Julie Bishop. We acknowledge your service and thank you for it.
