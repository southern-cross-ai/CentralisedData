        I rise today to pay my respects to a much-loved local resident and long-time volunteer, Philip Fehon. Philip moved to Penrith with his wife in 1952 and, as a result, the Fehon family have become an integral part of our Penrith community. Prior to opening his own practice in 1964, he worked for a range of local businesses, including Neils, and Ron Mulock's practice. Phil served on the executive of the

        and was President of the Penrith chamber of commerce. In 1979, he was awarded a Paul Harris Fellow by South Penrith Rotary. Later, his work in the community and the church was recognised with a

        and a Papal Knighthood.

        Speaking about his father, Bernard remarked: 'Dad was always busy helping others, but he always had time as a father to include us in projects, like building a shed. Those were great projects, and those were family times.' Bernard Fehon, of course, has gone on to be the man who started the

        Sleepout. Phil is survived by a massive seven children, 21 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        I often say that Penrith is like a big country town. We are a regional city, but we have a very strong community and a network, and, when someone like Phil passes away, he is definitely felt. I thank Phil for his contribution to the community. I would like to thank the Fehon family for continually supporting our community. Vale, Philip Fehon.
