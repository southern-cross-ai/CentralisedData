        in the electorate of Braddon are international champions. The school's Lego robotics team, the Techno Warriors, have just returned from the first Lego League Razorback Open Invitational in the United States. There they competed against the best of the best from across the world over seven different challenges. Leighland's team of robotics superstars won two sections and was placed fourth in another. To put icing on the cake, their robotics teacher and coach, Jacob McNab, was introduced to the member mentor hall of fame.

The team has developed a concept robotics solar panel hydroelectricity-generating turtle that can be launched in local areas during emergency events in order to provide power.
