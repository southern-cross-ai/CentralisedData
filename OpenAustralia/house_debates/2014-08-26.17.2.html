       <p>
        The 2014 budget is a toxic brew of arrogance and ambush, incompetence and inequality, division and disunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are told that cabinet met yesterday to talk about how to better spin the budget. What those opposite do not understand is that it is not about the spin and it is not about the sales job; it is about the substance of this unfair budget.

        It is little wonder that people are lining up to reject the budget when its chief architect has shown in the last few weeks that he does not have a clue. This is the guy who said that 'it is strongly arguable that pensioners are going to be better off', not understanding that his own budget papers have $449 million coming out of the pockets of pensioners over the next four years. It is the same guy who said, 'We are the best friends pensioners ever had', not knowing that the Parliamentary Budget Office said that $23 billion is coming out of the age pension over the next 10 years. It is the same guy who said that his electorate of
