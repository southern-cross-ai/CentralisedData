       <p>
        I'm sure every member of parliament will be only too keen to attest to the value of a great staff member. It's not the service they provide to us but, rather, the service they provide to our communities that fills us with gratitude and respect. In this vein, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank former staff member and very good friend Mr Michael Duff for having set up my office in the midst of a pandemic and who's now returned to his work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toowoomba_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Toowoomba Regional Council
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael is very well known in our community. His service to our community deserves recognition, be it for setting up kids' sports clubs, Tough Guy book clubs, or, most importantly, for being chief cattle steward at the Proston Show. Communities are built upon the actions of people who put service to others above themselves. I'm very grateful to have had Michael's spirit of service in my office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael always forced me to ask two questions of myself before taking any decision as the member for Groom: firstly, '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_I" rel="nofollow">
         Do I
        </a>
        believe it?' and, secondly, 'Is it good for the people of Groom?' It's a very good basis for any decision to be made. I've endeavoured ever since to keep this framework about me. I think it speaks to Michael's character that it was on these solid foundations that he sought to make Groom a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I give my personal thanks to Michael. I remember during the world camp quarantine fiasco I often found myself feeling a little bit like Horatio on the bridge, wondering who would come out and stand beside me as I fought against this folly. I'm forever grateful and proud that you, Michael, were always there, right by my side. I thank you for your service and I thank you for your friendship.
