       <p>
        I have previously spoken in this place about Holroyd councilâ€™s proposal to close Wentworthville swimming pool, which will have a devastating impact on residents in my electorate. On Sunday the state member for Toongabbie,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rees" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and I met with Mr Peter Bain and other members of Wentworthville Swimming Club at Wentworthville pool. I commend their determination to keep up the fight on this issue. I commit to continuing to lead from the front on it as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of the club swim every Sunday morning, from October to March. If Holroyd council closes the pool, the club will no longer be able to take part in this healthy and social activity. Not only are the members of the club concerned about the impacts the closure of the pool will have on themselves but they are very concerned about the impact it will have on our wider community. The pool is a very popular destination for local families during hot summer months. Last Sunday was a scorcher in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , with temperatures in the mid-thirties. The pool was packed. If the pool closes, they will no longer have access to their local swimming pool.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many local schools use the pool for their swimming carnivals, just as I did as a student at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady
        </a>
        of Mercy, at Parramatta. If the pool is closed, local schools will have difficulty finding a suitable venue for their carnivals. Indeed, I have been informed that it is booked out for schools for many months. Over the past fortnight I have held many street meetings and met locals on their way to work at Toongabbie and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendle_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        train stations. I have collected hundreds of signatures on my petition to keep our pool open. The message to Holroyd council and to every elected councillor on that council is clear: keep Wentworthville Pool open.
