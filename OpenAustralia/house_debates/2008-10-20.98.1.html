        Earlier this month a number of us marked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of Older Persons with the presentation of recognition awards to just some of the extremely worthy older persons who have helped shape the community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The first Meals on Wheels kitchen in Port Adelaide was opened in 1954 and is now named after the organisation’s founder, the extraordinary
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Doris Taylor
        </a>
        . Despite being paralysed and almost completely dependent for her physical needs, Doris was a dedicated social campaigner who fought for the rights and dignity of the underprivileged and the vulnerable. A staunch Labor supporter, she also successfully managed the first election campaign of one of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        ’s most progressive premiers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Dunstan" rel="nofollow">
         Don Dunstan
        </a>
        . Following the lead of Doris Taylor were six recipients of this year’s recognition awards: Jill Curtin and Margaret Robertson, who have both provided 30 years of service to Osborne Meals on Wheels; from the Woodville kitchen, Annie Raets, with 31 years of service, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret Evans
        </a>
        , with 32, including many years as welfare officer; and, from the original kitchen in Port Adelaide, Lorraine Nicholls, with 35 years of service, and Judy Hunter, with 42 years of continuous service, including 14 as committee secretary.

        </a>
        , with its emphasis on social responsibility and community cohesion, also provided a number of worthy recipients for recognition: George Bonsor and Floss Holman, who have both been involved with the Pennington group for 18 years and have served in numerous committee positions; from the Royal Park/Hendon group, my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Bell" rel="nofollow">
         Pat Bell
        </a>
        for her many years of service as area coordinator and now secretary, and Alice Knibbs for her longstanding committee membership and co-editing of the newsletter; from Woodville, Clarrie Bell, who as sole editor and publisher has at last count produced 223 editions of the newsletter since its inception; and, finally,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marsh" rel="nofollow">
         Doug Marsh
        </a>
        , whose dedication is best illustrated by him single-handedly taking on the job of removing graffiti from the Woodville train station—no easy task, as this station sees many aspiring young artists, but he has been cleaning it on a weekly basis for 18 years and, at the age of 90, is still doing it today.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is perhaps not surprising that our services associations find a dedicated volunteer base from within their particular membership. This year’s recognition awards were given to Albert ‘Macca’ Mackinder, from the Semaphore and Port Adelaide
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , who volunteers seven days a week and will not even take a public holiday off; from the Port Adelaide Naval Association, Geoffrey Cotton, who serves them as a jack of all service, and Len Ruth, who keeps the lest-we forget tradition alive by educating local children about Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        ; and, nominated by the Merchant Navy Association executive,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         John Williams
        </a>
        and Keith Ridgeway, who, amongst a litany of volunteer activities, managed to organise the only parade in Australia to commemorate the first national Merchant Navy Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our churches have always been a driving force for social inclusion, and they inspire their members to be active in their community. Recognition awards went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Devine" rel="nofollow">
         John Devine
        </a>
        and Marge Lytwyn from the Seaton Christian Family Centre for their services to their church and the community; Nu Yen for her weekly efforts in her congregation’s kitchen; and, from the Le Fevre Christian Family Centre, Fred ‘Tiny’ Lennell for being an active member whilst also caring for his disabled wife and training young boxers. Tiny, in fact, trained one of my local parliamentary colleagues in his younger days, and according to Tiny this was one politician who was always going to be more persuasive with his voice than with his fists.
       </p>

        With its wide range of courses, activities, workshops and support groups, the Junction Community Centre provides a hub for the culturally diverse community of Ottoway. Cynthia Lodge received a recognition award for her 20 years of dedicated service to the management of this vibrant centre and for her generous community spirit.

        Established in 1885, Port Adelaide Cycling Club has been home to many, many champions, including the 2004 Olympic gold medallist Stuart O’Grady. What is also remarkable about this club is its vice-president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brooks" rel="nofollow">
         Gordon Brooks
        </a>
        , who received his recognition award for volunteering his services to the club for 71 years. During that time he served as secretary for 48 years and as president for 10. Gordon is a loyal man. He met his wife at a club event in 1938 and has been a racing cyclist for 68 years. Even aged 86, he still races with a handicap of 1.952.
       </p>
       <p>
        Collectively, these award recipients have provided more than half a millennium of volunteer service. Aside from their community spirit, what these older persons all have in common is humour, vitality and character. Their contribution not only benefits society but keeps them young.
