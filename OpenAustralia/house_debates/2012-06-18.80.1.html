        My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister update the House on Australia's commitment to protection of our oceans? Are there any risks to delivering the policy? What are the implications beyond Commonwealth waters?

         I am glad that there is a side of the House willing to ask a question on this issue. It was extraordinary that those opposite were willing to damage the national interest on this issue with their talk of a 'killer attack on the way'—and we have all been waiting with suspense. Well, a major announcement was made last week. Australia has always been one of the world leaders in national parks on land. Yellowstone and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Royal National Park
         </a>
         were the first two national parks on land in the world. Last week Australia also became the world leader on national parks in the ocean. That is something that this side of the House is very proud of and it is something on which—despite the games that are being played by those opposite—it was thought there was a level of bipartisanship. The principles and the plan were first put forward under the Keating government, but the commitments that were made internationally were made at a conference known as Rio+10 in Johannesburg, where the representative of Australia was a bloke by the name of Kemp—Environment Minister Kemp—when the other side signed up to the words that it would be a 'representative, comprehensive and adequate network' of marine national parks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since then the objections have come—with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Boswell" rel="nofollow">
          Ron Boswell
         </a>
         , interestingly, becoming the person to commit the opposition to try to tear this apart—on grounds relating to the impact on commercial fishers and rec fishers. Let us look at each of them. In terms of commercial fishing, the impact on the gross value of production is between one and two per cent of the total industry—a one to two per cent impact. On rec fishing, which has been the principal issue that the Leader of the Opposition has identified as being his concern, if you are on the east coast and you are anywhere south of Mackay, you have got to get out in your tinny almost to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Lord Howe Island
         </a>
         before you find the first area where rec fishers are not allowed to go. Even if you are in Mackay you have to take your tinny for 400 kilometres before you reach Marion Reef. Once you get to Marion Reef you are banned from fishing on it but you are still allowed to fish around it—containing the key pelagic species that the rec fishers are after. We have a situation where, in relation to the fear campaign that they have wanted to run during the last 12 months, the time is up. Rec fishers know that this is in Commonwealth waters, a long way away from the areas that they want, and Australians are proud to be the world leaders in establishing protection of the oceans.

          Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the minister's comments on the need for global action on our oceans and our environment. How will Australia be advancing this at the Rio+20 conference?

           I am very glad that question was asked. To ensure that all of these reforms are best practice you want to make sure that you go as far as possible in the world coming closer to the good standard of fisheries management that Australia has and the good standard of marine parks that Australia has. That is why it used to be bipartisan that we would have an involvement in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Triangle" rel="nofollow">
            Coral Triangle
           </a>
           initiative. That is why it used to be bipartisan that we would engage in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit" rel="nofollow">
            Earth Summit
           </a>
           and the meeting of environment ministers that happens once every 10 years. It is not necessarily the summit itself; it is the bilateral meetings that you have on the one occasion when all the environment ministers of the world are in the same place. It should be bipartisan that you will have those negotiations country after country. Yet the exact same officials who were organising bilateral after bilateral, back to back—not the meetings on the beach that the member for Flinders said that he wanted to be able to attend when he was on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
            TV
           </a>
           on the weekend but the bilaterals where you advance the national interest—and meeting after meeting are now cancelling those meetings. The same pairing arrangements that caused the Leader of the Opposition to play 'chasings' in and out of the chamber and caused chaos on that other side mean that even this has to be turned into a political game.

            Marine Park was originally capped at $10 million but subsequently blew out to close to $250 million. How has the minister arrived at a figure of $100 million as the cost of compensation to rezone an area 10 times that size?

             I thank the member for Leichhardt for opening up the cost blow-out that was administered by the other side. The bioregional planning that is taking place takes place under national environmental law—the legislation that was introduced by a bloke you might have heard of by the name of

             . Across our oceans there is one region that was done by the previous government—one region only—and that was the south-east. When the south-east was done that provided the template for displacement policy, and that is exactly the template that the government is providing and is following through on.
