       <p>
        Yesterday, after a long, 10-day wait, we finally saw a result in the Tasmanian upper house election for the seat of Windermere, where I live. I'd first like to acknowledge retiring member
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Dean" rel="nofollow">
         Ivan Dean
        </a>
        , who has dedicated much of his life to public service in our community, first as policeman and then as Launceston mayor, before being elected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Council
        </a>
        18 years ago. I know firsthand, as a former mayor, how dedicated Ivan was to our community and I'd like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude for his tireless commitment to the people of Windermere.
       </p>
       <p>
        This theme of community service rolled into the election that we've just seen, with five dedicated candidates raising their hands. Putting yourself forward for public office is not an easy decision, so I say well done for a thoughtful and respectful campaign to former federal member for Bass Geoff Lyons; policeman and youth advocate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; Councillor Rob Soward; and Vivienne Gale. Together with successful candidate Nick Duigan, they highlighted what a healthy democracy is all about. I take this opportunity to congratulate Nick, whom I got to know well through the campaign. Nick is known in Tasmania as the host of a fishing show but, along with the voters of Windermere, I saw his love and dedication to the community. His background as a small business owner and ambassador for community organisations will serve him well in his new role, working in the interests of the diverse Windermere community. Congratulations, Nick. I know you will do the community proud.
