       Dear Mrs Irwin

      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post-petition request for post office at Jewells NSW
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letters dated 27 May 2008 and 2 June 2008 concerning petitions submitted for the Committeeâ€™s consideration requesting a post office at Jewells, NSW.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day to day running of the organisation, including all operational matters. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that senior management from its NSW administration met with the petition sponsor, Ms Jill Hall MP, in late March to discuss her interest in the establishment of a postal outlet within the Jewellstown shopping centre redevelopment. I understand a further meeting has taken place with Ms Hall, as well as ongoing discussions between Australia Post and the owner/developer and leasing agent. Another on-site meeting with the owner/developer and leasing agent is scheduled for 25 July.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has also advised that it has received few direct approaches, including from the local business community, requesting a postal outlet at Jewellstown.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has also informed me that, at this stage, no decision has been reached.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the
       <b>
        Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy,
       </b>
       to a petition presented on 27 May and 3 June by
       <b>
        The Speaker
       </b>
       (from 1530 citizens)
