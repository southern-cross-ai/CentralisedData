        I rise in the House of Representatives to recognise the 2018 school leaders from the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        schoolsâ€”549 outstanding young Australians from 26 local schools have answered the call of their communities to serve. It's important that we both encourage and nurture those young leaders in our society who are willing to step up. They've commenced their journey of discovery that if service is beneath them leadership is beyond them. These young Australians are learning the timeless truths that leadership starts with service. The students I'm recognising here today all put their hand up to serve their local community. This is something worth acknowledging here.
       </p>
       <p>
        These schools are: A.B. Paterson College, Arundel State School, Biggera Waters State School,

        I've had the privilege of visiting all of these schools, and it's so pleasing to see a common theme across them of service. Congratulations to all the 2018 student leaders. I seek leave to table the names of 549 extraordinary young Gold Coast leaders who are stepping up to serve their community.
