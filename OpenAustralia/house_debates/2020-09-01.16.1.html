        Today I recognise the great work of Men in Bibs. No, Mr Speaker, they're not a group of messy eaters! This is an organisation whose goal is twofold. Firstly, to get more men and boys into the great sport of netball. As someone who has played in a mixed team a long time ago, I can say that netball is one of the fastest and most skilled games you can play. Secondly, as important as the sport is, at the core of Men in Bibs is a sense of self-worth, community and ensuring that men reach their own personal best and become mentors and examples to our youth. Their motto is about positivity, growth, learning and community. One quick glance at their Facebook site of Men in Bibs shows this is much more than a Saturday afternoon of sport. I would like to congratulate all of those involved with Men in Bibs and give a shout-out to one person in particular, Craig Waiwiri, who has led by example as a father, a person and a member of the community. In finishing off, we should always remember their moto: 'The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.' Well done, Men in Bibs.
