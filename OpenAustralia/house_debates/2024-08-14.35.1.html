       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the 80th birthday this week of one of my beloved residents in Pearce.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rigby" rel="nofollow">
         Eleanor Rigby
        </a>
        is a remarkable community leader who has made a significant impact on her community with her work with the Knit and Natter group, located at Pearsall Hocking Community Centre. Since founding the group in 2011, Eleanor has overseen its impressive growth from just six members to over 110, with ages ranging from 20 to 90.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Knit and Natter group knits clothing, blankets and shawls for various charities including cancer care,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Youth Futures as well as aged care facilities, hospitals and women's refuges. In 2019 alone they donated more than 12,000 items. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eleanor consistently checked in on the members and delivered yarn to their homes, ensuring the group could continue their charitable work despite the restrictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eleanor's dedication and commitment to the group's mission exemplifies her leadership and passion for community service. In recognition of her outstanding contributions, Eleanor Rigby was honoured as the City of Wanneroo's Senior of the Year in 2021. Her efforts have not only provided significant support for those in need but have also fostered a strong sense of community and friendship among the members of the Knit and Natter group. Happy 80th birthday, Eleanor. We thank you for all you do.
