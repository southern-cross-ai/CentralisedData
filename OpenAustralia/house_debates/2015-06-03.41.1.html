        May I first take time to acknowledge my students at Jamberoo Public School. Last November, Nowra was the location for the first ice information night. We listened to rehabilitation providers and health workers and also heard the stories, both tragic and heart-rending, of the effects of this rotten substance on our children, families and young people. Following that, one of the attendees, Maxine Meech, has coordinated regular meetings for a parent support group, which has enabled a number of parents to have the courage and strength to continue the battle to keep their children safe, knowing they are not alone. Julie Danser has held

        , who has inspired a group of students to gather, meet and work on ideas.

       <p>
        On Wednesday, 10 June, we will be having an ice task force meeting with a difference in Ulladulla. We will of course be having representatives from all the groups mentioned but also members of the police force, mental health workers and other professionals who are affected by this behaviour-changing and dangerous drug that we are committed to addressing. We will be workshopping the questions, gathering the anecdotal experiences and preparing the community to lead and resolve their suggestions for ideas to go forward. The meeting, at the civic centre at 7 pm, is to engage as many in the community as possible to bring their thoughts and ideas forward. We all know that, whether in government, medical services, police services or other community groups, we absolutely must work together. There is no solution without complete cooperation.
