        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with

        , who says that the government's response to COVID-19 is an act of hysteria because the virus has only led to the deaths of 'quite unwell elderly people'. If not, why is the minister for energy co-hosting a boardroom dinner with Mr Creighton to raise money for the Liberal Party's Eden-Monaro campaign?

           We're not going to have a ballot on the ruling; I'm just going to make the ruling, okay? There were certainly two questions. The second one, I think, struggles to be in order. I'm happy to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business.

            The purpose of the question is to ask whether or not the Prime Minister agrees with the comments that were quoted in the question. The second part of the question is clearly framed at the beginning with 'If not'—so, if the Prime Minister does disagree, why are these sorts of things happening with one of his own ministers?

               <p>
                I don't agree with those comments. What we have done over these many months we have been combating the COVID-19 global pandemic is been conscious right from the start of the need to address both the health challenge and the economic challenge. Now, there are extreme views in this debate. There are more extreme views which say that there is nothing going on here, and there are others who say that more extreme action should be taken in terms of measures. It's a free country, and people can express whatever views they wish on these matters. I'm not seeking to express any judgement against the individual that has been referred to in the question in any way, shape or form. I just happen to have a different point of view—a point of view that has been informed by the government's actions, which shows that we took early, strong and important actions that have both protected lives and protected livelihoods.
               </p>
               <p>
                Australia stands out around the world as being the leader both on the economic response, as is demonstrated by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
                 OECD
                </a>
                figures, and the health response, which has been demonstrated by the much lower death rate in Australia; it's 100 times more in overseas countries. Had we not taken the decision to take action on health, then we would not be in the position today to address the economic opportunities as we come out of this crisis. We are well ahead of where we'd hoped to be. There are different experiences in different countries. The Treasurer just made mention of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                 New Zealand
                </a>
                ; they went to a full lockdown, and their expected position on their economy is that it will be down 8.9 per cent this year. We didn't go to that extreme, and we're looking at a five per cent reduction. Every country will make its choices. We've made the right choices.
