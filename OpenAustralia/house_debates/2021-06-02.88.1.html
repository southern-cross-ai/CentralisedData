        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Will the minister update the House about how the Morrison government's actions to strengthen our border protection are setting the foundation for our continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a safer and more secure Australia, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for his question and for his very strong interest in national security. Our government makes absolutely no apologies for doing what needs to be done to keep Australians safe and secure, and the security of our borders and the safety of our families and our businesses are absolutely critical to our continued economic recovery. We were swift to act at the start of the pandemic, and it's widely recognised that our international border controls have played a major role in Australia's successful containment of the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister has said, our international borders will only open when it's safe to do so. But I want to assure the Australian people we are carefully planning for the future and working on ways to facilitate a safe reopening based on medical advice and our capacity to manage increased arrivals. We know that border restrictions that have been necessary during the pandemic have had a significant impact on many Australians, particularly those who are wanting to be reunited with loved ones, but strong borders are essential at this time, and, of course, the coalition government has a strong track record on border security.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the first things that I did when I was sworn in as the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         was send a very clear message that our government remains absolutely determined when it comes to border policy so that people smugglers don't think they can start back up their evil trade. Secure borders are now more important than ever, and the risk of uncontrolled arrivals to our shores at this time is more significant than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through Operation Sovereign Borders, which we are continuing to fund through the budget, we have achieved what others said was impossible. Next month it will be seven years since the last successful people-smuggling venture reached our shores. Turnbacks continue to work, with 873 people from 38 people-smuggling boats returned to their country of departure or to their home country. It is a matter of fact that more than 1,200 people drowned at sea and more than 50,000 people arrived illegally in Australia under the Labor government, and this government will never allow that to happen. Our government remains absolutely laser focused on the national interest, on protecting our sovereignty and on keeping the Australian community safe.
