        Every Australia Day local councils in my electorate acknowledge the good work and achievements of individuals who give their time for the benefit of others. This year my cousin, William Anschau, was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Hunters Hill
        </a>
        Council's Young Citizen of the Year Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        William was educated at Hunters Hill Public School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph's College
        </a>
        . His impressive list of achievements and his long record of volunteering make him an example of someone who has used his own talents to make a difference in our community. William was an active volunteer whilst at St Joseph's College, spending five years helping disabled children at the annual Marist children's holiday camp. Since leaving school, he has continued his voluntary work, including as a bus assistant for the Ryde-Hunters Hill Community Transport Service, and helping out with the Hunters Hill Community Centre and the Meals on Wheels organisation. He is also an active member of the Hunters Hill
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        and is well known for his volunteer work at local events, including the Moocooboola Festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        William has said that everyone should look to help others. He is right. Although he has had some of his own health challenges, these have never stopped him from making a difference in society. He is an optimistic and positive young man who is an excellent example to all young people on the benefits of service. It is his actions that make the Hunters Hill community a better place for all, and he is well deserving of this award.
