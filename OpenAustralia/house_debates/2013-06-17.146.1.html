       <p>
        This federal election is about the future, a future in which we as Liberals will carry forward our defining principles: the right of all Australians to be free to determine how they live their lives, eschewing government prescription; the belief that a hand up is always better than a hand out; the idea that equality of opportunity is the great leveller in our society, not subsidy; and the principle that if you work hard you should be fairly rewarded, not penalised. Indeed, we are bound by the idea that liberalism is the path to fairness and the knowledge that, conversely, enforced equality never liberates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our nation deserves and is crying out for a prosperous economy. To make that happen, we need to unlock the potential of the Australian people by removing government from their lives. So, if the coalition is elected in September, what we will see is a new order—a new mantra. It is called 'small government and big citizens'. This transformation will be anchored in 12 distinct layers of policy priority. First, the coalition will build a strong, diversified economy by lowering taxes and delivering more jobs, higher real wages and better services for Australian families. We will then secure this prosperity by reining in the budget, cutting waste and reducing debt. The coalition are proven prudent financial managers, safeguarding the Australian economy from economic shocks. We will help families get ahead by abolishing the carbon tax, the world's largest carbon tax, which has resulted in spiralling electricity and gas prices. Fourth, by reducing taxes and regulations, we will help build small businesses that grow and expand to employ more Australians. We will cut red and green tape costs by $1 billion every single year. We will create even stronger jobs growth by building a more diversified five-pillar economy underscored by manufacturing innovation, advanced services, agriculture, education and research, and mining. By growing this bigger and more productive economy, we will generate one million new jobs over the next five years and two million jobs within 10 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our vast, decentralised nation, we are committed to building more modern roads and infrastructure to get things moving. A special emphasis will fall on reducing the bottlenecks on our gridlocked major roads and highways. We will deliver better services, including health services, by increasing cooperation with the states and territories and by putting local communities in charge of improved performance at hospitals. Likewise, we will deliver better education by giving communities, parents and principals carriage in the running of their local schools. On the environment, we will take direct action to reduce carbon emissions within Australia, not overseas, as well as establishing a 15,000-strong standing green army to clean up the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will deliver stronger borders with proven policies. Finally our united, experienced team will deliver a strong and stable government set on restoring confidence and accountability. We are the team that will not only rebuild the economy but also renew the bonds of trust between the Australian people and the parliament. It is that trust which contrasts keenly against the litany of broken promises from this federal Labor government. Last year the Treasurer said, 'Tonight I announce four years of surpluses.' This year he delivered a $19.4 billion deficit and projected a deficit of $18 billion for 2013-14. Labor promised no carbon tax, and yet we have got a carbon tax, record deficits and, in the budget, the scrapping of tax and family payments. In 5½ years the Rudd-Gillard government has created 21,000 new regulations and 39 new or increased taxes. But you cannot tax or regulate a nation into prosperity. It just cannot be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        This September an important choice is before the Australian people: another three years of chaotic Labor with more taxes, waste, prescription and regulation or the election of a coalition government that will abolish the carbon tax, ease the cost-of-living pressures and create more jobs—a coalition that stands behind small government and big citizens. If given the opportunity, the coalition will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians.
