        There's been a lot of talk recently about land in and around

        airport, as there should be. But one piece of land we should focus on is

        and

        . The rights of landowners in Horsley Park and Cecil Park are being removed retrospectively and without consultation by the Berejiklian Liberal government in

        , presumably in consultation with the Morrison government, because it's the

        Horsley Park and Cecil Park are wonderful communities, rural communities, which I represent. They are five acre and 2½ acre blocks, a wonderful part of Sydney. It's often been the case that people with a five acre block choose to subdivide it and make it two 2½ acre blocks for their families. These rights have been removed by the Berejiklian government with not one word of consultation. Most people heard about it on Facebook through reports from the mayor, Counsellor Carbone. The people of Horsley Park have not been asked their views. Take the Trajkovic family: their parents bought a five acre block in 1994 and were planning to subdivide it for two children. Those rights have been removed. Gone. Why? Because a second runway will be built in 2064. Yet the rights of this family and other families at Horsley Park are being removed by the Liberal and National Parties. There has not been a word from the state member for Mulgoa about it. There's been no representation from the Liberal Party for this community. Well, they will be represented by the council, and they'll be represented by me here because this is a disgrace.
