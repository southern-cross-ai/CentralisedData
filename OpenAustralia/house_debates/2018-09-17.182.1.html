       <p>
        I was delighted to attend the official opening of the Options Theatre Company's new rehearsal and performance space at Tuggerah in my electorate of Dobell. Options Theatre Company is an exclusive and inclusive theatre company that has grown out of Options Disability Support, an organisation that has been helping people with disability and their families and carers on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for 25 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Options had outgrown their space at

        </a>
        , and I was able to support them with a federal government Stronger Communities grant of $20,000 to help them to move to their new space in Tuggerah. Also with the help of Bunnings in Tuggerah and Erina, Dulux paints, the Newcastle Permanent Charitable Foundation,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Brothers" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Mobil Australia, they have created a rehearsal and performance space as good as any that I've seen, and a cafe is in the works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community also answered the call for help, providing 100 vintage lampshades that are suspended from the ceiling in the rehearsal space. It's a spectacular effect, literally shining a light on the great work happening at Options Theatre Company. I had a tour of the new space prior to the opening with art director
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stu_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        and musical director Andrew Sampford. It's clear that they are passionate about their work and proud of their cast and crew.
       </p>
       <p>
        On opening night, that crew of actors, musicians, dancers, directors and technicians, all people living with a disability, came together to showcase their skills and their joy. It was lovely to be part of such a proud and appreciative audience and to see such a splendid production. Whether it's behind the scenes, on the stage or in the spotlight, Options Theatre Company is giving all its participants a chance to shine.
