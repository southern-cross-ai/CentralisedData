        The list of Cowan Centenary of Anzac projects will be delivered today to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans Affairs
        </a>
        . I would like to thank the members of the Cowan Centenary of Anzac grants committee who could participate in assessing the applications last week: Mike Gilmour, of the Ballajura
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        ; Wendy Tuffin, of the Wanneroo and Joondalup RSL; Councillor John Chester, of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        ; and Councillor Mel Congerton, of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         City of Swan
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        One particular project that certainly caught my eye was the project application from Marangaroo Primary School. This proposal was for a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        memorial site to be constructed near the undercover area, with the existing flagpole to be removed and reinstalled as the centrepiece of the monument. Twenty-two limestone blocks will create a mini-amphitheatre, paved with limestone bullnose pavers. The area will be flanked by two solid jarrah bench seats engraved with the Australian coat of arms. A commemorative brass plaque will also be installed in the limestone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to thank Mr Glenn Ross, the teacher who helped put this project together and also principal Karen Loan. But, above all, the way in which Marangaroo Primary School went about this was very engaging with the student body. They put it out to the students and asked for applications and proposals. The winning proposal was that of the year 6 head girl, Shynique Bicknell. Shynique wrote on her proposal:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If my design gets built I think it will change the way people think and see the school. Everyday people just walk past and not take any notice of the flag pole, but with my design the pole will stand out with pride. It will make everyone look and even think. You will be able to sit on the benches to relax/talk and think. My design will honour those soldiers who died and or survived the war for us. If you are struggling the flag pole memorial will motivate you to keep going because they did too, for us.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important project. My committee were certainly very interested in it and I hope that the department will sign off on the proposal. Through this sort of approach we will see a real focal point for commemoration not only at Marangaroo Primary School but also in the whole suburb of Marangaroo.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the future we might very well see many dawn services take place at Marangaroo and lots of local community involvement. I particularly congratulate Shynique Bicknell for being the winner of 87 proposals from within the school. That is a great endorsement for young people, who obviously have great respect for Anzac Day.
