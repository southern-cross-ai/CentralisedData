        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister’s rejection of the bipartisan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Baker-Hamilton strategy recommending a staged withdrawal of US forces to pressure the Iraqis to negotiate a political settlement between the Sunni and the Shia. Why does the Prime Minister reject a strategy that his own Minister for Foreign Affairs greeted as a good piece of work and one that drew all the right conclusions?

         As usual the Leader of the Opposition is misrepresenting not only what I say but also what the Minister for Foreign Affairs says. Let me go to the Baker-Hamilton report. Let me read to the House an excerpt from the Baker-Hamilton report. On page 37 it states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qaeda" rel="nofollow">
          Al Qaeda
         </a>
         would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me repeat that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those words are very close to the words of the national security estimate, which no doubt the Leader of the Opposition has read, in which it said amongst other things:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this Estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Iraqi Government
         </a>
         , and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.
        </p>
        <p>
         It went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISF" rel="nofollow">
          ISF

        <p class="italic">
         would be unlikely to survive as a non-sectarian national institution; neighboring countries—invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally—might intervene openly in the conflict ...
        </p>
        <p>
         and it goes on in similar vein. When challenged to state his own view as to the consequences of an American withdrawal by March 2008, the Leader of the Opposition has sought refuge in cherry picking Baker-Hamilton. That is what he has sought to do. The Leader of the Opposition has sought refuge in cherry picking Baker-Hamilton and he has ignored the conditionality of the proposition put in Baker-Hamilton. He has completely ignored the assessment that if there were a premature withdrawal in Iraq by the American forces there would be the consequences that have been outlined.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most that the Leader of the Opposition would say this morning on
         <i>
          AM
         </i>
         when he was asked about the consequences of an American defeat or withdrawal in circumstances of defeat was: it would be bad. The sum total of the Leader of the Opposition’s assessment of the consequences of an American withdrawal in circumstances depicted as defeat is that it would be bad. That is the one word: it would be ‘bad’. I think it would be worse than that. It would represent a catastrophe for the West. It would have serious security implications for this country. A humiliated, weakened America after a withdrawal from Iraq depicted as a defeat would be bad news for the world and it would be bad news for the security of Australia.

           First, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. I have been in Munich at the security conference there and I had the opportunity to talk with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
            US
           </a>

           and Democrat members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the German foreign minister and the defence minister, the Pakistani foreign minister, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
            NATO
           </a>
           Secretary General and the Swedish foreign minister. I also went to Ankara and met with the president, the foreign minister and the speaker of their parliament, who, Mr Speaker, sent his best wishes to you—I believe you are acquainted.
          </p>
          <p>
           The point is, in relation to the honourable member for Boothby’s question, that of course this list of people—and there were others—have a variety of different views over whether it was right or wrong to throw
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
            Saddam Hussein
           </a>
           out of office. But they are all united on one point—that is, a precipitate withdrawal from Iraq would be disastrous. It would be a victory for terrorists. It could draw neighbouring countries, such as Iran,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">
            Saudi Arabia
           </a>
           and possibly even Turkey, into the conflict. It would destabilise the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           as a whole. It would have disastrous consequences in the war against terrorism. It would embolden terrorists around the world and bring terrorism closer to Western countries. But, ultimately, it would also be a human disaster for the people of Iraq. They are suffering enough.

            Labor members interject, ‘What about now?’ They are suffering enough already. Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition would wish them to suffer more by the precipitate withdrawal of American troops? As the Prime Minister has pointed out, when the Leader of the Opposition—and before he was Leader of the Opposition, by the way, when he was the spokesman on foreign affairs—is asked, ‘What would be the consequences of an American withdrawal?’ he always ducks the question. On 17 October he was asked that question eight times and he decided it was not convenient to answer that question. Of course I know while I have been away he has been asked that question and has continued to duck it. He came up with this thought bubble that he might quote the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Study_Group" rel="nofollow">

                Iraq Study Group
               </a>
               , which is, to say the least, cherry picking, selective quoting and deeply misleading. The Iraq Study Group has been quoted by the Prime Minister, but it also said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The point is not for the United States to set timetables or deadlines for withdrawal, an approach ... we oppose.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is what the Iraq Study Group said. Labor members obviously have not read the report of the Iraq Study Group. There is no doubt about it: the international community believes it would be a mistake for America to withdraw precipitously and the Leader of the Opposition happens to think the reverse. The opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Barton, said, when

                 Yes, he says. But the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Study_Group" rel="nofollow">
                  Iraq Study Group
                 </a>
                 said that it could support a surge. So the Labor Party says it supports the Iraq Study Group; the Iraq Study Group said ‘we could ... support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilise Baghdad’. So when the Labor Party, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, desperately trying to find populist positions, starts flailing around on a national security issue, he is exposed, as he has always been exposed on national security issues, for being an opportunist and not a deep policy thinker.

Those of us in this nation who have only ever enjoyed peaceful democracy should be in awe of the courage of 10 million Iraqis who, in the face of the most terrible intimidation, have voted to embrace a democratic future. That is our goal. Another goal that we have is to avoid the consequences of a premature withdrawal. The consequences of a premature withdrawal have been pointed out by Baker-Hamilton—

                                                        I think that if coalition troops pull out prematurely then we will then have a humanitarian disaster—

And our strategy is also to avoid a precipitous withdrawal and a withdrawal of American forces in circumstances depicted as defeat.
