       <p>
        On Friday, 21 August, I was thrilled to be able to attend the annual general meeting of the Whittlesea University of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age" rel="nofollow">
         Third Age
        </a>
        at Epping Memorial Hall. I was even more thrilled to see such a full room of active and engaged members present. I take this opportunity to congratulate the newly elected members of the executive: Joe Felice as president, Kathy Lizio as vice-president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Palmer" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as secretary, and Margaret Mitten as treasurer. I congratulate them on their election, but also on their ongoing selfless contribution to a wonderful organisation. I was struck at the meeting by how frankly the executive members dealt with managing the challenges of their success to date—an organisation attracting hundreds of members—the challenges of finding suitable space to organise and then run such a wide range of activities that really do provide so much meaning and involvement for so many people in the Scullin electorate and in the wider communities of the city of Whittlesea. I look forward to working with the new executive, and all members of the Whittlesea U3A, in keeping people engaged in lifelong learning, keeping them socially connected and making an enormous difference to so many lives. I look forward to when I see them next not having to compete with a chocolate demonstration as well.
