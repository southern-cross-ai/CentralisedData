        On Saturday evening I attended the opening of the new clubrooms at Fraser Park, in the suburb of Victoria Park in my electorate of Swan. Fraser Park was originally named after James Macintosh Fraser, who represented the Victoria Park Ward on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Perth City Council
        </a>
        from 1928 to 1937.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fraser" rel="nofollow">

        died in 1961, but this marvellous park remains in his honour. The previous Curtin Victoria Park Cricket Club clubrooms that stood in the park were built in 1974 for $37,000. The lowest tenderer neglected to factor in the cost for plumbing fixtures. It was decided that sometimes it is worth having to pay a little bit extra to have access to running water and toilets, so the lowest tenderer lost out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The brand-new building, which opened on Saturday, was designed by architectural draughtsman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Myers" rel="nofollow">

        , a local resident of Victoria Park. The decision to start from scratch was really about keeping the wellbeing and equity of user groups in the wider community in mind. The existing different floor levels made universal access difficult.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Town" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Victoria Park has a commitment to building an inclusive community, where all people, regardless of whether they visit with wheelchairs, scooters or prams, can access our quality lifestyle facilities and services. The total cost of this excellent new facility was $758,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank the

         Town of Victoria Park
        </a>
        staff who have been instrumental in bringing this project to fruition. I thank staff from the town’s technical services, particularly Rod Grygic, who was involved from start to finish, and also Sue Ward Horner and Susan O’Donoghue, who, I am reliably informed, have been of great assistance, especially to the cricket club, over the years.
