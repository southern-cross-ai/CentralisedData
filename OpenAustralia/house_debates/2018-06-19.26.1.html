        Having been a local councillor for over 20 years, Korumburra's Bob Newton is passionate about his town and the people of his district, their stories and their connections to each other. It has led him to write his second book, titled

        historical park in Korumburra. This was an eight-year project for Bob in gathering and detailing the stories of local families and local roads. The book launch was a testament to the community's respect for Bob, with the room filled with family, friends, community members and local history buffs. Bob's book is about not only an individual's love for the district, its people and its families but also the stories and histories of the region. With over 500 streets, roads and lanes detailed—in many cases including photographs of the pioneering families—Bob's book covers the accidents, the challenges and the sacrifices that went into setting up the
