        I wish to congratulate Maroubra local and Rabbitohs legend

        . Loyalty in first-class sport in this day and age is a rarity. Most players will understandably play for the highest bidder, but not John Sutton. He always dreamed of wearing the red and green and playing for the club that represents his home and the area that he grew up in. John could have played, and was offered to play, for others clubs for more money, but he stuck by the Rabbitohs. That loyalty was rewarded in 2014 when he lifted the premiership trophy as the captain of the Rabbitohs to win their 21st premiership.

        He started his junior rugby league at Kensington United. That is same club that my father played for as a junior. Two weeks ago, I was privileged to join many members of our community at

        for the unveiling of a mural honouring John and his 300th game for the Rabbitohs. In front of family and friends, John spoke with great passion and emotion that day about what the Rabbitohs mean to him. He's the only Rabbitohs player in their 112-year history to reach this historic milestone. On behalf of our community, to you, Sutto, and to your family, thank you and congratulations. You represent everything that the Rabbitohs stand for.
