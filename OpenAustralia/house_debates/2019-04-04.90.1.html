        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Given that in the previous answer the Minister for the Environment said she was only seeking expressions of interest, how was she doing this for a program that, at the time, did not exist and had no guidelines? Does the minister stand by her earlier answer, or, when the media release went out announcing successful projects, did the member for Dunkley mislead his electorate?

         Thank you for the question. The date that we announced this program was 4 March. There was significant information out and available in the public, which is what the member for Dunkley relied upon in the three or four very good projects that he announced.

         I did, but there was enough information out in the public on 4 March. What we do know is that he has very good projects that he has identified for the Communities Environment Program. What have you got against Animalia Wildlife Shelter in Frankston? What's wrong with it? That's a very good project. We went there to talk about an expression of interest. What do you have against Friends of Langwarrin Outdoors and Waterways? Again, it's a very good group of committed environmentalists. And the South Eastern Centre for Sustainability—again, very good, committed local people.
