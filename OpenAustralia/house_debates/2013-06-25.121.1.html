        I rise to speak about something which is close to all of our hearts, and that is road safety. In 1982, on 17 December, the first random breath test was conducted in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . About 4.5 million random breath tests are carried out on New South Wales motorists every year, and there are only 5.5 million licence holders in the state. In 1982, the state's road toll stood at 1,253 deaths. Last year, it was 364, despite there now being 1.5 million more motorists.

        Whilst alcohol is still a problem on our roads, I would suggest that perhaps mobile phone usage is an even greater danger. I commend

        's iPromise campaign, which is asking readers to pledge not to speed, drive drunk or use mobile phones whilst driving. Last year more than 42,000 drivers were fined for using their mobile phones. Since the laws were toughened, making it illegal to touch a phone except when it is in a fixed cradle, only 20,000 fines have been issued, which is 20 fewer per day. Drivers face a $298 fine, which rises to $397 in school zones, and the loss of three demerit points or four in a school zone. They are commendable penalties because if you use your mobile phone you are going to be distracted. I drive a lot of kilometres around my electorate each year, as I am sure all the regional members, in particular, do. Quite honestly, in recent times I have noticed the number of drivers who veer when I am following them. Sometimes they even veer onto the incorrect side of the road when they are coming towards you. Quite often at night you can see blue flashes on their windscreens, which shows that they are using their mobile phones.

        Another campaign was started by Vicki Richardson, a woman in Victoria whose daughter, Brooke, tragically died using a mobile phone. She was texting: 'Are you still going to make it today?' Brooke died after hitting a tree while travelling at 100 kilometres an hour on a Victorian highway near Cobram, which has left that family absolutely devastated. I would urge people who may be reading this in the
        <i>

        to make sure they tell their loved ones not to use mobile phones while they are drivingâ€”and indeed not to use them themselves. It is a dreadful crime. It could take your life or it could take the life of somebody else. I commend the police for doing all they can to crack down on this absolute scourge of society. It is not necessary. As you drive up

        there is a sign warning people not to text. It is a dreadful thing to do, and people should cease doing it for their own sake as well as for the safety of others.
