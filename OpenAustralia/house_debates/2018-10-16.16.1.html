        On Sunday, before jumping on a plane to come down here, I attended Gone Fishing Day. Gone Fishing Day was held at the Darwin waterfront this year. Well done to AFANT, the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , and to the Northern Territory government, which supported the event, and to the local fishing clubs. And well done to all the stallholders, but in particular, Darwin Game Fishing Club, Palmerston Game Fishing Club and Darwin Flyrodders. It was a fantastic opportunity for members of the public to have a go at the fishing clinics, for the kids to do some colouring in and just really have a bit of an entry into fishing.

        Fishing is a wonderful part of the Northern Territory lifestyle. Even more than that, it's a great part of the Australian dream to be able to get out with your family and your mates and throw a line in. It's good for mental health but it's also good for our community. I really think that recreational fishing is important for our community. It's also good for tourism. Gone Fishing Day this year got off to a great start in that a local from Kakadu, Matt Rawlinson caught the first $10,000 fish and this season's million dollar fish. It's season 4 now. Well done to Matt. There are five $1 million fish out there to be caught. So come up to the Northern Territory.
