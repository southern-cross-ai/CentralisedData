        Rapid residential growth in Perth's northern suburbs has resulted in significant increases in traffic volumes. I have worked hard to improve road safety, in close cooperation with my local government counterparts Mayor Tracey Roberts and Mayor Troy Pickard, as well as with my state government colleagues the Hon. Albert Jacob
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
         MLA
        </a>
        , Jan Norberger MLA and the Hon. Peter Katsambanis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">

        . A number of local roads in the Moore electorate are on track to be made safer as a result of federal funding provided in the current budget for safety improvements such as traffic management treatments, antiskid surfacing, construction of new lanes, modifications to traffic signals and improved streetlighting.
       </p>
       <p>
        The $5.1 million in new federal funding for the local roads is in addition to the $209.1 million in Commonwealth funding received for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Freeway
        </a>
        extension. Five local intersections have received federal funding for safety improvements under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot
        </a>
        program. The busy intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmion_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Marmion Avenue
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenton_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Shenton Avenue
        </a>
        in Iluka has received an allocation of $310,000 to install predeflection and antiskid treatments on the south leg and rumble strips on the centre lines for the south, north and east legs of the roundabout. At the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joondalup_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Joondalup Drive
        </a>
        and Shenton Avenue in Joondalup, the sum of $246,000 has been provided to upgrade the intersection lighting. Further north, at the intersection of Marmion Avenue and Rochester Drive in Mindarie, $200,000 has been allotted to construct an acceleration lane in the Marmion Avenue median for right turning vehicles exiting Mindarie to merge more easily with southbound traffic on Marmion Avenue. Near

         Ocean Keys
        </a>
        shopping centre, at the intersection of Ocean Keys Boulevard and Key Largo Drive in Clarkson, $25,000 has been provided to upgrade existing streetlighting. In Kallaroo, at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfords_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Whitfords Avenue
        </a>
        and Dampier Avenue, $15,000 has been provided to modify the traffic control signals to remove right turn filter movements on Whitfords Avenue.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, funding from the Roads to Recovery program will be provided to our two local government authorities. This
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        will receive $1.96 million in federal funding, while the

         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        has been allotted $2.35 million, bringing the total allocation of Roads to Recovery funding to $4.31 million. I will continue to advocate for future federal funding for the widening of

        </a>
        to a dual carriageway between Joondalup Drive and Menchetti Road, the widening of Flynn Drive to a dual carriageway and the next phase of the extension of the Mitchell Freeway beyond Hester Avenue to Romeo Road.
