         Helen Brown

        of Yamba, an Indigenous woman doing wonderful work in our community. Helen won the Senior

         Volunteer of the Year
        </a>
        as well as the overall Volunteer of the Year at the 2020 North Coast Region Volunteer of the Year Awards. Helen is involved with many groups in our community. She is a board member of the Aboriginal Legal Service North Coast Region, a committee member for the Wirringa Baiya Aboriginal Women's Legal Centre, a volunteer for the Justice Advocacy Service and attends meetings of groups focused on drug and alcohol abuse. Importantly, she also does consultancy work between police and Aboriginal peoples. In all aspects she does everything she can to assist others. Helen helps write resumes, provides meals and clothes and helps get people to medical appointments. Recently Helen has started a social group of Indigenous women who have moved from across Australia to Yaygirr country. She said it's about ensuring Indigenous women don't feel isolated or a loss of identity when they've left their own communities. I want to pass on great thanks to Helen's family, who have also supported her throughout her endeavours. I know spending time with her grandkids and great-grandkids is very important to her. Helen, you're a woman of empathy, dedication and true community service. I want to thank you for what you do for our community, and congratulations on your award.

         John Murphy
        </a>
        , or 'Spud', has retired after 60 years of service to the bush fire brigades in Australia. He joined the bush fire brigade in Dural, Sydney, at 19 years old and served there for 20 years. Then, when Spud moved to Nana Glen in 1980, 40 years ago, he joined the Glenreagh fire brigade, where he served for another 40 years. He has held a position in the brigade the entire time he has been there, serving as brigade captain twice. His peers have considered him as a mentor and leader to the entire brigade. Spud says that how the brigades operate has changed drastically. It's much more high-tech now. There are lots more rules and regulations. Whilst he won't hold a position, members of the brigade will still be seeing Spud at the station regularly. He had retired before the recent bushfires but was still in the brigade shed on the radios and the phones. The admiration of his peers was on full display when they passed the hat around and proudly presented him with a gold watch at the brigade's
