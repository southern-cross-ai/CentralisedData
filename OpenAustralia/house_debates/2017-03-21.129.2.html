         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        , on 18 August 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        On July 19 1916, one of the bloodiest battles in modern warfare unfolded in northern France. By the time Australian troops took their place on the battlefield of northern France in July 1916, the massive Anglo-French offensive against entrenched German forces had begun in earnest. The first day of the Somme offensive, 1 July, is still regarded as the biggest disaster in the history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army" rel="nofollow">
         British Army
        </a>
        , with some 60,000 casualties—a third of whom died. Australian troops in France at the time numbered around 80,000, with a mixture of experienced commanders and soldiers who had cut their teeth at Gallipoli, and untested, raw recruits. It was those untested soldiers of the 5th Australian Division who would see the first major action involving Australians on the Western Front at the Battle of Fromelles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fromelles, designed as a feint to keep the Germans from moving their reserves from northern Flanders to the Somme, was believed by some to be doomed from the start.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Germans" rel="nofollow">
         The Germans
        </a>
        had every advantage. No-man's-land was up to 400 metres wide in places and flat and featureless, presenting German soldiers with unrestricted views of the Australian and British soldiers advancing in broad daylight. Concealed machine gunners, including those in a heavily fortified strong point known as the Sugarloaf, commanded fields of fire over the ground that any attackers had to cross, and in the rear were batteries of well-sited artillery. From high vantage points, German observers had panoramic views over the Allied trenches and rear areas. An Australian general said after the war that they could:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … count every sentry in our lines … and could at once, detect any preparation for attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        A more suitable site from which to launch a well-advertised attack could hardly have been found on the Western Front.
       </p>
       <p>
        During what became the most costly 24 hours in Australia's wartime history, Australian troops suffered more than 5,500 casualties in their attack towards Fromelles, including more than 1,900 dead and 470 captured. The British 61st Division suffered more than 1,500 casualties, and the German defenders almost as many.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July last year I attended the 100th anniversary commemorations for the battles of Fromelles and Pozieres in France. I attended the commemorative service and headstone dedication at Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery, followed by the national commemorative service at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
         VC
        </a>
        Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial near Fromelles. Then, on 23 July, I attended the national commemorative service at the 1st Australian Division Memorial at Pozieres in France. Over six weeks Australia suffered some 23,000 casualties at Pozieres, including nearly 7,000 dead—close to the total number of casualties at Gallipoli over eight months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost 100 kilometres to the south of Fromelles the 1st, 2nd and 4th Australian divisions had made their way through the countryside to the Somme sector, the landscape shifting from pleasant cornfields almost ready for harvest to endless horse lines, batteries of artillery, piled up shells, dumps of every description, debris and unburied dead. Charged with capturing the village of Pozieres, the Australians attacked just after midnight on 22-23 July. The 1st Division took the village and, soon after, encountered fierce counterattacks. A member of the Australian 9th Battalion wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The enemy came over the ridge like swarms of ants, rushing from shell hole to shell hole. Our men, full of fight and confidence, lined the parapet and emptied magazine after magazine into them. Some of the boys, anxious to get a shot at the Germans, pulled one another down from the fire step in the midst of the fight. Under this fire and that of our machine guns and the artillery, which tore great gaps in the advancing lines, the enemy attack withered.
       </p>
       <p>
        During a German counterattack on the night of 6-7 August, Lieutenant—later Captain—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Jacka" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Jacka

        , who had been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        in Gallipoli, inspired his men to charge the enemy, who had overrun their positions, and ferocious hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Seriously wounded in the fighting, Jacka was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Military Cross
        </a>
        for his gallantry, but many believed he had earned a bar to his VC. Five Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross for actions during the Battle of Pozieres.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the end of July 1916 Australia had taken over the entire front at Pozieres and turned its attention to capturing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouquet_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Mouquet Farm
        </a>
        , a strategically important stronghold for the Germans further to the north. Three Australian divisions—the 1st, 2nd and 4th—all took part in the fighting at Pozieres and Mouquet Farm. Thiepval and then Mouquet Farm eventually fell to the Allies and, in early 1917, the German army retreated to the

         The Battle
        </a>
        of Long Tan was one of the fiercest battles fought by Australian soldiers in the Vietnam War. It involved 105 Australians and three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealanders
        </a>
        from D Company, 6 RAR. A total of 17 Australians were killed in action in the battle and 25 were wounded, one of whom later died of his wounds, making it the most costly single engagement of the war. D Company were greatly assisted by ammunition resupply.
        <i>
         (Extension of time granted)
        </i>
        Earlier the previous day, the Australian operational base at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nui_Dat" rel="nofollow">
         Nui Dat
        </a>
        was hit by a surprise 20-minute barrage of Vietcong mortar and recoil rifle fire, which left 24 personnel wounded. The 1st Australia Task Force, comprising two inventory battalions, 5 RAR and 6 RAR, had only arrived in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">
         South Vietnam
        </a>
        two months prior. B company, from 6 RAR, set out the next morning to locate the enemy's firing position and, at midday on 18 August, D Company relieved B Company and took up the pursuit of the enemy. It was 3.40 in the afternoon when D Company's 11 Platoon clashed briefly with a small group of Vietcong just north of the derelict village of Long Tan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the enemy wore khaki and used
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK" rel="nofollow">
         AK
        </a>
        -47s, the dress and equipment of the main force Vietcong, and were not merely provincial troops went, initially, unnoticed by 11 Platoon. The D Company commander, Major Harry Smith, said, 'At first the penny didn't drop.' Over the next 30 minutes it became clear that the Australians were facing a much larger force than expected, and 11 Platoon came under devastating small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades from almost all sides. The men were surrounded and pinned down. Within 20 minutes the leading group of Australians had one-third of their men killed or wounded. Torrential monsoon rain broke out and over the next 3½ hours intense fighting ensued, including waves of enemy infantry attacks by a force with a vastly superior numerical advantage. What was thought, at the start of the battle, to be an enemy force of fewer than 150 turned out to be an opposition of more than 2,000 troops. Australian artillery began to fire in support of the pinned-down Australians, adjusting the shellfire with information from the embedded New Zealand forward observation officer. While the bombardment took a heavy toll on the enemy, the besieged D Company was isolated and vulnerable. It was outnumbered almost 10 to one; annihilation seemed inevitable.
       </p>
       <p>
        At around 7 pm that night, Australian armed personnel carriers, containing members of A Company, broke through the enemy line and drove them off. The Australians withdrew into the dark. Two Australians, wounded but alive, were found on the battlefield the following day. The bravery, tenacity and sacrifice of the Australian and New Zealand soldiers at Long Tan has come to symbolise Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War.

        Last year was significant for some of the most significant events of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . In 2016 we commemorated the 75th Anniversary of the sinking of the

        by the German raider
        <i>
         Kormoran
        </i>
        . We remembered this tragedy for Australia's Navy and we remembered the high price that comes with service and sacrifice. The loss of the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        and its 645 crew was a devastating blow to the loved ones of those on board, as it would be decades before the wreck and their last resting place would be found. Last year also marked the 75th anniversary of one of the Australian Defence Force's most famous exploits: the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tobruk" rel="nofollow">
         Siege of Tobruk
        </a>
        . This eight-month long siege saw allied forces—more than two-thirds of them Australians—hold out against the German Afrika Korps. In Canberra I commemorated and remembered with 25 surviving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats_of_Tobruk" rel="nofollow">
         Rats of Tobruk
        </a>
        . It was a privilege and an honour to listen to the stories of the bravery of ordinary Australians in extraordinary circumstances. More than 15,000 Australians fought as part of the allied force defending Tobruk and its harbour.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a related event, we also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the sinking of the HMAS
        <i>
         Parramatta
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </i>
        , sunk by a torpedo fired by the German submarine U559. One hundred and thirty-eight Australians lost their lives in the wreck; only 24 survived. The
        <i>

        has been instrumental in securing safe passage for valuable fuel and food to besieged allied forces in Tobruk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the Mediterranean, we also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Battles of Greece and Crete. These battles, where over 17,000 Australians served, so many Australians only survive due to the assistance of the local population. It has created a firm bond between our countries. Sadly, nearly 600 Australians were killed, almost 750 were wounded and more than 5,100 were taken as prisoners. Tragically, the local population suffered a heavier price with more than half a million Greeks having lost their lives. Seventy-five years on, we commemorated the service and sacrifice of these men and women, Greeks and Australians, at the Hellenic Memorial on Anzac Parade.

               <p>
                I thank the minister for his comprehensive coverage of a number of significant events. There are many commemorations taking place of significant parts of our military history. It is important that we acknowledge and pay tribute to the brave men and women who have served and sacrificed for our country. As many members may be aware, the centenary of Anzac began in 2014 and encompasses a number of significant anniversaries. These occasions provide us with the opportunity to pause and reflect on the nature of service and the enduring legacy of those who fought and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Of course, in addition to this, there have been many anniversaries and significant moments of conflict have followed.
               </p>
               <p>
                In 2006, we saw a number of significant anniversaries, from the 50th anniversary of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
                 Battle of Long Tan
                </a>
                to the 100th anniversary of Fromelles and Pozieres. Included with this, as the minister rightly identified, there have been other significant events interspersed with a number of equally important commemorative services. All of these have given us the opportunity to remember those who served and those who were left behind. While each of these battles were separated in time and distance, one of the enduring commentaries that come from Australian sacrifice and service is that the spirit of Anzac shone through on all these occasions. Our soldiers' courage in adversity, enduring mateship and self-sacrifice are qualities for which Australians are known.
               </p>
               <p>
                Given that the minister has provided a comprehensive summary of the commemorative events that took place in 2016, when this motion was first moved, perhaps it is fitting that, at the end of this discussion, I discuss commemorative events which will be coming up in 2017. 2017 has seen and will see a number of significant anniversaries commemorated. In February this year we commemorated the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore, and the service and sacrifice of all Australian prisoners of war was recognised. I was honoured to attend the official event in Ballarat on 15 February which commemorated the brave actions of many men and women. The fall of Singapore saw the Japanese forces stream into Singapore by the north-west of the island. The Australian defenders were spread too thinly and were forced back by the invaders. Our troops continued to fight, but, late in the day on 15 February, the British commander surrendered, and 15,000 Australians were taken prisoner.

                , the Japanese took 22,000 Australians as prisoners of war, subjecting them to nightmarish conditions. Eight thousand of those men never came home.
               </p>
               <p>
                The fall of Singapore also had long-lasting repercussions on the international stage, altering our relationship with Britain and aligning us more closely with the

                 US
                </a>
                , while, at home, the loss of our men and the treatment of prisoners of war continues to be felt. Its anniversary, 15 February, is an important commemoration which enables us to reflect on the courage displayed by these men, as well as by nurses, and on the cost of war.
               </p>
               <p>
                This commemoration was followed by, on 19 February, the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. This event has long been remembered as the most ferocious enemy attack on Australian soil.

                s and the British mounted troops marched through the dark towards Beersheba. At dawn, the British 53rd, 60th and 74th divisions, supported by artillery bombardment, attacked a five-kilometre-long entrenchment position. The battle continued through the day, and the men of the ANZAC Mounted Division made slow progress. It was not until 3 pm when the ANZACs were close enough to seize the hill. With time running out, the 4th

This enabled the British imperial force to break the Ottoman line near Gaza and advance into Palestine. While the 4th and 12th Light Horse only saw 31 killed and 36 wounded, they captured over 700 men. The fall of Beersheba swayed the battle against the Turks in Palestine and changed the history of the

                . The spirit which was forged on the fields of Gallipoli has been seen again and again. It was seen on the battlefields of Singapore and carried through to the Battle of Long Tan. This is the spirit which our current serving ADF members carry with them, and through our current serving ADF members the legacy of our serving men and women of the past lives on. Lest we forget.
