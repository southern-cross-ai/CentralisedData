        I have spoken many times in this place about the outstanding scientists and researchers based in my electorate of Ryan. We have some remarkable minds—from Professor Ian Frazer and his vaccine to treat cervical cancer to Professor Maree Smith and her recent success with chronic pain treatment. I could not be more proud to announce that yesterday Professor Perry Bartlett, the founding director of the Queensland Brain Institute, was awarded the 2015

        Florey Medal. Not only has Professor Bartlett transformed our understanding of the brain by challenging the opinion that adult brains were fixed and unchangeable but also he has also established the institute that focuses completely on neurological research.

        The CSL Florey Medal is one of Australia's most prestigious science awards. Established in 1998 by the Australian Institute of Policy and Science, the medal is named in honour of Australian Nobel Prize-winning scientist

        Over the past 30 years, Professor Bartlett has made a series of groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience. His discovery of the presence of stem cells in the adult brain has given people with brain injuries and diseases—and their families—significant hope for future treatment. Professor Bartlett began his research into the brain in the late 1970s. In 1982 he predicted the presence of stem cells in the brain. Ten years later he was able to prove that theory when he found stem cells in mice embryos and then in adult mice. Almost another decade after that he was able to isolate the stem cells in the adult brain and prove that the brain is an ever-changing organ.

        His establishment of the Queensland Brain Institute in 2003 has been crucial to some significant neurological discoveries in recent years. Starting out in 2003 with just 10 researchers, the institute now has more than 500 staff and hosts a new generation of innovative neuroscientists, including Professor Jurgen Gotz, who has recently had a breakthrough in non-invasive ultrasound technology which shows promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's. The Queensland Brain Institute's Centre for Ageing Dementia Research is the first facility in Australia focused solely on the prevention and treatment of dementia. Most recently, Professor Bartlett's has used exercise to reverse effects of dementia and recover memories in mice. Next year he will start human trials on people with dementia to see if exercise has the same effect on our brains. Professor Bartlett is hopeful these discoveries will lead to potential treatments for dementia and possibly even for depression. Professor Bartlett is truly deserving of this honour. Since its inception in 1998, only nine other scientists have been honoured with this award, including Professor Ian Frazer. Congratulations, Professor Perry Bartlett.
