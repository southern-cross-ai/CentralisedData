       <p>
        I rise this morning to make mention of an extremely important project that I am currently working on in my electorate. The Bayside of Bonner takes in the port of Brisbane, the third-busiest and the fastest growing port in Australia. The Port of Brisbane Corporation has worked tirelessly to drive business forward and, as a result, Brisbane’s port is now booming and rapidly expanding each year. The Chief Executive Officer of the Port of Brisbane Corporation, Mr Jeff Coleman, has played an integral role in fostering this significant trade growth, and I take this opportunity to commend him on his outstanding leadership and vision.
       </p>
       <p>
        While a first-class port has emerged, unfortunately it is still barely supported by a second-class road network. The

        is a critical infrastructure issue that needs to be addressed urgently if ongoing economic prosperity is to be ensured.

        , I had the great pleasure of bringing my colleague the Minister for

        , on site to personally assess this infamous road network. The first stretch of the motorway to the port was an easy, comfortable drive, but the quality of road soon disintegrated and we were left to negotiate a hazardous stretch of road—the same road that commuters, trucks and all transporters must battle each day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Port of Brisbane Motorway is on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
         AusLink
        </a>
        network and, while the federal government is committed to the scheduled upgrade in 2010, work needs to begin as soon as possible. This is what I will continue to push for. The current state of the motorway is detrimental to continued expansion and economic growth. The road needs attention, and it simply cannot wait another four years. Traffic levels, congestion and accidents on the road network are constantly increasing: total traffic to the port increased by an alarming 62 per cent between January 2003 and November 2005. Heavy vehicle traffic also increased by 79 per cent during that same period. The infamous ‘rollover bend’ is just one section of the motorway in desperate need of upgrade. The bend is well-known to and loathed by truck drivers because of the many accidents and deaths that have already resulted from this dangerous bend.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost of the motorway upgrade is $150 million. While I will continue to appeal to my senior colleagues Minister Truss and Minister Lloyd for the project to be earmarked for AusLink funding in 2008 or earlier, I also call on the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lucas" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Lucas
        </a>
        , to offer a Queensland contribution of $50 million to advance the work as soon as possible. The Port of Brisbane Corporation has my full support, and I urge that funding for this project be fast-tracked.
