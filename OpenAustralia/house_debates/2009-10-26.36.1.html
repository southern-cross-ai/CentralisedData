         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question, because I know he has a significant interest in this issue, as do his constituents in

         . The fact is that dangerous climate change poses fundamental risks to Australia’s environment and to our livelihood. These risks are increasingly well understood by experts, by scientists and by the Rudd government. Earlier this year I released
         <i>
          Australia’s biodiversity and climate change
         </i>
         :
         <i>
          a strategic assessment of the vulnerability of Australia’s biodiversity to climate change
         </i>
         . The report says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Biodiversity is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change … Many of Australia’s most valued and iconic natural areas, and the rich biodiversity they support, are among the most vulnerable to climate change. They include the

         </a>
         , the Queensland Wet Tropics and the Kakadu wetlands.
        </p>
        <p>
         It goes on to say that we are already seeing changes that are consistent with climate change impacts. For example, fire regimes in southern Australia—which we have witnessed in their tragic consequences—have been changing. This is consistent with a drier and a hotter climate. We have seen eight mass bleaching events since 1979 on the Great Barrier Reef triggered by unusually high sea surface temperatures. The report also makes some alarming predictions about the ecological impact of dangerous climate change:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … for tropical rainforests, higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns – longer dry periods between intense rainfall events – will increase the probability that fires penetrate into rainforest vegetation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Freshwater fish species, the report says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … are vulnerable to reductions in water flows and water quality and, in addition, have a limited capacity to migrate to new waterways.

           I repeat, in an important report, the
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
             Great Barrier Reef
            </a>
            outlook report 2009
           </i>
           , which I released last month, there was confirmation of significant threats to the reef. As we know, the Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia’s and the world’s great natural assets. It is worth some $6 billion a year and supports over 63,000 jobs in fishing, tourism, and cultural and recreational industries. Critically, a two-degree rise is expected to cause serious damage to the Great Barrier Reef, with experts predicting a shift from hard coral dominated reefs to seaweed dominated reefs. Worryingly, from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Marine_Science" rel="nofollow">
            Institute of Marine Science
           </a>
           , research shows us that calcification rates in large boulder corals have declined some 15.2 per cent throughout the Great Barrier Reef since 1990. This is absolutely unprecedented, at least in the past 400 years. So there are significant risks to our environment, risks to our economy, risks to our unique ecosystems and our biodiversity, risks to productive landscapes and risks to industries. Report after report sends these alarm bells well and truly ringing.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is why it is absolutely critical that Australia plays its part in reducing our own emissions. It is absolutely critical to recognise that we do not have any time to wait. The science is in and the risks are real and already very present. The only excuse for continuing climate change inaction, for continued delay, is if you do not accept the risks—if you continue to reject the evidence, if you continue to deny the science. If you do accept that Australia has so much to lose from dangerous climate change, then it follows that the sooner we take responsibility and transform our economy for a low-emissions future, the lower the costs and greater the benefits will be. That is what this government is bringing forward with the
