         AFL
        </a>
        is the only elite professional sporting code in the world without a single male player to publicly come out as gay—not one, past or present. You may be wondering why that is. The vast majority of young LGBTIQA+ youth experience discrimination in sport, with many self-excluding entirely. According to

         Out in the Fields
        </a>
        —the first international study conducted into gay athletes and homophobia in sport—the constant use of homophobic language in the AFL is a key factor in understanding why players hide their sexuality.

        FL Players Association released the second edition of their insights and impact report in June. The report shares the collective insights, perspectives and experiences of AFL and AFLW players. A key insight published was the players' description of a 'culture of silence; in the code, in which they felt 'threatened by the potential consequences of speaking out'. Nowhere in the report was there any mention of the queer players who have not felt safe enough to be open about who they are.
       </p>
       <p>
        This outcome from the report should come as no surprise. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of the AFL just this year said that the first male player to come out will have to carry a burden. Though our community is strong, it should not be our burden alone to fix such a broken culture. It is incredibly clear that more needs to be done. The don't ask, don't tell situation that has been fostered in the AFL is systemic and beyond disappointing. For now, the only legacy the AFL has created is a culture of silence.

        The health and social benefits gained from participating in inclusive, welcoming sporting environments are well established. Diversity in teams is good for sport. Just last month, we united behind the Matildas in their incredible World Cup campaign, a team featuring a substantial number of queer players. In any workplace, diverse teams are better able to solve complex problems and exhibit a high level of creativity and a broader thought process. By allowing employees, athletes and volunteers to bring their full selves to the sport, clubs will see a positive impact on productivity, on-field performance and tenure. We deserve to feel safe, respected and valued, living our lives as equals, free from discrimination.
       </p>
       <p>
        The A-Leagues have implemented multiple education programs to emphasise the importance of diversity and inclusion across all levels of sport, in addition to new technology to moderate and filter homophobic comments directed to clubs and players' social media. The AFL should be a leader in this space, not dragging its heels.
