        I move:

        That the amendments be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank particularly Senator David Pocock for his engagement on this legislation in good faith. His office has engaged constructively with myself and my office staff, and I'd like to thank him very much for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator David Pocock has proposed a number of amendments that, I can advise, the government will be supporting. These amendments relate to ensuring that appointments to the board of the High Speed Rail Authority and to the position of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        are the result of a merit based process as well as an amendment concerning the disclosure of the interests of board members to the minister in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Accountability Act
        </a>
        2013. As I've already made very clear, the board of the High Speed Rail Authority has to be a skills based board. It's a really complex and important project for the nation. I'm absolutely determined that the government appoints the board on merit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also very grateful that Senator David Pocock took into account the issues around gender equity and the importance of getting far more women on boards, particularly in my portfolio. I thank him for understanding and engaging in that as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that this is a very different approach than that to board appointments made under my portfolio by the previous government. It's one that I am in the process of trying to clean up, particularly when it comes to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , and I know the Attorney-General is trying to deal with it in relation to the
