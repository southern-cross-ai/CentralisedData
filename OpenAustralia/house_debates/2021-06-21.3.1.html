        I present the 27th report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petitions" rel="nofollow">
         Petitions
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Committee
        </a>
        for the 46th parliament, together with 38 petitions and 87 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented.
       </p>
       <p>
        These petitions include 37 e-petitions, and one paper petition. When the e-petitions platform was created it was with the intent of being no more prohibitive than creating or signing a paper petition, and now most petitioners engage with petitioning through the online platform. Despite this, paper petitions remain an important way to engage communities and gather signatures. The standing orders require paper petitions:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Further, the committee's webpage includes helpful advice on how to prepare a petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, since my last presentation in May the committee has continued to receive and consider petitions on a diversity of topics. More than half of the petitions I present today concern matters related to the COVID-19 virus and the challenges it brings to our everyday lives, while many ministerial responses also focus on addressing the public's concerns regarding the virus. Other matters of concern to petitioners which are included in today's report include taxation, child care and rural health care. These petitions included in today's report will also be referred on to ministers for their response.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I am also pleased to draw to your attention the work of the Petitions Committee as part of its inquiry into the House petitioning system relating to security and accessibility. The committee looks forward to sharing its findings with the House when available.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you Mr Speaker, I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.
