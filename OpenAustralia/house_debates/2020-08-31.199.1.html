        I want everyone in my community of Lindsay to have the opportunity to learn. regardless of their age. That is why I am really pleased to support Adult Learners Week. Learning has the ability to improve lives, from improving health outcomes and wellbeing to building confidence and staying informed and involved. We want to invest in lifelong learners. In my electorate of Lindsay I have connected with local organisations supporting lifelong learners, like the Nepean Community College. Eric and the team run a tech-savvy seniors' program for Australians. They have kept the program going throughout coronavirus, taking their digital literacy classes to Zoom, and they even have a 93-year-old woman who has continued with the classes because she wanted to learn how to connect with her grandchildren online. There are so many opportunities available for people in

         Western Sydney
        </a>
        to ignite their passion for lifelong learning. We have Western Sydney University,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and community colleges. I am really proud that they are in the electorate of Lindsay. In Adult Learners Week opportunities to learn have never been more accessible, from classes around computer skills to getting started with online banking, cooking, arts and crafts, general education and job skills. For more information or to book a class you can go to adultlearnersweek.org. I hope everyone in the community of Lindsay always gets an opportunity to learn, regardless of age.
