        . I got to know him while I worked at SBS. We became good friends, forging a bond over our shared passion and love for football, but he also generously shared with me the knowledge and the wisdom he accumulated over decades. He showed me kindness and made me laugh with his sometimes salty humour. I will miss him so much: his irreverence, his wit, his infectious laughter, his passion for and knowledge of the game he loved, the world game—the game he did so much to do promote to the magnificent heights of shared passion among his fellow Australians.

        Les is a national icon who did so much to grow the world game and to champion multicultural Australia. He deserves nothing less than the full symphony of tribute and respect.

        My love and condolences go out to his family and friends. My thoughts are with you all. He was, I know, so important to you, such an important part of your lives, and you all know that he was an important part of this nation's life. Not just the football community but the whole nation mourns his passing. Goodbye Lesomundo, my friend. Thank you for all you have done for football and for the people you have informed, delighted, entertained and loved over a wonderful life. Vale Les Murray.
