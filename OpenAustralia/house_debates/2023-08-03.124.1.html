       <p>
        Last Sunday, 30 July, marked the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, with the theme being, 'Reach every victim of trafficking; leave no-one behind.' Here today I'd like to reaffirm the Albanese Labor government's commitment to tackling these abhorrent crimes and the extensive work that we're doing to ensure that no-one is left behind. According to the Global Slavery Index, there are currently 49.6 million people experiencing modern slavery across the world. Victims and survivors of modern slavery have been denied their basic human rights and have experienced unimaginable suffering, exploitation and harm. Modern slavery can be very complex and take many different forms. Human trafficking, forced marriage, forced labour, servitude and debt bondage are just some of the ways that slavery presents itself in modern society. At the very heart of it, all types of modern slavery are about exploitation and taking freedoms away from the more vulnerable people in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government made an election commitment to tackle modern slavery, with a focus on prevention and disruption initiatives as well as improved programs for survivors to access the support they need. I was privileged last month to address the Modern Slavery Conference in Melbourne, which brought together governments, experts in the field, police and, very importantly, those with lived experience of modern slavery. The value of people with lived experience of modern slavery being able to safely share their experiences and insights cannot be overemphasised.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our 2023-24 budget, our government committed $5.3 million to establish an antislavery commissioner, and we committed an additional $24.3 million in funding over four years for the Support for Trafficked People Program. The program seeks to address the immediate needs of survivors while supporting them to rebuild their lives and achieve the best possible health, community, education and employment outcomes. We've also announced a pilot commencing mid next year that will enable survivors to come forward and receive support from the program without having to first speak to and notify the police.
       </p>
       <p>
        Improvements to our policy responses directly reflect feedback we receive from the community, from survivors and also from our incredible service providers. Just last week, I was able to visit a safe house for victims and survivors of modern slavery and to meet with those on the front line, who are working tirelessly to support victims and survivors to rebuild their lives. I commend them for the work they're doing. We must all work together when it comes to ensuring that no-one is subjected to modern slavery.
