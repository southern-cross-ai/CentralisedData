        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House why it is important that the Morrison-

        government continues to deliver its $100 billion infrastructure investment pipeline, and will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House the consequences of not building this critical infrastructure?

         I thank the member for Cowper for his question. He understands the immense benefits that our $100 billion pipeline of investment in infrastructure over the next decade is going to have for the people of Cowper—indeed, for the people right across this nation. The age of infrastructure has well and truly arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Cowper knows that the

         Bypass—which he very staunchly advocated for, with Gurmesh Singh, the state member for Coffs Harbour—is going to get people to where they need to be sooner and safer. It's going to transform the way people travel around the

         and how freight travels between Sydney and Brisbane.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is transforming the transportation routes all over the country to achieve long-term objectives. However, these projects are not just about travel and delivery. They're also about jobs. They're about industries. They're about improving access to locations.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've heard from the Prime Minister in question time today about small business. Our infrastructure pipeline of investment is going to help many small businesses right across the nation. We've talked today about trade. We know that one in five Australians, to have their job, rely on trade. Making sure we've got the Inland Rail and making sure we've got better access roads through the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative and other road-funding measures is going to improve getting product from farms to ports and therefore to our markets. And, of course, our program supports jobs. The Bruce Highway Upgrade Program will invest $10 billion in that wonderful 1,652-kilometre stretch of road between Brisbane and Cairns. There are 7,200 jobs throughout construction that are being supported and being engaged by this wonderful road project that we are investing in.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm asked about the consequence of not having this sort of investment. It's about jobs. Investments made through the 2019-20 budget—that wonderful blueprint and vision brought down right on this spot on 2 April by the Treasurer—are supporting more than 50,000 direct and indirect jobs. The Inland Rail project is stimulating local economies. As of August this year, there's been more than $33 million in contracts committed to more than 70 local businesses, and not just businesses directly providing ballast and other things for the Inland Rail. The owner of Andrews Auto Electrics in Parkes, Wayne Osbourne, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Even though there's been a downturn because of the drought in the rural sector, we've never been busier. We've put on two new apprentices in the last few months, as well as some more admin support.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's how our $100 billion investment is helping rural and regional Australia and, indeed, helping right across this great nation.
