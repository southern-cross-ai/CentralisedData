        On the morning of today's date in 2009, north-westerly winds in excess of 100 kilometres an hour scoured our state, bringing hot, dry air from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        . The storm helped create the most perfect fire conditions at the end of a long, hot and dry week in the midst of a drought. As I stood in the shed painting a car, stupidly, in 47-degree heat, I was unaware of the disaster unfolding three kilometres away. In

        </a>
        at approximately the same time that we are standing here now talking. The fire burnt through Wandong and reached

        at approximately 3 pm. Strong winds blew the fire towards Humevale and Kinglake at speeds of up to 200 kilometres an hour, with embers causing spot fires 20 to 40 kilometres away. Between 3.30 and 7 pm the fire entered

        In this fire, 119 people died and 232 were hospitalised. The towns of Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Flowerdale and Strathewen were nearly completely razed, while many other towns suffered serious damage. The total area destroyed was half a million kilometresâ€”the size of a small country. The energy that

        </a>
        fire released is equivalent to 1,500 atomic bombs of the size of the one that was dropped on Hiroshima. The most significant fire, the Kinglake fire complex, was named after the merging of the two fires of Kilmore and Murrindindi. The extreme temperatures and wind created convection clouds above the flames, which further fuelled the fire and propelled embers far beyond the fire front.

        By the end of this day, 173 lives were lost and many were to follow, and over 2,000 homes were lost. As we reflect, we give thanks to all the Australians who stood up and supported our communities like never before. We remember, reflect and never forget.
