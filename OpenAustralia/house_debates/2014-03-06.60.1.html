        I rise to acknowledge and celebrate all schools in my electorate which are currently inducting their school leaders for 2014. To be elected as school captain, vice-captain or prefect is a tremendous honour and I congratulate those students who have been elected to such important leadership roles.

        I recently had the opportunity to attend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambton_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Lambton High School
        </a>
        's investiture of prefects on Tuesday, 18 February. This event was especially significant for meâ€”I was returning to Lambton High School, the very place that I was elected school captain, albeit many years ago now. I would like to thank the principal, Martin Rosser, for the invitation to attend and I want to put on record my congratulations to the following student leaders: captains, Stephanie Hough and Develka Gunasekera; vice-captains, Isabel Williams and

        I first had the pleasure of meeting Joseph at the launch of the National Disability Insurance Scheme in Newcastle last year. Joseph is a wheelchair user and, not being one to shy away from sharing his opinion, enjoyed the opportunity of meeting the former Prime Minister to talk about his hopes for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . I have no doubt that Joseph and all the school leaders inducted for 2014 will be strong advocates for their school communities. I look forward to working together with them both now and in the future.
