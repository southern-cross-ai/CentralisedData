        Now that the Minister for Resources and Water and his lot have finally caught up with the rest of Australia on the need to have net zero by 2050, he needs to catch up with the rest of Australia on the need to stop

        -11. He's netted himself a spot back in cabinet. He might be back in cabinet, but the minister is out of step with Australians if he thinks that they want this risky offshore oil and gas drilling off our pristine coastline. We just don't want it, Minister.

        and the member for Wentworth, who all say they are against PEP-11, had the chance to knock it on the head, but they didn't. The government used their numbers to stop parliament even considering the member for Warringah's bill that could have stopped PEP-11 once and for all. On all of these occasions I was pleased to host and be supportive of my community. On two occasions this year I've toured the pristine coastline of Port Stephens with my good friend Frank Future from Imagine Cruises, and Albo came to have a look at what they want to do, too. The Prime Minister hasn't even fronted up. That says it all.
