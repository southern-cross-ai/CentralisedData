       <p>
        Last Friday evening, I joined Adelaide's Indian community at a candlelight vigil dedicated to the life of Prabha Arun Kumar. The vigil was held at the Indian Australian Association of South Australia's premises at Broadview.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prabha was horrifically killed in Sydney on Saturday, 7 March around 9.30 pm whilst walking home from work. Prabha was only 300 metres from her home and, at the time of the attack, she was on the phone to her husband Arun in India.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prabha was scheduled to return to India and reunite with her husband and their nine-year-old daughter in April. Arun's last memory of Prabha will be hearing her pleas for her life and her screams before her murderer killed her.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Indian community in Australia is understandably in shock and in mourning. Adding to the distress is not knowing who ended Prabha's life so tragically or why. Their prayers are that the murderer will be found and brought to justice. They are also pleading with Australian authorities to ensure that community safety is made a government priority so that all Australians can go about their daily life without fear.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the family of Prabha Kumar, I extend my sincere condolences. I say to them: we cannot restore your loss or ease your pain, but Australians around the country share your sorrow.
       </p>
