        Today I want to take the time to draw special attention to the Woodcroft Lake Festival, which is fast becoming a tradition. Every year, around September, locals gather to celebrate what is great in their local suburb. The 12th festival, held on 24 September, was once again a major focal point for residents. If, after 12 years, you are able to draw together locals, businesses and others, you are doing something right, and clearly that is what it is happening at Woodcroft. It was a terrific occasion that brought everyone together. I am proud to continue my support for the festival, which is celebrated with a wide variety of entertainment, market stalls, delicious food and activities. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Woodcroft Lake Festival committee—and, in particular, its President, Lucas Cayanan—on their tireless work that has resulted in a successful celebration once again this year.

        While I am here, I also want to congratulate the Ted Noffs Foundation at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Druitt" rel="nofollow">
         Mt Druitt
        </a>
        , who were successful in their application for a Stronger Communities grant for Chifley. The team, led by Julie Dubuc and Ian 'Esky' Escandor, received $6,000 in dollar-for-dollar funding for the installation of some amenities at their place to provide quality facilities to allow them to better meet the needs of young people attending the Street University. They give young people access to a range of creative workshops. They are doing some great work, and I thank the Ted Noffs Foundation for their continued effort in our great suburb of Mt Druitt.
