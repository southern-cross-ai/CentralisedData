       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Is the Minister aware: (a) that between September 2013 and May 2014, the Toowoomba home of Ms Heather Brown-Pascoe, a nationally renowned campaigner to save prime farm land, has been burgled on three occasions; (b) that Ms Brown-Pascoe was the leading columnist in The Australian, is from a four generation farming family and currently runs Queensland's major horse stud; (c) that during these break-ins, computers, laptops and filing cabinets of both Ms Brown-Pascoe and her husband, containing material relating to government business and political figures, were potentially accessed and that property has been stolen and information purloined; (d) of the fact that an insurance company has paid out for the losses from this break in provide proof that the break in and thefts occurred; (e) that Ms Brown-Pascoe and her husband were advised by their security team that the threat to their safety was real and escalating and arson was possible and under such advice they vacated their home; and (f) that despite considerable evidence, Ms Brown-Pascoe and her husband have hardly heard from the police and in fact no one is aware of any evidence that the police are even carrying out an investigation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Has the Minister had any contact with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Is the Minister aware of any communications on this issue between Queensland Police and either State or Federal Ministers; if so, what was the nature of such contact and any discussions which may have occurred.
