        It gives me great pleasure to speak today in honour of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         Lakes Entrance
        </a>
        Surf Life Saving Club, which has been awarded the 2009
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        club of the year. This is an outstanding achievement for a comparatively small regional club and all credit is due to past and present members. The surf life saving movement across Australia is one of our nation’s most important community service organisations, providing a highly valued rescue service to keep our beaches safe throughout the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my home town of Lakes Entrance, the surf life saving club plays a critical role in the social and economic life of the region.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety_Mile_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Ninety Mile Beach
        </a>
        is prone to rips and large swells and, like all surf beaches, conditions can change quite quickly. Inexperienced swimmers can be caught unawares and it is essential that a patrolled beach is provided for the safety of local residents and also to attract tourists to our town. Tourism is a major industry in Lakes Entrance and I have no doubt that the existence of the surf life saving club and the countless hours of patrols that have been provided over the past 50 years add an enormous amount to the economic wellbeing of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the greatest service provided by the Lakes Entrance club and so many other surf life saving clubs around Australia is the role it plays in helping young people achieve their full potential. I am proud to say that three of my children are enrolled in the Lakes Entrance nippers program. In fact, more than 100 youngsters participated in the Lakes Entrance program over the past summer months. The nippers are trained in first aid and surf safety and also have the benefits of enjoying a healthy and active lifestyle.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of this would be possible without the efforts of outstanding volunteers and parents, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Brown
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
         David Richardson
        </a>
        , who ran the nippers program over the summer months in Lakes Entrance. Similarly, the club’s success as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Club
        </a>
        of the Year would not have been possible without dozens of volunteers over many years of service. The dedication and commitment of so many people has contributed to the club enjoying recognition this year.

        </a>
        like our former club leaders and local citizens of the year, Ian Shepherd, Ron Stott and Doc McKenzie; and the current leadership team of president, Trevor Dix; secretary, Kris Cordery, captain Cameron King; and treasurer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Carroll" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Carroll
        </a>
        . I mention the treasurer last not just because he barracks for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        but because Tony has the job of securing funding for the redevelopment of the clubhouse. The community has done a great job in building new facilities in recent times with volunteer fundraising and the assistance of some government funding, but they are still about $400,000 short of their target to complete the next stage of the project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The existing facilities are very well used and supported by the community not only in terms of their primary use as a surf life saving clubhouse but also as a venue for private functions. However, there is a shortage of storage space and there is a need for improved first aid treatment facilities and, most importantly, the existing building does not provide adequately for people with disabilities or reduced mobility.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will be working with my colleagues at state level to pursue funding opportunities at both the state and the federal level on behalf of Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club because Australia’s best club deserves some of Australia’s best facilities. Without wishing to pre-empt future announcements, the Lakes Entrance club is strongly tipped to host next year’s Victorian junior and state titles. The club did a magnificent job of hosting the 2008 junior titles and is ready, willing and able to do it all again. It would top off the state titles if the new facilities were in place to cater for the thousands of surf lifesavers and their families who will descend on Lakes Entrance for the event.
