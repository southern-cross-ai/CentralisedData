        Students in Longman are fortunate in that they are blessed with both state and federal governments determined to see that they are able to acquire skills necessary for them to participate in building Australia’s future. The Rudd government’s allocation of $1.36 million for the Building Construction Trade Training Centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morayfield_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        has been complemented by the Bligh government’s investment of $1.8 billion to build the College of Civil Infrastructure and Construction at nearby Caboolture State High School. I was pleased to take part in the official opening of the new college on 21 August, joining the state Minister for Education,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Geoff Wilson
        </a>
        , and the member for Pumicestone,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carryn_Sullivan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This is the first training facility built under the Bligh government’s Schools Industry Trade Centres Program and represents the realisation of the vision of the Skills Formation Group for Civil Construction.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate Caboolture State High School and, in particular, school principal Norm Fuller for the realisation of this fantastic diversification project at the school. The steering committee included representatives of the civil construction industry, notably McIlwain Civil and Boral, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay Regional Council
        </a>
        . This collaboration has ensured that young people looking for a career in civil construction will be able to develop their skills working on equipment that has currency within the industry and within a simulated industry space. The Rudd government has contributed to that outcome with a $305,000 grant from the National Training Infrastructure Program. That money has been used to purchase new machinery that forms part of the industry standard remit of the college—machinery such as the mini-excavator and the posi-track ‘bobcat’ proudly displayed during the opening ceremonies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking at the opening and representing the civil construction industry, Keith McIlwain referred to his industry as ‘horizontal builders’ and the ‘creators of sustainable community assets’. This industry requires skilled workers and this is an important opportunity to renew and revitalise that workforce. Through school based apprenticeships or traineeships, a combination of study and work placement in industry, skills in occupations such as bitumen surfacing, bridge building, concrete construction, plant operation, pipe laying and road building will be imparted to students. These skills are indispensable in infrastructure projects. The college will also prepare students aiming for tertiary study in engineering and related fields. Young people transitioning through the college will in essence be fast-tracked on pathways leading to a trade or professional engagement within an industry that is central to nation building. With that comes the satisfaction that their work will have ensured a better standard of living for future generations of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bligh government is to be commended for recognising the role that schools can play in preparing young Queenslanders for the jobs we need in the near future, as infrastructure projects are rolled out across the country, and for its backing for Caboolture State High School. I want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        , for the federal government contribution of $305,000 which has provided for the new machinery that is so important to positive practical outcomes for students.
