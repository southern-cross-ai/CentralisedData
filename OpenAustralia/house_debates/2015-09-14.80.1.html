           I thank the member for Cowan for his question. I know that he, like most members of this House, is a great enthusiast for the international education market and for growing international education because of the jobs and the growth that that brings for our economy. In fact, international education is our fourth largest export industry, after iron ore, coal and natural gas, and it is one in front of gold. I think that most Australians are not aware of just how vitally important education is to our economy and to jobs. In fact, it directly employs about 135,000 Australians and is worth about $18 billion more than $18 billion of value to the Australian economy. Since the election of the Abbott government that value has increased by $2 billion.

             There has been a 14.6 per cent increase in international education enrolments in the last two years because of the policies that this government has introduced with the support of the states and with the support of the sector. Therefore, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement represents a new opportunity for international education providers in Australia, particularly in a seat like Canning. Canning has a large number of industries, from bauxite and gold mining right across to tourism. Also little known is its education institutions, its education assets, such as the Peel campus of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdoch_University" rel="nofollow">
              Murdoch University
             </a>
             and the Polytechnic's Armadale campus, which was formally the Armadale campus of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtin_University" rel="nofollow">
              Curtin University
             </a>
             . These institutions will benefit from the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement because on the day that the free trade agreement is finalised 77 new providers will immediately become approved providers on the Chinese government's official website, opening more serveries to international students who wish to come to Australia, giving Australian institutions more opportunities to have joint ventures in China and arrangements with China that expand their operations here and there, and vice versa. There are great opportunities. For example, there are 28 non-

             s, registered training organisations, in Canning that will benefit and have the opportunity to get on that list of approved providers and therefore increase their revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
             These things will happen if the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement goes ahead. They are vital for changing the economy in

             and elsewhere to an economy that draws on many different sources and is therefore flexible and agile in a changing world economic environment. Who could not be in favour of this China-Australia Free Trade Agreement? Sadly, the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition, the
