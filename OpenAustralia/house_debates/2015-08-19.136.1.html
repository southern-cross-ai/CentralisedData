        Mr Speaker, this is my first speech before you. I congratulate you on your new role.

        It is time to see the benefit and not the burden. There are over 30,000 people who have been on visas that have been prohibited from working—a legacy of the Labor era. Many of those 30,000 people are living in regional Australia. Our government has created Safe Haven Enterprise Visas. A Safe Haven Enterprise Visa requires 3½ out of five years of work or study in a regional area in order to be able to apply for and eventually obtain residency. The Safe Haven Enterprise Visa creates hope for desperate people. State governments are required to sign on to Safe Haven Enterprise Visas to activate the program. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        state government is the only state government at this stage to have signed on to Safe Haven Enterprise Visas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Victorian Labor Andrews government, whilst giving in-principle support, is playing with people's lives just to get a few crumbs from the federal government Treasury. They are saying that they do not want to sign off on the visas unless there are some more federal resources going towards refugee support in regional areas. My area is appalled by that. How low can the Andrews government go? They are stooping to using refugees—desperate people who want to work—as ransom to try and extract some more federal government funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        I love the people in my electorate. They are very fair-minded people. I have letters here from the communities of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Nhill, Mildura, Horsham and Stawell pleading with the Andrews government to get on with it and sign on to Safe Haven Enterprise Visas.
       </p>
       <p>
        We recognise that there is no such thing as perfect policy when you are dealing with refugees and when you are dealing with desperate people. But the people of regional Australia, the people that I represent—and others right across Australia—can see that these refugees are a blessing. They are not a burden and should not be seen as such. And they should not be used as a ransom tool by the Victorian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need workers to grow our horticultural industry. We need workers to grow our animal husbandry industry and our abattoir expansions. The opportunities that we have stitched up with free trade agreements will only be capitalised if we can turn those opportunities into reality with hands and feet on the ground—with workers. The cruelty and tardiness of the Victorian Labor government is in contrast to the compassion and optimism of the people of the Wimmera, Mallee and Mildura regions. A recent Deloitte report stated that Karen refugees who live in Nhill, in my community, have contributed and driven an additional $40 million into the economy. These people are a benefit. They are not a burden. It appals me that the Victorian government has not signed on to Safe Haven Enterprise Visas.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is time, if I can use that great Labor phrase, for the Victorian government to do the right thing. Go and meet with these people. They care about Australia. They came here and they want to make their home here. They want a pathway to being here forever. They want to contribute to their society. We have jobs for them. We have a community that cares for them. We have the legislation that has been through this House and through the Senate, and all we need is the Victorian Labor government to stop being so damned cruel. There is just no excuse for their behaviour. All they are trying to do is ratchet a few extra crumbs, and they are playing with people's lives and opportunities. People are beginning to see that you cannot behave like this and call yourself compassionate. I simply say to the Victorian Labor government: it is time. Give these people a go. Let them work. There is work for them. They are a benefit to our regional communities and not a burden. Get on with it!
