        I'd like to take this opportunity to recognise the stellar contribution made by well-known

        . He was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        of the Bushland Health Group, and he has retired after 43 years of service. Denis has overseen a massive transformation in the Bushland Health Group, a community not-for-profit organisation that delivers a broad range of services, including aged care, home care, disability care and retirement living. Denis began his career with the main roads department in 1969. Ten years later, he then went on to complete his uni studies in health administration, working in the public hospital system as an administrator, before moving back to Taree to take up an administrator role with the new Bushland Health Group, which was known as Manning Valley Senior Citizens Homes back in 1979.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working with the board of directors, Denis has shown outstanding leadership. When you look at what he has accomplished in his time as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , it's second to none. From that small group, they went on to run a private hospital for a long while, but they've also developed residential aged-care facilities at Banyula Lodge, Alkira Lodge and Karingal Gardens and retirement living facilities at Jacaranda Avenue, Jarrah Place, Warrana Place, Parklands and Bushland Place. I am very proud to say they are also at the forefront of delivering a massive project on the banks of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_River" rel="nofollow">
         Manning River
        </a>
        . As the federal member, I worked with them to get a federal government grant to support the headworks—like roads, traffic lights and sewerage—for the Figtrees on the Manning project, which Bushland Health Group is delivering. It will enable subsequent further sites for Bushland Health Group to deliver retirement living complexes. It's just down the road from the Karingal Gardens residential aged-care facility. The absolute economic boost to the Manning Valley will be huge because, following them, other owners of land in that area will invest up to $500 million—that's in 2011 dollars, when this was first proposed—for more residential and commercial development in that space.
       </p>
       <p>
        Denis, from all of us who know the work you've done in the Manning Valley for residential aged care and for general support of the community: what a fantastic career. Well done. We all salute you and your family. Enjoy your retirement.
