        This month marks a significant milestone for many of the community organisations in my electorate of Stirling, many of whom are doing incredible work and have been active within our community for decades. To have withstood the test of time and multiple challenges that come with it—in particular, COVID-19—is a significant achievement in itself. But to serve the community and deliver positive outcomes to local communities and families is absolutely admirable.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few weeks ago I attended Majella Catholic Primary School to join them in their 50th-year celebratory mass. It was really heartening to speak with the students, as well as the teachers past and present, at this momentous milestone and to see just how passionate and dedicated the staff, the priests and other assistants throughout the school are to their community. On a tour of the school later that day with Principal David Barns I had the opportunity to see some of the infrastructure and facilities that the Morrison government has supported the construction of and to hear about the school's vision for the future. Well done to David and the Majella team for the hard work and dedication that you put in to make the community a real hub, particularly for the multicultural students and families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later that same day I was just down the road at Nollamara, where I joined Uniting Aid who were celebrating their 40th anniversary—not quite at the 50 years of Majella, but they're catching up. I would like to acknowledge Uniting Aid and their team of dedicated individuals for their continued service to the disadvantaged people living in my electorate of Stirling. This amazing organisation has provided support and emergency relief to those in need, including food, clothing, household goods and financial assistance with utility bills. In particular, in recognising the volunteers, I recognise a couple of the very special volunteers, Charis Page and Wendy Gardner. At the 40th anniversary celebrations it really was an honour to recognise Wendy and Charis and pay tribute to their hard work over many, many years.

        This weekend, Hamersley Scout group will celebrate their 50th anniversary with a community open day. I'd like to commend this organisation for their fantastic work in providing young boys and girls with the skills that they need as they emerge as our future leaders. It's local groups, organisations and schools like these in Stirling that are the lifeblood of our communities, providing wonderful opportunities and support to their neighbours, to those in need and to the next generation of young Australians.
