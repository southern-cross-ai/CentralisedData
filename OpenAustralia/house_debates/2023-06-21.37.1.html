       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge and celebrate Refugee Week. For decades now Australia has offered a home to those who've lost theirs because of wars, because of disasters and because of atrocities. It is a proud legacy, one which defines us and one which is reflected in this year's theme of 'finding freedom'. This legacy has been tarnished more recently by those who've sought to exploit and politicise our refugee programs, but the essential humanity and generosity of Australians remains. I see it every day in my community in Wentworth, as I'm sure MPs from around the country see it in their communities. I see it in our community support for refugees like Said Imasi, who was held in detention for more than 13 years before being released earlier this year.

        There's still work to be done to ensure our country's policies genuinely reflect the values of our communities and our principles, but we're making progress, though it is often difficult and hard fought. I would like to thank those who make that effort for progress, particularly my predecessor,
