       <p>
        A valuable link to Mackay's pioneering past was lost this month with the sad passing of Gloria Arrow, a faithful and steadfast protector and promoter of a bygone era through her 60 year tenure with the historical Greenmount Homestead. Gloria arrived at the home of the pioneering Cook family in 1958, when she was just 17 years old, to take up the role of live-in housemaid. She became so much more than that over the years: more daughter, friend, confidant and carer to Tom and Dorothy Cook as well as Dorothy's mother, Hannah, in her final years. This did not diminish in any way Gloria's connection with her true family, the extended Arrow and Choppy families of Homebush and Mackay, who are now morning the passing of their Aunty Gloria.
       </p>
       <p>
        So strong was the connection to the Cooks and the graceful old Greenmount Homestead that, when the property was bequeathed to the district, provision was made for Gloria to stay on at that home for as long as she chose. For many years Gloria welcomed the region's schoolchildren and visitors from far and wide to give them an insight into life at the historical Greenmount, only departing in 2019 to move into a nursing home as her needs were at that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many books, articles, sketches and photos have told the story of Greenmount through the eyes of Gloria Arrow. We are forever grateful for her special place in the history of the Mackay region.
