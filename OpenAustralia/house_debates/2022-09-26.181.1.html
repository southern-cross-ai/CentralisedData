       <p>
        I rise in this place just over 79 years to the day that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enid_Lyons" rel="nofollow">
         Enid Lyons
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Tangney" rel="nofollow">
         Dorothy Tangney
        </a>
        entered through the doors of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        . I note the member for Tangney in the chamber today. These were two incredible womenâ€”Enid Lyons was the first woman elected to this place, and Dorothy Tangney was the first woman elected to the other place. I am speaking today in honour of another trailblazing woman,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Helen_Spence" rel="nofollow">
         Catherine Helen Spence
        </a>
        . Like Dorothy Tangney and Enid Lyons, Catherine Helen Spence has the auspicious honour of having one of the 151 electorates named after her, namely the division of Spence, which I have the privilege to represent in this place.

        Born in Scotland 1825, she moved to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 1839 with her family. She was a governess, a novelist and an advocate of the suffrage movement. Her first passion was that of writing, with her novel
        <i>
         Clara Morison
        </i>
        the first novel set in Australia that was written by a woman.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was a considerable advocate for women's education, playing a vital role in the establishment of the Advanced School for Girls in 1870. This school was at the time the only public academic school preparing women for entrance to the

        . Later, she served as vice-president of the Women's Suffrage League from 1891 to 1894, the year that the
