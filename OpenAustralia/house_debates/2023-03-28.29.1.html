        Our youth are our future. One of my favourite parts of this job is that I regularly get to visit the fantastic schools and childcare centres across my electorate. I'm always impressed to see young people showing interest in how parliament works, and I love meeting our up-and-coming leaders. A couple of weeks ago it was question time at Queens Beach State School in Bowen, with year 5s. The little ladies and gents didn't hold back firing questions at me.

        Some were, 'Mr Wilcox, why did you want to be the federal member for Dawson?' I said that I had a genuine desire to help people and that I want to make our region, and Australia, a better place. 'How did you get your job?' I said I was elected by a democratic vote, that the people of Dawson knew that I would work hard and so I won the position at the 2022 election. 'Mr Wilcox, how much you get paid?' I told them that I get paid a lot, which is why it is important to vote for somebody you believe in, who is a hard worker and who will be a strong voice for you in Canberra. 'Mr Willcox, what's it like in Canberra?' 'Well, it's cold most of the time, and I miss the warm, sunny days we're so lucky to have here in Dawson. It's very busy. I start early in the morning and I finish late at night. But there is always something going on.' I think it's safe to say that the future of Dawson and our nation is in safe hands with these little legends coming through. Thank you,
