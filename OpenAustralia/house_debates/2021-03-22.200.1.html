        To everyone: happy National Local Day. As much as I like being here, I'd much rather be celebrating this special occasion in the very place that it asks us all to celebrate, which is in our local pubs back in the electorate. This day, one year ago, 23 March, was a dark day in our history, particularly for our local pubs. It was the day that their taps were turned off and their doors were closed, something we couldn't have imagined. It would be easy to make a joke about a pub with no beer if it hadn't been so serious for the lives and livelihoods of those who were impacted. In particular, the uncertainty was hard to bear. But local pubs and clubs and businesses did their very best. They adapted as best they could and, importantly, they have shown a remarkable comeback, along with the whole Australian economy. So this year, to mark the anniversary and the resilience of our great local pubs and small businesses and clubs, the National Local Day campaign aims to get everybody to have a beer at their local pub to support these jobs and these businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many things that we can do to support campaigns in this place, and I'm sure this is one we can all get behind without partisanship or politics to support these small business people. To all the residents of Ryan: I implore you, tonight, whether you're swinging by the Suburban Social in

        , the Blind Tiger in The Gap or any of the many fantastic local joints that we have, stop in, have a beer and support those businesses and those jobs.
