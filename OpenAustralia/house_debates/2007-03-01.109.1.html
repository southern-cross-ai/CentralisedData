       <p>
        I hasten to mention that this story is not about frogs; it was triggered by dead owls and fat snakes. I would like to commend the work done by the macadamia growers and community organisations of Bundaberg who have joined forces to find an environmentally sensitive solution to a problem in local macadamia orchards. The nub of the project is the installation of five prototype nesting boxes along Splitters Creek, a tributary of the Burnett river, in a naturally wooded area adjacent to a number of macadamia plantations owned by Hinkler Park. The boxes are designed for rehabilitated owls, which will then become territorial and go on to control the rat population within the plantations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Wednesday, 21 February, I was asked to release the very first owl into a plantation but, sadly, tragedy struck just hours before the event. Although these owls had been brought in as a natural predator for rats, a predator of the owl got in first; the owl that I was due to release was eaten by a carpet snake which got into its enclosure. It was the second owl to be taken in such a manner. Ben Ralph, of Readymix Concrete in Bundaberg, came to the rescue and offered to donate a concrete slab, which would be built underneath the enclosure to ensure the safety of future owls. Growers and business organisations also assisted with enhancements. Hinkler Park macadamia manager, Adrian Van Boven, offered financial assistance to extend the enclosure with netting and mesh. In the meantime, local macadamia growers will continue to encourage owls to take up residency in the newly constructed owl boxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many people who have been pivotal to this project from the start—in particular, the project coordinator of the Australian Macadamia Society, Growcom’s Development Officer, Patrick Logue, along with Bundaberg wildlife carer

        , who originally nursed the damaged owls back to health. David is also the workshop supervisor of the

       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the work of these people. It is innovative and I hope to hear of even greater successes with this project, not just in Bundaberg but across Australia where there are owl populations—for example, in your area in northern

        , Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. This project is truly an integrated pest management adventure being taken to another level. I commend the people involved.
