       <p>
        At the start of April I had the absolute pleasure of dropping by Haynes Farm to meet with Haynes and Ethan. Haynes is an 18-year-old Hunter local who has just opened his own farm. Opening a farm at the age of just 18 is an extraordinary achievement for anyone, but Haynes is even more amazing than your average 18-year-old. Haynes lives with autism, but he doesn't let this hold him back at all. He always had a dream of owning his own farm, and now he does.
       </p>

        The boys showed me around the farm. They showed me their chicken coop, the jetty, the orchard, and they showed me their plans to expand. Thank you so much for a great morning. I even got to take home my own carton of farm-fresh eggs to have for breakfast, and let me say, Mr Speaker, they were delicious. Thanks also to Maxine, who runs Strive for Autism, which is a local group of friends and families supporting others coping with autism.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you need something to brighten up your day, go and visit Haynes farm. They've recently planted a crop of veggies, so get in and support this great local bloke and pick up some farm-fresh eggs and fresh produce. I look forward to learning more and visiting the farm again, Haynes. Enjoy it, and good luck.
