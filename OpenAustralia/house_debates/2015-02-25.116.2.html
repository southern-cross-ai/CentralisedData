        I would like to acknowledge the heroism of two young men from Coogee in our community. On Sunday, 22 February, James and Josh Beard, like so many others from our area, were enjoying a game of golf. They were on the 10th tee of The Coast Golf Club in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        with their father, Malcom, when the 18-year-old and 21-year-old heard a desperate cry for help coming from the ocean below. Instantly the pair tore down the hill, threw off their clothes, emptied their pockets and dove in, quickly reaching the distressed spearfisherman, who had become panicked after being caught in a powerful rip. The pair dragged him back to shore safely. So cool were the boys that, after the episode, they put their shirts back on, caught up with the group and only missed one hole. An incredible act of selflessness by any means, made even more astonishing by the fact Josh was in recovery after a knee reconstruction just four weeks earlier.

        after the episode, James said that, while eager to get on with the game, he first had to dive back in to rescue his dad's scorecard. His father went on to record an outstanding score, perhaps inspired by his sons' great efforts. An incredible act of bravery by any means, the rescue serves to highlight the dangers associated with fishing or swimming in coastal regions.

        is a renowned treacherous stretch of ocean, with treacherous beach conditions and big wave surfing and with rock-fishing black spots dotted along the coast. Between 2004 and 2012, according to Surf Life Saving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        , there were 15 rock-fishing deaths along the Kingsford Smith coast. In 2011, our area represented one-third of all rock-fishing fatalities in New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout my time in this place, I have sought to raise awareness of the risks inherent in coastal activities, particularly when those involved are ill-prepared for the conditions and ignore the safety precautions. Unfortunately, rock fishermen remain notoriously lax when it comes to wearing the proper safety gear, including protective and non-slip footwear and, most importantly, a life vest. While many Australians are well aware of the importance of swimming where it is safe, many continue to risk their lives by swimming outside the red and yellow flags on our beaches. I implore those planning to visit Australia's coast to stay safe, to listen to the experts and to take proper precautions. And once again, I pay tribute to young James and Josh Beard for their outstanding act of heroism.
