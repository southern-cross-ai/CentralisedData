        I rise to present a Raise Our Voice speech on behalf of a constituent. It reads:

        Respect for women, this is the change I want to see to better future generations of young women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On average one woman a week is murdered due to male violence towards women. This year we have devastatingly lost 56 women to gendered violence. 56 women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Why is this violence so normalised, where does it stem from? Could it be a lack of respect for women, which in turn creates a culture whereby gendered violence is normalised as women are seen as less than?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Well, if respect is one piece of this violent puzzle the question, I want to post to you all here today is, are women being respected in parliament?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And if they are not being respected, what sort of precedent is that setting for our country?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If women are torn down, excluded, ridiculed, called names and told that their experiences are invalid in a place that is meant to govern and protect us, what sort of message are we sending?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That these gendered atrocities are somehow, okay? What behaviours are we unconsciously normalising?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Respect for women, respect for women in parliament and in every facet of life, this is the change I want to see to better the future generations of young women.

         This year I'm excited to announce that we had 56 submissions from my community of Fowler in the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign. According to the Raise Our Voice Australia team, it was one of the most successful outreaches.

         This is the winning speech from Matt Keo of Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School Cabramatta:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Ms Le, My name is Matt Keo, I am of the age of 11 and am part of the Fowler electorate. I would like to express my concern about the issue of property prices in Sydney. Property value in Sydney is among one of the most expensive in the world as well as being the least affordable.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia's housing prices has been a major issue for quite a while. This could result in the housing market and economy in Australia crumbling. Causes of this could be things such as population, material shortages and more. Some of these can't be prevented, but some can. Home building has been quite a problem for a while, increased home building would over time result in housing prices being more affordable. Other ways this can be solved is investing in the housing market. Yes, this would cost a fortune, however the economic market would fall without it.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In conclusion, housing prices are a major problem that could cause the fall of the economic market and should be a major concern. Ways to fix this problem are increased home building and investment in the housing market. This could save Australia from an economic disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'd like to thank Matt Keo for this speech.
