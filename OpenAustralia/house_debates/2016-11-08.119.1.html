        I am pleased today to provide a positive update on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        roll out in Bonner. Under the coalition's rollout plan, thousands of people are being connected to the NBN each month. More people can access the NBN every month than Labor managed to connect in their entire time in office. The NBN has hit every rollout target the coalition has set since coming to government; this includes Bonner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction of the coalition's NBN using a multi-mix technology is now under way in two of the five exchanges in Bonner. Right now, 1,100 premises in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Mile_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Eight Mile Plains
        </a>
        are connected to fibre-to-the-node. By Christmas it is expected construction will begin to around 14,000 premises in the area. Work is planned to progress south of Eight Mile Plains over the next few months. It is also expected to extend west of Capalaba with NBN construction expected to begin in Chandler, Ransome and Gumdale before the end of the year. I have fought hard to bring the NBN to Bonner and now it is well on its way.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also good news for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gravatt" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gravatt
        </a>
        region. NBN network construction is planned to start in the Mount Gravatt area in the first half of 2017, mainly in the areas of upper Mount Gravatt stretching towards Mackenzie. I am thrilled for the locals in these areas who have been sharing with me for years their frustrations with their internet connection. Over the past few years I have lobbied the then minister for communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , regarding the slow internet speeds for my local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Living locally, I know how frustrating slow internet speeds can be. That is why I have been fighting tirelessly to get Bonner on the NBN rollout maps sooner. I have been committed to ensuring that my residents have access to fast and affordable broadband sooner. The coalition is taking a fully transparent approach so that the public will have a clear and accurate idea of when they will receive fast broadband.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vast majority of residents and businesses in Bonner will have access to the NBN in the next few years. Today nearly two-thirds of all premises are in design, under construction or ready for service. This is a remarkable achievement and I thank my colleagues, especially

        , the Minister for Communications, and the NBN for working so hard to make this a reality.
