        My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, and I refer to his previous answer. Right up until today,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        s have been advising patients they require a 14-day gap between COVID and flu shots. Only this morning, the aged care minister cited that 14-day gap as the reason for the slow COVID vaccine rollout in aged-care facilities. Minister, when did the

         I happen to have with me the

          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         's letter. I will have a copy sent down to the chamber and I will table it. That has come about precisely because of the circumstances in Victoria. It is advice, as we always do, where we respond to the circumstances of the day. I will, with the grace of the House, read the relevant parts of the letter from the Chief Medical Officer. Yes, it is a response to the Victorian outbreak and, therefore, the ability to ensure that everybody is vaccinated. The letter states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Dear colleagues
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Administration of seasonal influenza and COVID 19 vaccines
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Thank you for your continued efforts to ensure our most vulnerable populations are protected…
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … … …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         You may be aware, that the co-administration of a seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccine on the same day is not routinely recommended. This advice, generated by our independent medical experts, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) was first developed on what was an absence of data on the safety and effectiveness of those vaccines being administered on the same day.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … … …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am writing to today to advise that I have consulted with members of ATAGI and can assure you that given the evolving COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Victoria, it is my strong recommendation that residents and staff in residential aged care settings be vaccinated as quickly as possible against COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In order to do this, it will mean that there is a shortened interval of time placed between the administrations of the seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccine. It is important to note that this will not have an impact on the effectiveness of the two vaccines, but rather ensure that our most vulnerable are protected at a time when COVID-19 is circulating with more readily within the community.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Thank you once again for your continued efforts to combat COVID-19.
        </p>

         Yours sincerely,
