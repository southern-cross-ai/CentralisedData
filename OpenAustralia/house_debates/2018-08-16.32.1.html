       <p>
        This government is deeply committed to providing a safer online environment for all Australians. The government has a duty to ensure that, with ever evolving technology and expanding communications methods, the Commonwealth laws provide a deterrent and sound basis for prosecuting offenders who would do Australians harm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Combating the non-consensual sharing of intimate images requires a national approach across education, victim support, civil avenues and law enforcement agencies. To that end, the government introduced civil penalties for intimate image abuse in the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill. This bill will create a civil penalty regime that will give victims a timely, accessible and effective means of redress to remove intimate images shared maliciously through a carriage service.
       </p>
       <p>
        This new civil prohibition regime will address the primary concern of victims, which is a legislative system that facilitates the rapid removal of images without having to rely on the criminal justice system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has now moved this amendment to the bill to introduce new offences that will create higher criminal penalties for the online distribution of intimate images, complementing the civil prohibition and penalty regime proposed in the bill. This amendment sends a clear message: this behaviour will not be tolerated. Where private sexual material is criminally distributed online, significantly higher penalties will apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has a demonstrated history of protecting Australians online through enacting legislation creating the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, who champions the safety of all Australians online. This bill and this amendment represent a further step to protecting Australians online. It is important that the criminal justice system provides appropriate redress for more serious forms of image based abuse, such as perpetrators continuing to share intimate images after multiple civil penalty orders have been made. Repeated image based abuse is a significantly more serious and malicious form of online harassment that deeply affects a person's right to privacy and self-integrity, warranting a significantly higher criminal penalty.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment creates two new aggravated offences for the Commonwealth offence of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence, which has been successfully used to prosecute image based abuse. The aggravated offences will apply higher penalties in two circumstances—firstly, where the use of the carriage service involves dealings in private sexual material and, secondly, where the use of the carriage service involves dealings in private sexual material and three or more civil penalty orders have been made under the civil penalty regime established by the bill. The current offence for using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence has a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment. This amendment will increase the maximum penalty to five years imprisonment for dealings in private sexual material and seven years imprisonment for repeat offenders of the civil penalty regime. The amendment also inserts a definition of 'private sexual material' and ensures that consent is taken into account when considering whether the use of a carriage service to distribute private sexual material is offensive.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill and the amendment I have moved will ensure Australians have greater protections from online image based abuse and will serve as a significant deterrent to those who would exploit a person's trust and privacy in such a malicious fashion.
