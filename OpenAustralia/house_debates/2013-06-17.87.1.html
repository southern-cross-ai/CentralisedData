         I thank the member for her question. Indeed, just last week, together we announced more than half a billion dollars for the necessary preconstruction work on the Woolgoolga to Ballina section of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Highway
         </a>
         —just a part of our record $7.9 billion that we have committed. This section of preconstruction is fifty-fifty funded between the Commonwealth and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also getting on with the job of upgrading the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         , and last Wednesday I was also in Queensland. I was there to begin construction on section A of Cooroy to Curra, a vital project—$790 million shared between the Commonwealth and the state government. The Leader of the Opposition asks his deputy, the Leader of the Nationals, whether he was there. No, he was not. He did not turn up to the sod-turn at the beginning of construction, just as he did not turn up at the announcement of funding, the beginning of construction, the completing of construction or the opening of section B in his electorate. So I thought: 'Fair enough. He's probably been pretty busy working on policy.' I saw a bit of policy from those opposite on 14 June—last week. The
         <i>
          South Coast Register
         </i>
         had the headline 'Abbott show rolls into town'. It says—this is a direct quote:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If we are elected we will form an organisation called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         …
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, there's a thought! There's an idea! Why didn't we think of that? Then he went on to say this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … which will do its best to rationally and scientifically look at the various infrastructure projects and rank the best on public cost benefit …
        </p>
        <p>
         There's another idea! Why didn't we think of that? Melbourne Metro—we did it. It is on the list. Cross River Rail—it is on the list. All 15 out of 15 projects are on the list, and we are funding them, and this bloke is telling state governments: 'No, don't accept the money. Stick with the Bombay solution on Cross River Rail of removing seats so people can stand up.'

          Madam Speaker, on a point of order: before the Leader of the House blows a gasket, I will slow him down. But, to be relevant, surely he needs to explain whether the

That is precisely what we have done. It is precisely the good policy structure that we have set up. This bloke has not noticed that we have been funding public transport in our capital cities and urban centres. He also has not noticed Infrastructure Australia; so, to help him, I table the national infrastructure priority list, which has on it the

              I thank the member for that very good supplementary question. Indeed, it gives me the opportunity to talk about the national infrastructure priority list. Those opposite raise issues of what the priorities should be and raise in interjections the

               NBN
              </a>
              . Here is the list of Australia's national infrastructure priorities. What is No. 1? A national broadband network. It is dated May 2009. It was part of our budget proposals, but those opposite do not pay any attention to details, even when it is the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">

              , where the member for Cowper did not bother to turn up to the Kempsey bypass opening—remember that: $613 million of Commonwealth money, not one cent of state government money, and not one cent from the Nats when they were in government. They saved it all for the ad, trying to take credit. The Leader of the Nationals described the Cooroy-to-Curra section that we are funding and for which construction of the next section started last Wednesday as 'the worst road in Australia'. The worst road in Australia is in his electorate, and he did nothing about it.

                Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing orders, in terms of the time limits for debates et cetera, question time is supposed to finish at 3.10 or after 20 questions have been asked. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was on her feet before 3.10, and 20 questions have not been asked, so on what basis is the Prime Minister cutting off question time?
