        Unfortunately, I have bad news for my community today. Woolworths have withdrawn Norco milk from over 90 of its Sydney stores. Sydney is the biggest milk market in Australia, and this is terrible news for Australia's largest owned dairy co-op.

Woolworths were represented at the reopening of the ice cream factory in Lismore a few months ago. I get that Woolworths does not support Australia Day, I get that they were happy to pump money into a pro-Voice referendum—
