        Earlier this month, I visited Koala Publishingâ€”successful producers of quality greeting cards in my electorate of Dobell. I would like to thank Reuben Machin and Julie-Anne Goodman for taking the time to show me around. This year, Koala Publishing were awarded the Business of the Year Award as well as Employer of Choice at the Central Coast Business Excellence Awards. After meeting with both Reuben and Julie-Anne, it was evident why this business is recognised as an employer of choice. Whether it is the installation of a new gym, changing the vending machine to healthy products or any number of other initiatives, Koala Publishing takes care of its employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of commenting on their success, I would also like to congratulate and thank Koala Publishing for being 100 per cent locally owned and operated. Koala's product ranges are designed in Australia by award winning designers and the cards and wrap are also produced in Australia, further supporting Australian jobs. When I met with general manager, Reuben Machin, I was impressed by his personal commitment to the local economy. As Reuben's states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supporting local jobs in a struggling region has always been a passion.
       </p>
       <p>
        And for this he should be commended. I congratulate Koala Publishing for their commitment to a variety of charities, a number of which are supported due to personal circumstances of staff members. The following quote from Reuben highlights the emphasis placed on employee wellbeing at Koala Publishing. The quote reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regardless of your type of business, and the products or services you sell, if you don't believe in your people, then you don't believe in your business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Koala Publishing.
