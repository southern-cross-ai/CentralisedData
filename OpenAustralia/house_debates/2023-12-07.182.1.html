       <p>
        I wanted to take the opportunity before the House adjourns to place on the record the deep concern within my community—a deep concern which I share—for the ongoing conflict and loss of human life in Gaza. We all know that there is a long, complex and disputed history to this conflict. The present outbreak of war that is unfolding is creating unfathomable trauma and humanitarian disaster which is reverberating deeply through my community and through other communities around the country and right throughout the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        What happened in October this year was horrific—absolutely horrific and despicable. There's no excuse for what Hamas did. The killing of innocent people is never justified. The taking of hostages is never justified. While we've affirmed Israel's right to defend itself unequivocally, we have consistently emphasised that the way it defends itself absolutely matters. This includes ensuring the protection of hospitals, medical staff, patients, journalists, civilians, aid workers—hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of whom have lost their life in this horrific conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia continues to call for the protection of civilian life in Gaza. Women, children, civilians are not guilty or culpable for the horrific crimes of Hamas and should not be punished for those horrific crimes. There has been too much death and too many innocent lives lost on both sides, and the need for a just and enduring solution, a just and enduring peace between Israelis and the Palestinians, must be realised. I've supported this cause from my first year in this place and well before that. To realise that enduring peace, hostages must obviously be released.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand this is a distressing time for many in my community and for many Australians. I've sought opportunities to communicate my thoughts and the views of the government directly to community leaders. Because of my duties here, I have not been able to attend every event that I would have liked to, but I want to reiterate my deeply felt concern of people within my community, concerns that I share.
       </p>
       <p>
        I come from a region that has got a strong multicultural community. We've lived together not just in harmony but with a deep understanding and mutual respect for each other's faiths and cultural backgrounds. I'm proud of the fact that multifaith communities, such as the Illawarra People for Peace, have come together from time to time over the years to stand up strong against attempts from within the community and beyond to divide us. It is one of the strengths of our community. We must not let this community divide us as well. We must maintain a respect for one another during this time. Hatred and violence are never the answer. We can't bomb our way to peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm aware of calls for the end to the war. I wholeheartedly support and add my voice to this. Peace must prevail in the region through a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians live securely and peacefully within internationally recognised borders. There is no long-term solution to the hostility in the

        </a>
        unless these things are realised.
       </p>
       <p>
        I respond to calls for Australia to do more in the humanitarian effort by pointing out that we are providing over $25 million in humanitarian assistance through trusted partners. This is meaningful and necessary. But what is more meaningful and necessary is an end to the hostilities and a negotiation for an enduring peace in the region—two states, Israelis and Palestinians living in peace side by side.
