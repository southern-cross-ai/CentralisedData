         The Order
        </a>
        of Australia Award is an opportunity for us to pause and reflect on some of the people who make our country so great. Over 30,000 people have received awards since 1975 and no doubt most of them would have performed their community endeavours without seeking this recognition or any celebration of their efforts. But when the times seem so focused on the challenges and the many issues around the world, I think it really is important that the rest of Australia knows more about their extraordinary contributions. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some examples of some of the recipients who live and work in my electorate of Brisbane.

         Colleagues, we could do a lot more. There are so many people in our community who are doing great work, and our whole community can benefit by recognising, acknowledging and thanking ordinary people in our community who do extraordinary work. With

         </a>
         approaching on 8 March, I make a special call-out to the work of Honour A Woman—I'm an honorary ambassador of theirs—for the work they are doing to bring gender balance into these awards. Their call-out is to have fifty-fifty by 2020. Why do we need this? Because in the 2016-17 honours, in the Companion of Australia category there were six women and 20 men. In the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Officer of the Order of Australia
         </a>
         category there were 31 women and 96 men. In the medal category there were 102 women and 231 men. In the OAM category there were 128 women and 592 men. Clearly it's not because men are more deserving; it's because women are not being nominated.
        </p>
        <p>
         What can we do about this? There are a few things the government could do. It could make sure that we've got fifty-fifty representation on the Council for the Order of Australia. We could speed up the application process. Currently it takes 18 to 24 months—two years—between when you put a nomination in and when you get the return. Many people, I know, have not quite lasted those two years. So we need to get more staff in and turn it around quicker. We really need to set gender targets for each of those levels so that those numbers I read out end today and so that we've got some sort of balance between men and women. We need a program coming out of the Governor-General's office to really promote and celebrate our awardees. I know there is much we could do in our community by having workshops and getting people together where we fill in the forms and talk about what makes for a good nominee. The Honour A Woman organisation has set up a Facebook page and they've got over 1,000 followers. I really encourage my friends from my electorate who are in the gallery today: please think about someone you could nominate. It's probably going to be your mother, your aunt, your sister, your cousin or your neighbours. It's really easy. You need to put in the form, find four referees and make a really compelling argument for why this person should be recognised.
        </p>
        <p>
         Truly it is time for the government now to support the work of our community and for the Governor-General's office to step in and do the work that our reports have recommended. We've had two major reviews:
         <i>
          A matter of honour
         </i>
         in 1995 and
         <i>
          The Australian Honours and Awards Branch Report 2012-16
         </i>
         . They had really clear and strong recommendations of what we need to do to get better gender balance, better ethnic balance and much better diversity in these awards. Congratulations to all the people in Indi. I'm really pleased to work with you to make sure we get fifty-fifty by 2020.

          </a>
          for his service to education in the Catholic school system as a leader, administrator, advocate and teacher. I've known Greg for many years, and it seems he's been an educator forever. He spent four years at the Rosemeadow School in the late 1980s as the head of English and history before taking on a raft of high-level roles in the Catholic education sector, including as director of schools at the Catholic Education Office in Wollongong and commissioner of the

         </p>
         <p>
          Greg's contribution to Catholic education is astonishing and it was recognised in 2017 when he was named New South Wales educator of the year. Greg's continued work in education is about best practice and early innovation. He saw how technology could bring the Catholic school system together and in 1991 began linking Catholic schools through a small, private network which now hosts 1,000 schools. Greg has been recognised with a Papal knighthood in the order of

          in its annual Smart 100 awards in 2017. In the same year he was awarded the Sir Harold Wyndham Medal for his contribution to the education of young people in New South Wales. Greg is just one of the many deserving Order of Australia recipients who live and work in and around the Parramatta electorate, but the Catholic education system in our area would not be the same without him.

          <p>
           I welcome the motion before the chamber this evening. I begin by associating myself with the comments of my neighbour, the member for Indi—in particular, her references to the Honour A Woman campaign. There is no question whatsoever that, particularly in our regional communities, that we need to become more activist in our approach to nominating women for senior roles in the community, but also for awards such as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Day
           </a>
           Honours List. I was impressed by the long list of recipients in the seat of Indi. I reflect that it's perhaps something in the water or, more particularly, something in the wine in her magnificent region, in particular when she recognised my good friend, Col Campbell
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
            OAM
           </a>
           , for services to winemaking. Col is a quite extraordinary winemaker in a fifth-generation winery, I believe. His best known product, Bobbie Burns, has been known to frequent the shelves in my own home and also in restaurants I've attended, and his fortified wines are quite extraordinary, so it's great to see Col recognised. Another good friend of mine, the Honourable
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Baxter" rel="nofollow">
            Bill Baxter
           </a>
           , received an award for service to the Victorian parliament. Bill has been a great servant in the National Party, but more importantly a great servant of his community as a minister and one of nature's true gentleman, just like Col. It's great to see both of those gentlemen recognised.
          </p>
          <p>
           I stood today to recognise one of my own Gippslanders who received recognition in the Australia Day Honours List. Gippsland, like Indi, is very well served by volunteers. The fabric of our community is certainly stitched together by people prepared to give of their time willingly. We have hundreds, if not thousands, of people who contribute an enormous amount of time each year. They don't expect recognition for the work they do, but it is good when they do receive some. One of the recipients this year on Australia Day was the Mayor of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_City" rel="nofollow">
            Latrobe City
           </a>
           , Counsellor Darrell White. He received a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Medal of the Order of Australia
           </a>
           , in the General Division. His list of achievements in local government and sport is quite extraordinary. He was a mayor prior to amalgamation in Morwell City Council, but also in the Morwell Shire Council. He's now mayor of Latrobe City. He is chair and co-founder of PowerWorks, a business information centre. He was the Gippsland Sports Academy chairman for 16 years. He's a life member of the Churchill Football Netball Club through services as president and treasurer. He was president of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
            Latrobe Valley
           </a>
           Tennis Association and is a life member after 14 years of service in that role. He was also president of the Churchill Tennis Club and president of the Morewell Tennis Club. It's quite a long list of achievements by one individual. It's people like Councillor Darrell White who are joining with me in fighting for the future of the magnificent Latrobe Valley region. The Latrobe Valley has a rich and proud heritage, but it has to have a great future. It's people like Darrell in his capacity now as mayor who are determined to make sure that the Latrobe Valley can go on to bigger and better things in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           The federal government has contributed significantly in recent times to the Latrobe Valley through its response to the Hazelwood closure. An amount in the order of $43 million has been put aside to work with the local community to see investment in projects that will help to create jobs. Darrell, as the mayor, is responsible for keeping local government on side. I'm pleased to say there has been a strong response from Latrobe city in terms of working with us in delivering projects in the region. There is record investment in infrastructure on the way in the Latrobe Valley right now with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Princes Highway
           </a>
           duplication project ongoing between Traralgon and Sale but also massive investment planned for the Gippsland rail line. As the former minister responsible for infrastructure and transport I was able to secure a deal with the Victorian government that will see in the order of $530 million being spent on the Gippsland rail line over the next four or five years. I'm keen to see that project rolled out in partnership with local businesses, maximising employment opportunities in our region.
          </p>
          <p>
           What we need to see in the Latrobe Valley is all levels of government working together. I'm looking forward to seeing the delivery of the Regional Jobs and Investment Package in the coming weeks and months, and I'm looking forward also to working with my community, with people, like Councillor Darrell White, who are passionate about the future of the Latrobe Valley to promote every opportunity possible for growth in the region. The Latrobe Valley is already a great place to live, it's a great place to work and it's a great place to raise a family and to visit. But it's people like Darrell, working with the community and through local government, who are going to make sure that we achieve our full potential and make it an even better place in the future.

            I rise to congratulate the Lindsay residents who have been recognised by the highest national awards for their exceptional service and achievement. The Australian system of honours was established 43 years ago. Prior to 1975 Australians were recognised under the British honours system, also known as the imperial awards system. We may want to defer to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
             Tony Abbott
            </a>
            , the member for Warringah, about his resurrection of the imperial system, but I'm quite comfortable with the way we hand these out now.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are 57 awards in the Australian honours system, and the best known is the Order of Australia.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order" rel="nofollow">
             The Order
            </a>
            of Australia is the pre-eminent way Australians recognise the achievements and service of their fellow citizens nominated by the community. The Order of Australia has four levels, as most people would know: the companion the officer, the member and the medal. Nominations for appointments and awards in the general division are considered by the Council for the Order of Australia, which makes recommendations for appointments direct to the Governor-General. I understand that there is quite an arduous process, and it sometimes takes up to two years for all this to unfold, for someone to be nominated and actually have the award bestowed on them. The council considers whether a nominee in the Order of Australia has demonstrated achievement at a high level, made a contribution over and above what might be reasonably expected through paid employment or whose voluntary contribution to the community stands out from others who have also made a valuable contribution.
           </p>
           <p>
            I often say that the strength of my community is the people, that we have the best people living in my electorate. I'm sorry to everybody else in here, but I'm going to claim that. I don't have a beach. I don't have the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
             Blue Mountains National Park
            </a>
            . But I do have the best people. The recipients of these awards in my electorate are the best of the best. In Lindsay we were honoured to recognise

             John Bateman
            </a>
            , who received an

             OAM
            </a>
            for service to local government and the community of Nepean. He was mayor of Penrith from September 1998 to September 2000. He established the Bateman Battersby Law Bursary, which supports students to undertake legal studies, and is the founder of Nepean Philanthropists. He gives a lot of his time volunteering for our community. Neville Barnier was awarded an OAM for service to people with a disability and to the community of Penrith, and this commendation is recognition for his volunteerism. Neville Barnier has had an extraordinary career. He has been involved in the Australian Foundation for Disability, or AFFORD, for thirty-four years and was chairman from 2014 to 2017 and has supported our local Penrith

            and Homes for Heroes in the western region. He is an absolute shining light of what people should aspire to be.

            , OAM, was awarded for his services to veterans and their families. He lives just outside of my electorate, but we'll claim him as one of our own—a bit like we do with Kiwis, except for a couple!
           </p>

             Queen's Birthday
            </a>
            OAM honours were awarded to: Elaine Wade, for service to the community of Penrith; Allen Cullen, for his service to special-needs education through Litle by Little and Kurrambee and also to trampolining, which I am told is a sport—I know nothing about it—and Shirley Gow, awarded for her service to children, as a foster carer, and to the community.
           </p>

             Kevin Connelly

             David Trist
            </a>
            for his service to the community through a range of organisations, which he often comes into my office and talks to me about; and Christopher Holden for his service to the community of Penrith. Quite often, we skip over those people who are not recognised on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
             Australia Day
            </a>
            . The smaller ceremonies that pass through on the Queen's Birthday in June often don't get the attention that the Australia Day Awards do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other award recipients I would like to speak about include Shiva Prakash, who is a general practitioner in my electorate. I know that he's been doing great service out there, because he was my
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
             GP
            </a>
            when I was young—I know that that was a long time ago. He's been a general practitioner practising medicine in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
             Western Sydney
            </a>
            , and has been doing so for a number of years, and now looks after the GP network. Another recipient was

             Barbara Mitchell
            </a>
            , an amazing advocate for humanitarian medical programs. The last person that I would like to mention, who was made an

             Officer of the Order of Australia

             Ron Mulock
            </a>
            . He was awarded in the Queen's Birthday honours list some many, many years ago now, but I would like to pay tribute given that we are talking about these very important honours. Ron Mulock, a good Labor man, was instrumental in instigating the Penrith Lakes scheme. He fought for a proper allocation of services and resources for Western Sydney and, in particular, hospitals. We don't see them like him anymore. These people are amazing ambassadors. They are amazing contributors to our community. I thank them dearly.
