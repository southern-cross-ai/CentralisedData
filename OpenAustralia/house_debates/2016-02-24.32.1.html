        We are lucky in Gilmore. We have three local councils working very hard for their residents. So, as their federal member, I cannot sit back and not comment on the proposed amalgamations for our local government area, threatening the councils of Kiama, Shellharbour and Shoalhaven.

        <p>
         For more than two years I have worked in tandem with these three organisations, and I am impressed with the work they do and the outcomes they achieve—and the support from the other side of the House. All three councils represent very different areas and community needs. So the suggestion that a merged council would offer greater services to its residents appears counterproductive in this large geographical area.
        </p>
        <p>
         The local communities have rallied behind their councils to protest the proposed amalgamation of Kiama Municipal Council with

          Shoalhaven City Council
         </a>
         and the

          Shellharbour City Council
         </a>
         with

         </a>
         . Community meetings, concerts and public information sessions have all been well attended, and residents were out in force at the public inquiries held across the region to present their statements and views to the

         Boundaries Commission delegate. The community spirit and sentiment shows just how important these local councils are to their respective residents and the importance of them retaining separate identities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand there is a need for some council mergers in urban areas; however, I do not believe this to be the case for the regional councils in Gilmore. They are great community catalysts. Amalgamating our local Gilmore councils seems to be both unpopular and unnecessary. It is not supported by the local residents. They are fighting to stay independent, and I support them every step of the way. I commend them for all the work they have been doing to retain their own identity.
