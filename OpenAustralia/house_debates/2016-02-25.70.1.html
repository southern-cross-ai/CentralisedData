        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. The honourable member for Herbert, more than most, understands the importance of the Defence Force, especially with that great garrison city, Townsville, at the heart of his electorate. The great
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Townsville" rel="nofollow">
          City of Townsville
         </a>
         is home to the 3rd and the 11th brigades, and to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions. It is the garrison city which has also had the experience, unfortunately, of not just talking about the theory of war but actually living the experience. Our nation remembers that on 29 July 1942 one of the bombing raids that happened in Townsville—and there were several—actually hit the agricultural station there.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also note the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         's involvement there through the No. 383, No. 452, No. 27 and No. 38 squadrons; the Combat Survival Training School; the Army's 5th
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Aviation Regiment
         </a>
         ; the No. 1 Expeditionary Health Squadron Detachment; No. 2 security squadron; and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Lavarack Barracks
         </a>
         and so much more. It just goes to show how involved this part of the world is.
        </p>
        <p>
         That the north of Australia does not deal with the theoretical but with the actual is and has been absolutely apparent. We must make sure that the north of our nation is defended if we want to protect the south. It is absolutely apparent and it has been a historical fact that the north of our nation is the point of embarkation. We remember around 7,000 service personnel who were killed during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         in the engagements in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          New Guinea
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         especially. I am sure we all pay that the due respect that it is worth. It is also the embarkation point to other places such as Guadalcanal and the Solomons.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is so important about the history of it, of course, is that it focuses our minds on the future, what we need to do and why this defence white paper is so vitally important. This defence white paper has been brought forward by the coalition because we understand quite clearly that it is in the development of the north and the protection of the north that our nation is protected. This works very well with the other programs that the coalition brings forward such as to develop the dams and to make sure we assure the biosecurity of the north. This is all vitally important. It is vitally important because we know that, if we populate the north with a vibrant economic base, we have the capacity more abundantly to make sure that the rest of our nation is well and truly protected from harm which comes our way.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that in part this white paper is to make sure. We obviously do not want a war. Who would want a war? From a family where many members have been in the Defence Force, it is absolutely apparent to me that the best way to protect yourself from conflict is to prepare yourself for conflict. The admirable people in the north—not just in Townsville but in Darwin and everywhere else—will be looking forward to us making sure that this is the very best white paper for the very best nation.
