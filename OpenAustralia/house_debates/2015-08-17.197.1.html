        70 commemorations went off with a bang in Townsville as well. My congratulations to the

        I was proud to convey the message from the Prime Minister, and his words, as per usual, were absolutely spot on. But it was all about the veterans who were there and the men and women who had served and held our city so well during that time. We thank you for your service. We thank you for your sacrifice. We are a greater country because of what you gave to us.
