       <p>
        I propose amendments of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 to include additional consequential amendments to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 will operate together with the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Legislation Amendment Act 2012 and make consequential amendments to Commonwealth legislation to reflect changes to the name of the Federal Magistrates Court and the title of Federal Magistrate. These government amendments will update relevant references in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code in accordance with the court's new name as the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the new title of Federal Magistrate as Judge. The amendments also include provisions to preserve the continuity of existing arrangements for functions exercised by a Federal Magistrate under the new title of Judge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed consequential amendments to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code were not included in the originating bill to allow for the necessary consultation with states and territories on the proposed reforms. Members of the House may recall that the jurisdictions entered into the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws in 2004. This agreement sets out a process for obtaining national agreement to any proposed amendments to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code and requires the Commonwealth to obtain the agreement of a majority of states and territories including at least four states prior to introducing any proposed amendments in parliament. The government is pleased to have obtained the agreement of jurisdictions in accordance with the inter-governmental agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also approved minor corrections to the explanatory memorandum of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 to correct descriptive information and typographical errors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill, as amended, agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that this bill be reported to the House with amendments.
