        On 24 August, Australia lost a truly great Australian: Frank Bartley Walker. He was a man of exceptional principle, intellect, humanity and passion. He was a man who was a great human being. On Monday night in this parliament, we discussed a private member’s motion on the subject of awarding Teddy Sheehan the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Walker" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        had been a champion for that, and the last time I spoke to Frank he said, ‘Make sure you get in there and fight for Teddy Sheehan to get the Victoria Cross.’ In fact, I had seen him at a meeting of veterans only the Friday before he left us. He was 89 years old when he died, and he was as sprightly as a 60- or 70-year-old. He was born in Hay. He went to

        and then to the

         University of Sydney
        </a>
        . He was employed by the

          Sydney Morning Herald
         </a>

        and he joined the Navy at the commencement of the

        </a>
        . He served on corvettes, and they became a passion of his.

        While Frank was in the Navy he wrote two books, and at the conclusion of the war he returned to the
        <i>
         Herald
        </i>
        . He was sent to

        was in 1948 when he was the only person who predicted that

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and his candid dispatches earned him the wrath of the United States government. Instead of deporting him, they withdrew his wife’s visa. He was a man who always championed a cause. After working with the
        <i>
         Herald
        </i>
        he worked for the Australian government in Immigration. Then he joined the diplomatic service, and he devoted his retirement to achieving recognition for Australian sailors who acted bravely. He was a truly great Australian. Frank had requested that a message be read at his funeral. I will read part of it:

       <p class="italic">
        During the war I had the honour of serving with shipmates who represented the finest breed of men our country has ever produced. I have a host of loyal friends whose companionship and support I cherished. For me it has been sunshine all the way, with very few rough patches. I would like this to be an occasion not for sadness, but for rejoicing that you knew a man who had a long, fascinating and satisfying life and lived it to the full.
