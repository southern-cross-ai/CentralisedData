       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of hosting an event to celebrate some of the most dedicated volunteers in my community who were recently recognised under the National Volunteer Awards. I congratulate all the recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, Nicola DeSilva. Nicola has volunteered her time at a local youth group at ImagineNations church on a weekly basis for over 10 years. I congratulate Nicola on the great contribution she has made as a youth mentor and supporter of charities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our next worthy recipient was Trisha Drummond. Trisha is a valued member of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Team. She is renowned for being hardworking, humble, gentle and intuitive. I congratulate Trisha on her great work with families and carers. Recognised for his work as founding president of the Association of Bhutanese in Australia, Sydney, I congratulate Om Dhungel. Om has been actively volunteering for many years assisting the Bhutanese community in sport, education and employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acknowledged for his many years of community activism, I congratulate Keith Heggart. As a youth mentor, member of the rural fire service, union representative and teacher, Keith has always gone above and beyond the call of duty. I thank Keith and congratulate him for his great contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our next recipient, Rossco Hutchison, has had a tireless commitment to the Penrith community over many years. Rossco has dedicated his life to assisting those who need it most in our community. His foundation has helped to raise funds and provide opportunities for countless local projects and charitable organisations.

        Our next worthy recipients were Alan and Gabrielle Moran. Alan and Gabrielle run prostate cancer support groups to provide assistance to newly diagnosed cancer patients, survivors, sufferers and carers. I thank them for all their efforts to improve the lives of others in our community.
