       <p>
        I rise to talk about a fantastic event in my electorate this Saturday: the Tweed Valley Relay for Life. I know there are many other 'relays for life' that occur, but it will be a great event this Saturday. Of course, it raises vital funds for the Cancer Council. We are very proud in our area to have this event on this Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        We now have 23 teams participating. I am really proud to be marching with the Labor team, to be part of this fantastic community event. Those 23 teams cover a whole range of different groups right throughout the community. We are there to raise funds for the Cancer Council and also raise awarenessâ€”and to acknowledge that so many people in our community have suffered from cancer. It is a good opportunity for us all to come together.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would really like to thank all the sponsors of the Relay for Life and also our local media, who have really gotten behind this important event. I thank them for the great stories they have written about the many teams that are participating. It is being held at the Cudgen Leagues Club at Kingscliff, and I would encourage locals to come along and either walk with some of the other teams or donate some money or buy some of the cakes that are being baked or to purchase some tickets in the raffles.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank everyone in the community who has come together for what is a very important issue, as we all look forward with hope to cures for the many cancers that have taken the lives of so many people in our families and in our communities. And I thank the management committee: you have done an outstanding job in organising the Tweed Valley Relay for Life this Saturday.
