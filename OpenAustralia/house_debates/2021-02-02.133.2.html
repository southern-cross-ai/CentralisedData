        One of the most pleasing things over the last decade in public office for me has been to see so many communities in my electorate, who come to Australia from parts of the world where they've suffered persecution or conflict and settled in the northern suburbs, become a vibrant part of our community. Today, I'd like to talk about two of those communities: the Chin Community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and the Association of the Burundian Community of South Australia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chin" rel="nofollow">
         The Chin
        </a>
        Community of South Australia have been around for 12 consecutive years since resettlement and they will celebrate the 73rd anniversary of Chin National Day on 20 February this year. That commemorates the event in 1948 when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         General Assembly
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Land" rel="nofollow">
         Chin Land
        </a>
        was held in Falam. The Chin people are a vibrant part of our community. On this day every year, they meet at Salisbury Villa Soccer Club and play soccer, volleyball, table tennis, rattan ball and Chin traditional wrestling. That day is obviously a big day of celebration for them. It involves sports, it involves community and it involves their religion. Most of them are Baptist Christians. They've done their very best to keep an essential part of their culture alive while integrating with the Australian community. I'd like to give a shout-out to Mr Van Bawi, who is chair of the Chin Community of South Australia; Mr Mang Bawi, the youth leader of the Chin Community of South Australia; and Pastor Mang Hlei Cung, who's the pastor at Adelaide Chin Christian Church, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Park" rel="nofollow">

        . I say to all of them that we certainly love having them in the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Burundian community is a very vibrant part of our community. They are celebrating their 15th anniversary in South Australia. They've been active with the    Burundian Men Drummers, the Burundian Women Dancers Group, the Burundi Eagles Soccer Club and a Christian choir. Their association has been led by many presidents: Leonidas Nitereka, Muhama Yotham, Charles Nzohabonayo, Modeste Hatungimana, Jacob Nduwamungu, and Elias Kabura. All of those individuals have provided leadership and built the Burundian community in the northern suburbs, and we're very fortunate to have them as great participants of our community. I send my congratulations to them.
