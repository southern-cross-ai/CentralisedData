       <p>
        Last week I was talking about gold medals for award-winning cheese in my electorate of Braddon. Wait; there is more! Last weekend, Braddon's golden girl, Amy Cure—I am so proud—won gold at the track-cycling world championships in Colombia. This is Amy's maiden senior world title. This was her third podium appearance in three days after Amy also took out bronze in both the team and the individual pursuit events.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Amy when she was a bright, bubbly little girl, when I would visit her family church. It was fairly evident to me at that time that she was a determined little individual. Amy's cycling career began in May 2005 when Amy and her sister Sarah joined a cycling group in Ulverstone and later became members of the Mersey Valley Devonport Cycling Club. Amy and Sarah shared an equal talent and commitment to the sport of cycling. Sadly, Sarah's sporting career was shot down through serious accidents and subsequent injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2006 Amy began training with Darryn Pugh, and she has also been working really hard in preparation for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        . Proud parents Graeme and Delwyn have been dedicated and passionate about Amy's potential, and they can stand proud and tall today. Amy has a huge career ahead of her, spending most of her time now riding in Europe, and in July I am sure she will join the Australian team to prepare for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Glasgow had better look out: Braddon's Amy is on her way! Amy, on behalf of a proud region: we are awe of your achievement.
