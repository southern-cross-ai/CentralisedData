         I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for that question and, of course, acknowledge his very long history representing police, particularly during his time with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          Police Federation
         </a>
         of Australia. National Police Remembrance Day is observed by all jurisdictions and on Monday, 22 September a number of speakers from all sides in this House supported a motion by the member for Werriwa to mark 29 September as National Police Remembrance Day. I am sure that the House would also want me to express support for the 50,000 men and women of Australiaâ€™s police forces who work in Australia and in our region to protect the lives of those who live in our civilian environment.

         It is shocking to realise that, in the past 20 years, 111 police officers have been killed on duty. This means on average nearly six a year. Unfortunately, it is mostly young officers who have their lives cut short while they are serving their communities. Out of those 111, 88 were constables. That means that the majority of those who lost their lives were under the age of 30. There were officers like Glenn McEnallay, who was ambushed and shot at close range by four men in Sydney in 2002 while he was sitting in his patrol car. Glenn McEnallay was 26. Last month marked the 10th anniversary since

         were brutally gunned down during a stakeout to catch two armed robbers. Their funerals, many will remember, touched the nation and, as a recent newspaper article on that anniversary mentioned, most police officers can tell you exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first learnt of that double murder. It is also important at this time to recognise the risks faced by officers serving offshore, who serve in unpredictable and often hostile environments.

         This year, for the first time since 1944, there have been no police deaths on duty in Australia. Hopefully, we can reach the end of 2008 without that situation changing. If you put your life on the line for the protection of the public on a regular basis, then you are performing a public service of the highest order. It is a level of selflessness that most of us never have to contemplate.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2006, more than 700 police came to Canberra from every state and territory to witness the commemoration of a national monument to recognise the service of Australian police officers who have died on duty. At the time of its dedication there were 719 names commemorated on individual brass touchstones. Next Monday, five new historical touchstones which date from 1884 to 1999 will bear the names of additional police deaths that have been discovered through ongoing research. It is obvious enough that police are essential to the fabric of a civilised society, and we must continue to show our support for the work they do. They have a unique status, and that is reflected in the exercise of powers that the community permits them to uphold the law. Confidence in the proper use of those powers is essential.

         , through its president Vince Kelly, has asked that the government give serious consideration to the creation of a national police service medal for serving police officers. The government has, of course, been very willing to examine that request in more detail. While I understand there is quite a lot of work to be done to advance that proposal, I am pleased to advise the House that the government is working closely with the relevant authorities to clarify the formal requirements and to consider the necessary protocols in detail. I believe we have to talk to the palace about these things.
        </p>
        <p>
         At this time of remembrance it is also appropriate that we give consideration to how we do recognise serving officers. I hope to be in a position to provide the House with an update on the matter of a national police service medal in the not-too-distant future. We thank the thousands of men and women in state and territory police forces and the

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the opposition I strongly associate the coalition with the remarks by the Minister for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Home Affairs
          </a>
          about National Police Remembrance Day. The courage, heroism and sacrifice of police officers in the course of their duty are a heavy price that they pay to ensure that we live in a safe society. Representing and leading a party room which has a number of former police officers in its ranks, we are very pleased to associate ourselves, as I said, with the ministerâ€™s very generous and eloquent remarks.
