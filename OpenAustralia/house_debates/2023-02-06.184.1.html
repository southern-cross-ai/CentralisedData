        Deputy Captain Ian Stevenson from the Branxton Fire and Rescue station 237 joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Fire Brigade on 1 June 1984. Ian served as a volunteer and then a retained firefighter until he was promoted to the rank of deputy captain in 2013. Not only has Ian helped protect our local community; he has protected New South Wales and Australia, for the past 38 years, from major fires—including dramatic structure fires—and from floods and motor vehicle accidents, whilst also being a vital team member and volunteer community first responder on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Ambulance service. Ian was awarded the merit certificate from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        for his efforts and duties performed in a horrific accident in 1993. He received a commendation for his meritorious service in the storms of 2007 and a commendation for his meritorious service at a tragic house fire in Singleton in 2019. His departure from Fire and Rescue NSW will be a major loss to our community and a major loss to a very close-knit family at the Branxton fire station. Ian is not only a true leader; to many he has been a mentor, a best friend and a father figure. His continued involvement, witty humour and appreciations will be sadly missed but always welcomed. Thank you for your service, Ian. Enjoy some downtime, buddy. Cheers.
