       <p>
        I rise today to talk about some wonderful work that is being done in my electorate in October for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer
        </a>
        Awareness Month. Tomorrow is the Women's Network
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        annual Pink Breakfast. It is an event that is held annually and it is very important for not only the awareness of breast cancer but also getting the women together. But, sadly, I am going to be here, so I will not be able to attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, one in eight women develop breast cancer in their lifetime. What is even more disturbing is that seven women die from breast cancer every day in Australia. So events like tomorrow's breakfast are really important for our community to make sure that women have access to information and also have access to each other. It is really important that people talk about the symptoms and signs of breast cancer because early detection is going to increase the survival rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also put on the record the fantastic work that BreastScreenNT is doing across the Northern Territory. The people there are making real differences in our lives by making sure that the awareness and early detection of this hideous disease is made known across the territory. I am very pleased about it and, as I said, I want to put on the public record the fantastic work that BreastScreenNT does.
