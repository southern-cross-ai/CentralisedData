        The federal coalition government since 2013 have invested over $5.3 billion in Capricornia alone. With another year coming to an end, I want to take the opportunity to provide a recap of the major infrastructure milestones that have been achieved in 2021.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's $25 million in funding for the

        repair and maintenance facility in Rockhampton as well as a loan of up to $30 million from NAIF. This project has the potential to create 225 jobs and inject $30 million into the local economy each year. The tendering process is open for the $1 billion Rockhampton ring-road, which will connect commuters to priority precincts and provide an alternative heavy-vehicle route. Construction is well underway for the $367 million Rookwood Weir, which will deliver 200 jobs and expand irrigated agricultural production into the lower

        region by providing an additional 86,000 megalitres of water.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's $8 million for the Fitzroy Community Hospice, which will provide access to comprehensive community based palliative care to

        . Funding is signed off for the $23 million Rocky sports stadium. Once complete, it will include grandstand seating for up to 7,500, an 800-seat ballroom and a multipurpose sports field. There's $20 million in funding signed off for the Keppel Bay Sailing Club, which will attract large corporate and sporting events to Central Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction is about to start on the $150 million Walkerston Bypass, which will become the designated heavy-vehicle route between the

        . There's $13 million for the Yeppoon Aquatic Centre upgradeâ€”the same facility where many children, including my daughters, learnt to swim, and that tradition will now continue for future generations. There is a further $12.65 million towards the Urannah Dam business case and approvals. This proposed project would include a new 970-gigalitre dam built 50 kilometres from Collinsville. There's $3.2 million for stage 2 of the Clermont Saleyards upgrade to increase the capacity of the facility to service the sales demands of the

        region. There is the opening of the $396,000 Sarina headspace, which has been delivering quality frontline support ensuring the best possible care for people who are at risk. So much has been achieved, but I'm going to continue working hard to deliver for our area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take this opportunity to wish everyone in Capricornia a very merry Christmas and a safe and healthy new year. Going into Christmas, I ask everyone to please continue to support and cherish the people in your life, especially those who might be doing it tough. And, of course, as we think about Christmas presents, I urge everyone this festive season to buy local, shop local and support our local businesses. I can't wait to continue representing Capricornia into 2022 and beyond. Have a wonderful break over summer and please stay safe.
