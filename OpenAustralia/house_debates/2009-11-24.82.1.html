        I rise to congratulate

         St Marys North
        </a>
        Public School on recently celebrating its 50th anniversary. I wish to place on record my gratitude at being invited to join in the celebrations last weekend. St Marys North is an outstanding local school in my community and an example of the final results that can be achieved when a school works closely with its local community to foster a spirit of trust and cooperation between staff, local families and local stakeholders. In fact, St Marys North’s school vision, ‘A community with expectations of achievement and success’, reflects its commitment to working with families to deliver quality education for its students.
       </p>
       <p>
        St Marys North was at one time the largest public school in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . These days, with its 370 students, St Marys North is by no means the largest school in my electorate, but it is a school blessed with committed and passionate teachers and staff, some outstanding young students, who are very active, and an enthusiastic Parents And Citizens Association. Earlier this year I was proud to visit St Marys North, where the Deputy Prime Minister announced a partnership with the New South Wales state government to provide more pay and resources for teachers in low-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        schools. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister was extremely impressed by the school, its students and its sense of community and I am certain that this extra funding will complement the new school hall that is being constructed and is due to be completed early next year under the Rudd government’s

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the current principal, Karen McSpeerin. She is a great educational leader, and her leadership has made a great difference to the lives of many. I also wish to acknowledge the presence at the weekend celebrations of former principals Kevin Hepworth and Athol Wilson. Congratulations to the entire St Marys North Public School. You are a great example of the difference that a school can make in the lives of children and their families.
       </p>

        I would also like to recognise the work of Jackie Greenow, who, as community liaison officer at St Marys North since 1996, acts as a link between families and students to provide them with the support they need. Jackie, who is a Penrith city councillor and former Penrith mayor, was also last night one of the finalists in the local government category of the National Disability Awards. It was an honour to join her and her son, Brett, last night in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        to recognise her work over the past decade in fighting for better access and opportunities for people with disabilities. In Jackie people with disabilities have a strong advocate, and I know that her work on

         Penrith City Council
        </a>
        has made a real difference to the lives of many. Jackie is an outstanding individual who has been a long-term champion for those in need in our community. I have known her for the past 10 years and I can attest to her commitment to her school community and to the city of Penrith. Congratulations, Jackie, for your work and your nomination. Our community is all the richer for having you as one of its representatives.
