        Josh Ogilvie: son to Angela and Doug, father to Chase, brother to Matt and Liam—a soldier, an athlete and a person I call a brother. I was heartbroken to hear of your passing, mate. You will be forever in all of our hearts, throughout the whole of the

        Josh, or Yogi as we know him, was a man mountain—huge. I would have said he was seven foot, but most likely he was probably only six foot three or four. There was no fat on him. He was just an amazing human being, and any time there was an issue, anytime someone was going through a hard time, Josh would be on the phone. He mentored so many. He saved so many from their demons and their wars within.

        This Friday we'll be burying you. We'll be saying goodbye. It feels like only yesterday we were on the phone and, whilst we've contracted together around the world, that was over in Dubai, working, saving and providing for his family. He'll be forever missed. We love you, mate.
