      <p class="italic">
       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 2 June 2008 to the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government about a petition submitted for the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville. The Minister has forwarded your letter to me as I have portfolio responsibility for regional development issues.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Funding of $10 million towards the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville has been identified as an election commitment made by the Australian Government and will be managed by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (the Department). A set of guidelines to administer the election commitments is currently being developed.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Government is committed to complying with its statutory obligations relating to approval of projects and their funding. The Government has to ensure that when it implements election commitments, its exposure to risk and the efficient and effective use of public money is closely managed in line with the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) good practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Department will be contacting the Townsville City Council to obtain the information necessary to undertake an analysis of the project.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I understand that this project has significant support from the Queensland State Government, which is contributing $14.61 million towards the construction cost and $2.5 million per year for five years towards the cost of running a supercar event.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I understand that the petition relates to objections of certain Townsville residents to fund the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville and they will be considered as part of the Governmentâ€™s consideration of this project. Any concerns Townsville residents have about the appropriate use of parklands should be directed to the Townsville City Council and the Queensland Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the
       <b>
        Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, Mr Gray,
       </b>
       to a petition presented on 26 May by
       <b>
        The Speaker
       </b>
       (from 5 citizens)
