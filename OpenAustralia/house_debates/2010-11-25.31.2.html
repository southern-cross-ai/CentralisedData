        Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the House expresses its deepest sympathy to the victims and families of the New Zealand mining disaster and to all

        . Today the Leader of the Opposition and I will together visit the New Zealand High Commission and sign their condolence book, formally recording this nation’s sympathy to the people of New Zealand. I have had the opportunity to personally convey our sympathy to the Prime Minister of New Zealand,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Key" rel="nofollow">
         John Key
        </a>
        . Many members of the House would have seen him speak at the press conference yesterday to confirm to the New Zealand people the tragic news that there was no hope for those underground.

        have shared this tragedy, as we have shared tragedies before in our history. This morning I am sure all members of this place want New Zealanders to know we are thinking about them. We are thinking, too, about the families of the two Australians, William Joynson and Joshua Ufer, who lost their lives in this tragic event. This is an awful event, pressing on a small place, Greymouth. After Beaconsfield and then Chile this year, I suppose in some part of our minds we were always hoping that there was going to be a happy ending. Unfortunately and tragically, there was not.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greymouth’s men will not be the last who are lost to a mine. Mining is a dangerous occupation. Australia is a mining country and we know what these men knew—that mining is a hard business. Every year Australia loses workers in mining accidents and that is something for all of us to reflect upon. So today we honour and mourn the loss of these men, men of hard work, men of respect. Their country, their community and their families are without them. I am sure that I speak for all in this parliament, and all in our country today, when I say to those who are grieving, both in this country and in New Zealand, that we are so very sorry for your loss.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I rise to support the Prime Minister. Obviously, every Australian is grieving over this terrible tragedy—29 brave and hardworking men are gone. Our hearts go out to their families. It is part of the Anzac solidarity that we feel for our brothers and sisters across the Tasman. Our thoughts and prayers are particularly with the families of the two Australian miners, William Joynson of the Fraser coast and Joshua Ufer of Townsville. Every Australian feels for them at this dreadful and difficult time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition commends the people who worked so hard to attempt a rescue. It is tragic for them that it was impossible to mount anything. I also commend the government for its assistance to the New Zealand government and would support any further assistance that the government thinks necessary at this most stressful and difficult time.

         <p>
          I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending condolences to the families of the 29 miners who have lost their lives in New Zealand. Coalmining is an important Australian industry and we have made huge advances in recent times in safety in this industry. But it is still dangerous and, sadly, from time to time we have experienced in Australia also significant loss of life, particularly in underground coalmining accidents. We therefore grieve for our colleagues across the Tasman. This is a major disaster for them, and the families and the people of Greymouth have obviously been very seriously affected.
         </p>
         <p>
          We think deeply of them and also, especially, of the two Australians.

          make a special mention of Willy Joynson, who lived in the same suburb of Maryborough as I do. I did not know him and his family well, and for the last 12 months he has been engaged in a contract at the mine in New Zealand. Willy is a lifetime miner. He has spent his life and his family have been involved in the mines in the Maryborough Basin over the years. When the Burgowan Mine closed in the Maryborough Basin he worked in mines in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Central Queensland
          </a>
          like Blackwater and Moranbah. He was a lifetime miner who knew the risks. He was always admired by his colleagues as somebody who was a good bloke and who people thought very highly of. He always had a smile. His family and children were well known and loved at the Parke State School just outside of Tinana. Certainly the people of Maryborough and district grieve at the loss of one of their fine citizens.
         </p>
         <p>
          I extend my particular condolences to Kim and Jonathan and Benjamin on the loss of their husband and father. He was a man who had given his life to the coalmining industry and now, sadly, his last resting place may well be in the workplace—which he enjoyed—and in which he made such a contribution over the years.
