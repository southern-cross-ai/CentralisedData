       <p>
        This August I had the privilege of visiting Caboolture Montessori School, where I met a group of primary school students who are extremely passionate about protecting and preserving their local environment. The students shared with me what they have been learning about the dangers of plastic pollution in the ocean and they told me they are deeply concerned about the future of our local environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plastic pollution is a serious environmental issue that is affecting the sustainability of our environment. Plastic waste is responsible for the deaths of more than one million seabirds, sea mammals and other marine creatures each year. I, along with the students at Caboolture Montessori School, agreed that this large number needs to become smaller. Jessica Green, one of the students, wrote me a letter explaining her fear about the plastic waste that is currently polluting our oceans. Jessica is worried about her future and the future of our beaches and marine environment. She is concerned that so many animals and species are dying due to plastic litter and is calling for leaders to take action and responsibility before it is too late. Jessica's fear is justified. If we each as individuals do not do what it is in our power to protect our environmental assets, our environmental assets will not last into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I spoke with Jessica and her fellow students I explained the importance of standing up for what was right and about the power of an individual to make a positive difference. These are the values of the Liberal Party and these are the values I believe in. It is these foundations that the coalition's direct action plan is built on. As the coalition's Queensland community environment ambassador, I am constantly encouraging parts of the community to get involved in activities that promote positive environmental action. Together with the Caboolture Montessori School students, I have organised a beach clean-up day for everyone who is interested in taking positive action to help clean up our environment to take part. I see this is as a chance for students, volunteers and community leaders to come together to make a big difference locally.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is truly encouraging to see young Australians like Jessica so passionate about protecting our environment. This beach clean-up day is just the beginning. I look forward to working with members of my community in creative ways to clean up our region. To make a real difference, we need everyone's help. I am asking everyone in my community to consider coming out for the morning of 26 October at Bongaree for a beach clean-up. If we all work together we can make a big difference to the environment by minimising plastic pollution.
