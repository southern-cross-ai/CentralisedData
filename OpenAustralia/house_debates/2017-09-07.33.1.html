        On the weekend, I was honoured to be invited to present the premiership medals and trophy to the Frankston and District Junior Football League's under-15 girls' grand finalists, the Mount Eliza Reds and Mount Eliza Blues. It was a miserable day, at least weatherwise, but a fantastic day for those on the sidelines to watch the two teams come together after the final siren and sing the club's song with so much gusto and pride. There was great sportsmanship on both sides. Congratulations to the Mount Eliza Blues on their win, bringing home the silverware as well as the best and fairest for the day. Thanks to the Langwarrin Junior Football Club for hosting multiple grand final matches across the day. The club's facilities are fantastic and the dedication of the parents and volunteers was much appreciated. It was also great to see the new electronic scoreboard up and running at Lloyd Park to which the federal government contributed about $15,000. The footy club and the cricket club share the scoreboard and clubrooms. It is wonderful to see our local clubs develop to the prominence of hosting grand finals for the region. I also look forward to seeing the $10,500 I committed during the election campaign to go towards women's amenities at the facility come to fruition as well.
