       <p>
        Last night, when the budget was brought down by the Treasurer, we had extremely good news for the taxpayers of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in terms of tax cuts, moves on superannuation and significant infrastructure funding as well as specific advantages for families through family allowances. In addition, I want to mention in the chamber the good news that we had at the Sharks football team with the announcement the Treasurer gave a week ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday, 21 April, my friend and colleague the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Costello
        </a>
        visited my electorate. The purpose of the Treasurerâ€™s visit was to announce an Australian government grant of some $9.6 million to be used to upgrade the home ground facilities for my local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        team, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronulla_Sharks" rel="nofollow">
         Cronulla Sharks
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sharks" rel="nofollow">
         The Sharks
        </a>
        are doing very well at the moment, with successive wins on the last three occasions, including beating the favourites, the Cowboys.
       </p>
       <p>
        This badly needed funding follows more than eight months of submissions to the government by both club president, Mr Barry Pierce, and me. It supports and mirrors that previously given to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George_Dragons" rel="nofollow">
         St George Dragons
        </a>
        , amongst others, which was some $8 million, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Panthers" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Panthers
        </a>
        , which was funded to the order of $10 million. This grant will be used to increase the comfort of patrons by providing more undercover seating and to provide disabled patron access and purpose-built seating as well as new lifts for the ground. The grant will also allow the Sharks to better ensure the safety of patrons. The provision of additional fixed seating around the ground, new secure turnstiles, secure entry points, improved lighting of public areas and closed circuit television monitoring will allow security to better manage the large crowds which regularly attend the facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps most importantly, this grant will allow the Sharks to provide better facilities for other users. The redevelopment of the ground will allow the club to provide meeting and conference facilities and special parking on the western side of the ground to cater for events such as the recent New South Wales Surf Lifesaving Championships, which were held on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronulla_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Cronulla Beach
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the grant will allow the Sharks to improve the environment surrounding their ground.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Toyota Park
        </a>
        is built on the edge of Woolooware Bay, immediately adjacent to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        protected wetlands which provide a habitat for various endangered migratory birds. The grant and the corollary development of Toyota Park will allow the Sharks to remove old structures and buildings and rehabilitate the channel on the western side of the ground, which flows directly into these protected wetlands.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the Treasurer made this announcement, he told the players that at his last visit to the ground the Sharks had an upset win over the Roosters. The same thing has happened on the last three occasions. This is a good sign. The Treasurer has also had a few home runs in terms of the budget last night, which has been extremely well received in my electorate and in all electorates throughout Australia.
