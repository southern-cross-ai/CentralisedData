       <p>
        I rise today to talk about carbon farming. As the son of a generational farmer I have a very close affinity with the soil and the land, so I come to this debate with knowledge of the land, the science in the soil and love for an industry which keeps our nation well clothed, well fed and employed. I also stand before you as the member for Riverina, a vast electorate filled with so many different arrays of farming methods. This government is all about keeping it green, however not in the way which best suits the land and the people of this nation. The coalition, in particular the Nationals, have been active supporters of carbon-farming initiatives for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        If implemented correctly, carbon farming will potentially deliver a new income source for farmers and deliver broader environmental objectives. Carbon farming is a prime element in the coalition's direct action plan. The initiative can be a win-win for the environment as well as the agricultural industry. It can meet the expectations of those who want to address environmental concerns. Carbon farming can help farmers improve their yield whilst at the same time make positive progress in improving the environment.

        Australia have been placed to enable wind breaks to stop the wind from taking the top soil and keep moisture in the ground, and to encourage native bird life. A minimal overall percentage of their farmland has been taken up. This sensible planning has added value to the property and income to the farmer and importantly reduced CO2 emissions to the environment.

        , understand the importance of carbon farming if it is done correctly, properly and so long as it is not taking up vast tracts of viable, arable farmland with pine trees, which you cannot eat and exportâ€”similarly to those managed investment schemes, which did precious little for regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government wants to sign farmers up for a hundred years, which is about three or four generations. Farmers will be locked into a scheme which a century from now could and most likely will be outdated, and other varieties and techniques will have been implemented. You only have to look at the past hundred years to see how much change there has been.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government also wants to take up vast tracts of good farmland by planting pine trees. Once they are planted they will be taking up good agricultural ground which in turn will be unusable for later generations. Pine trees will lock up the ground and very few people will be able to benefit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since coming to government this Rudd-Gillard and Green alliance has done very little for agricultural industry, so why should farmers trust it now? It is so typical of this government, which worries more about the 24-hour media cycle than good policy, particularly for farmers and particularly for regional communities.
