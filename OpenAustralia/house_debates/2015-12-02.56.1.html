        I recently visited Heatherwood School at Donvale, in my electorate of Menzies. Heatherwood is a secondary school for 273 students with mild intellectual disabilities. The goal of the school is to promote academic, personal, social and community growth. It also recognises the great contribution that parents and carers make, and their involvement is highly valued. This is a vital aspect of the school's culture. It recognises the importance of having a strong partnership between the school and its community to ensure the best outcomes for the students.

        I was there to present the students with a well-deserved Anzac Day award for outstanding achievement in commemorating the service and sacrifice of Australia's service men and women. The 2015-16 school captains, Kyle Horne, Maddison Rippon, Benjamin Cathery, Molly Drummond and Darion Foster, were on hand to accept the award and show me some of what they did, including their creation of a native garden in honour of their Anzac commemorations. Students also produced a book and wrote heartfelt letters to current service personnel in Iraq. I would like to particularly thank the commander of the joint task force in the

        , Rear Admiral Trevor Jones, for his very inspiring reply to the students at Heatherwood.
       </p>

        I was also able to meet the staff, tour the school, with its colourful splashes of student artwork, and witness the innovative driver education program, complete with buggies. I thank the assistant principal, Lesley Foster, for facilitating the visit. I am looking forward to the visit by students to parliament next year.
