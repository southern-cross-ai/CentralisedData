        My question is to the Minister for Justice. Will the minister inform the House how federal law enforcement agencies are making the streets of my electorate safer from the dangers of illicit drugs?

           <p>
            Perhaps I could have phrased that better, but I think the House knows what I mean. This is a very serious issue. Strong and prosperous communities are central to our government's plan to build a better Australia. Too many of the lives of our communities around the country are blighted by organised crime. It remains a serious threat to the social and economic fabric of Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Crime Commission
            </a>
            recently noted that organised crime costs our community up to $15 billion a year, and the illicit drug market remains the principal source of income for organised criminals. It is this government's commitment to take steps to strike at the heart of this market and to give the law enforcement agencies the resources and the powers they need to go after organised criminals and drug dealers. This is a change in direction for this government compared to that of the previous government, which, budget after budget, cut the resources to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. I am pleased to report to the House the significant work that has been done in targeting the illicit drug market in the past short while.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the six months to January this year, federal law enforcement agencies seized over $1 billion worth of illicit drugs. This is $1 billion that has been taken out of the criminal economy and over three tonnes of drugs that are not circulating on our streets. Cocaine seized was over one tonne, with a street value of $427 million. Over one tonne of precursor chemicals have been seized, with a street value of $220 million. Specific operations include Task Force Eligo, which, while being primarily aimed at money-laundering, has resulted in the seizure of over half a billion dollars of illicit drugs, the seizure of $26 million of cash and the restraint of more than $30 million worth of criminal assets.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagine what could have been achieved if the previous government had not cut savagely the budget of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The Australian Crime Commission, the body that is tasked with fighting organised crime, had its budget cut by 30 per cent under the previous government—30 per cent. It had its personnel cut by 30 per cent under the previous government, and yet they have still managed to do an extraordinary job in tackling organised crime and tackling the illicit drug market. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Federal Police
            </a>
            had their budget cut by $128 million under the previous government, and I congratulate both of these agencies for what they have been able to achieve even though the previous government tied one hand behind their backs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new government will tackle organised crime and the illicit drugs market, and we will support the agencies that are tasked with doing it.
