        Soccer Club celebrates its 50th anniversary and to mark the occasion on Saturday, 28 June the club held a 50th anniversary black and white ballâ€”black and white being the club's colours. It was a night of celebration and reunion and the presence of several founding members, along with many past and present players, coaches and committee members, ensured that there was much to talk about. Chairman

        , Keith Puyenbroek and Stephen Nurse all provided snapshots of the club's history, whilst a rolling screen with photos and film clips added to the memories.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1964, when the club was established, Para Hills was a new residential community with most of the residents being new arrivals from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        . Their passion for soccer soon saw the Para Hills soccer club established and quickly proving to be a force in the local soccer league. In 1977 the club outgrew its original location on Nelson Road in Para Hills and relocated to its current club rooms at Para Hills Paddocks recreation precinct. The new club rooms enabled the club to further grow and to become even stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1998 the club was successful in being selected as a training venue for the Italian, Spanish, Chilean, Korean and Nigerian teams competing in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Olympics" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 2000. To comply with its bid, professional standard lighting was installed and the pitch was prepared to international standards by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Burdett" rel="nofollow">

        , the expert groundkeeper at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Oval" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Hosting the international squads was indeed a highlight in the club's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Its reputation, however, equally grew through its performance in the South Australian Soccer Federation and the many outstanding soccer players that the club has produced over the years, including Australian national team representatives Martin Crook,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mullen" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Mullen
        </a>
        and, most recently,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McGowan" rel="nofollow">
         Ryan McGowan
        </a>
        . It was indeed fitting that, as the Knights soccer club celebrated its 50th anniversary, 24-year-old Ryan McGowan was in Brazil representing Australia at this year's world soccer cup.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to those who have represented Australia and whom I mentioned earlier, many other Para Hills Knights players have gone on to successful soccer careers with other clubs both within Australia and overseas, including Ryan McGowan's younger brother Dylan. Today the club continues in fine form in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_Premier_League" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , also fielding several women's teams and, as from day one, it proudly selects its senior side predominantly from local young players developed through the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with many clubs, the Knights owe their existence to the many volunteers and committee members who have guided the club through good times and bad. These are the tireless workers who never say no and who at times have made substantial personal sacrifice for their beloved club. There are too many for me to individually acknowledge, but I thank and commend them all for their service to the Para Hills Knights Soccer Club and to the community that I represent.
