       <p>
        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Canada and Germany, 14 to 28 April 2007. Earlier this year I was honoured to lead a parliamentary delegation to Canada and Germany. Today I am pleased to present the delegation’s report. The visit provided a valuable opportunity for the delegation to explore a variety of issues with our Canadian and German counterparts. We were able to find out about current political, social and economic developments in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" rel="nofollow">
         North America
        </a>
        and Europe. We also promoted opportunities to broaden and strengthen Australia’s relations with Canada and Germany.
       </p>
       <p>
        During our time in Canada, we found there is much that we share in common, despite our geographical separation. Our parliamentary systems, our strong economies and the challenges we face give us much to talk about and much to learn from each other. The delegation was particularly interested in the way in which Canada is dealing with the employment challenges generated by an economy enjoying strong growth as a result of a resources boom. Importing of labour to fill shortages in key industry sectors is one option being used. One downside of a low unemployment rate is that traditional industries such as agriculture often find it hard to get workers to undertake much of the manual work associated with the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation heard about the successful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_Agricultural_Workers_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program
        </a>
        , which sees around 20,000 workers come to Canada from Mexico and Caribbean countries to undertake seasonal agricultural work. The details of the program are outlined in the delegation’s report. The key point is that the program works because there are incentives for all participants—workers, employers and the participating countries—to make it work. Given similar labour issues facing Australian agricultural industries, the applicability of a similar scheme to Australian circumstances would be worth exploring.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation’s report also focuses on discussions we held with Canada’s Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harper" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Harper
        </a>
        , and a range of federal ministers. An important point emphasised during those discussions was Canada’s eagerness to work with Australia in promoting democracy and good governance in regions of the world where there is a democratic deficit. During the meeting with the Prime Minister, the delegation advocated an expansion of the working holiday-maker arrangements that allow young Australians to work and holiday in Canada.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation’s report outlines opportunities for Australia to broaden its ties with Canada. I was particularly interested to find out about the financial administration of the Canadian parliament, including its role in setting and administering its own budget. To broaden our links with Canada, the delegation has suggested that a committee exchange program be explored with the Canadian parliament, similar to that which Australia currently has with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Germany, the delegation was fortunate to meet with a range of parliamentary, industry and community representatives. During those meetings, it was made evident that European and trans-Atlantic relations are a primary focus for Germany. At the same time, there is a growing recognition of the increasing influence and importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This could have future benefits for Australia, as Germany seeks to take advantage of economic opportunities in our region. The delegation was interested to find out about Germany’s eagerness for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        to move beyond its primary European focus and pursue partnerships with like-minded countries outside of Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental issues were also a focus of discussions, with the delegation attending a parliamentary session at which the German environment minister delivered a major policy statement on the environment and climate change. Details of the German approach to these issues are outlined in the delegation’s report. The delegation welcomed the opportunity to visit an agricultural community outside of Frankfurt. There we were able to find out about a cooperative approach to dealing with challenges in the industry, as detailed in our report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Canadian and German parliaments, led by their presiding officers, for the warmth of their welcome, for the interesting programs that were arranged and for their generous hospitality. Thanks are also due to our
