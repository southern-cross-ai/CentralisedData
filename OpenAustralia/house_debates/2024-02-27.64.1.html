        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. I refer to Labor's new family car and ute tax. In my home state in Victoria in 2023 78 per cent of sales were either
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV" rel="nofollow">

        s or light commercial vehicles and utes. The top-selling cars were the

        ,

         Toyota Hilux

        and Isuzu Ute D-Max. Industry analysis shows that they would attract penalties of up to $17,000, $14000 and $13,000 respectively by 2029. Why does this Labor government want to punish Aussie families and tradies for their choices?

          Under standing order 100, questions must not contain statements of facts unless they can be authenticated nor contain hypothetical matter. The question is based on a false premise, and we should not be spreading disinformation in this chamber in questions or answers.

                    I again very much welcome the question and the chance to correct the misinformation being put by those opposite. The member for Flinders would be interested to know that her average constituent drives 18,911 kilometres a year and would save $1,503 in fuel costs if they had access to more efficient cars. The member for Flinders might want to explain to her constituents why she is against more choice for them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is the latest example in a long line of misinformation we have had. We have had the continual claims from those opposite about car prices. The analysis released by the minister for transport and I made very clear that in no country that has introduced vehicle efficiency standards have increases in the price of cars resulted from that policy. The member for Bradfield agrees with that. He said it himself on many occasions when he was very eloquently putting the case. This is just the latest example of misinformation.

                      <p>
                       The Leader of the Opposition said last week on 9 February:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       Now, we have some of the highest efficiency standards in the world in terms of our vehicles …
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There are a couple of small problems with that statement. You could argue about whether they were the highest or the lowest if they existed, but the fact of the matter is Australia doesn't have any fuel efficiency standards—a point that was made by the member for Bradfield in his op-ed in the
                       <i>
                        Australian
                       </i>
                       when he said:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       Eighty per cent of the global vehicle passenger fleet is subject to fuel efficiency standards, but Australia has none.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We've seen other examples. A man who's received a bit of attention in question time today, Senator Canavan—not the most outrageous thing he said, but it's pretty outrageous—said the government of Australia has decided to introduce the world's most aggressive emissions limits on vehicles here in Australia. This is clear misinformation when you consider, I confess to the House, the standards that the minister for transport and me are consulting on proposing are less ambitious than those that exist in Europe,
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

                       We have carefully designed them to deliver benefits to the Australian people—$140 billion in benefits to all Australians between now and 2050 and $12 billion in fuel savings for motorists by 2030. The average new car buyer in 2028 will cut their annual fuel cost by around a thousand dollars. Health benefits, which is why this policy has been welcomed by the

                      <p>
                       This is what good policy looks like: careful consultation over a 12-month period, taking many submissions and putting Australian motorists first, while those opposite put Australian motorists last—equal with the motorists in Russia, where the Leader of the Opposition wants to align his policies.
