       <p>
        I am pleased to rise to speak about a remarkable boy, Connor McLeod, from Oakhurst in Sydney. Connor; his mum, Ally; and the member for Chifley came to see me this week with their idea to introduce tactile bank notes to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Connor is visually impaired. He told me about the significant difference tactile banknotes would make in his life. He is frequently forced to pay for things using only coins because these are easier to distinguish. Connor told me how he received money from his relatives for Christmas last year but was unable to determine for himself how generous his relatives had been. Tactile banknotes would make a major difference to the lives of more than 300,000 Australians with a visual impairment. Connor showed me an example of a tactile banknote from Canada. Many other countries have adopted tactile banknotes. It is possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge the government to instruct the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        of Australia to introduce tactile banknotes to Australia as soon as possible. Most Australians take for granted the ability to tell the difference between banknotes. Visually impaired Australians deserve to be as independent as they possibly can be. I will continue to work with Connor and his mother, Ally, to make sure this important advance for visually impaired Australians becomes a reality.
