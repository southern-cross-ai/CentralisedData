        Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said:

       <p class="italic">
        You will make a difference in the world, but not immediately. Your first obligation is to find something you like doing, because if you like doing it, you'll do it well.

        speech, it has been 'traumatic' here in parliament, and being in Canberra I can tell you that everyone has felt shocked, distressed and sick that a young woman who was a staffer could experience sexual assault in what is a second home. This should never happen. Women and men should always feel respected, protected and listened to.

        I support the independent inquiry into Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces led by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins to address the cultural and structural changes that need to happen. Indeed, all of us across parliament are very focused on this, and, hopefully, it will be our parliament that shows leadership in the future on these very important issues, as we continue to work through how things will be and must be different.
