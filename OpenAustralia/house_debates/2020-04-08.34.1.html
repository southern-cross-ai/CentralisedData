        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the latest measures the Morrison government is taking to help workers stay connected to their employers and to keep people in jobs while the coronavirus crisis continues to unfold? Treasurer, isn't this further proof that we will do what it takes to ensure that Australia bounces back stronger?

         I thank the member for Boothby for her question and acknowledge her deep commitment to ensuring that her constituents get as much support as they need during this very difficult time for them and for the nation.

         Today is one of the most important days in the history of this parliament. Today we reach across the political divide to pass legislation that will save millions of Australian jobs. Today the people's house will deliver for the people of Australia. The JobKeeper payment is an economic lifeline for millions of Australians. It's a game changer. A $1,500 flat payment paid every fortnight to those who are eligible is equivalent to around 70 per cent of the median wage. And in those sectors that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus—namely retail, hospitality, tourism—in many cases it can be around 100 per cent of the median wage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This package is costed at $130 billion, the most significant package that has been brought to this parliament to support Australian jobs. Those who are eligible are part-time workers, are full-time workers, are casuals who have been with their employer for 12 months or more, are sole traders and are those who are working for the not-for-profit sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform the House that as of 10 am this morning more than 730,000 businesses had registered their interest in the JobKeeper program on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         website. For those employees and employers who are looking for more information: treasury.gov.au. There are around six million Australian workers that we believe will be able to access this scheme, and it will provide a very significant economic lifeline to them at this very difficult time. But what's most significant about the JobKeeper program is that it will maintain that formal connection between the employer and the employee. It will make it easier for Australians to stay in a job and for businesses to keep them in a job. We're very focused on the recovery phase, and the JobKeeper program will help the Australian economy bounce back stronger than ever.
