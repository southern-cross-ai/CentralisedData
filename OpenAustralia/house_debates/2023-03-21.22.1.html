        Last week I got to represent Prime Minister Albanese at the Queensland Irish Association's

        dinner. I came on to speak after 10 pm, which was quite an experience! There were a lot of good speakers at the event, including the Irish Minister Simon Coveney and members of the Irish government delegation. He spoke well, as did Tim Mawe, the ambassador of Ireland, but the best speaker was a bloke called

        , the rugby player, who happens to be my constituent. I also ran into someone called Aileen Cater-Steel, from the

        Irish Club, who came up after my speech and introduced herself as my relative. It turns out my mum, Peggy Morrissy, and my great-grandmother, Ellen Long, were all from the Darling Downs, from Deuchar, near Alloraâ€”just some of the 75 million people around the world who celebrate St Patrick's Day. I know there are many in this chamber. It was a great event, and I look forward to some great trade opportunities with Ireland coming up, as it becomes the gateway to Europe, as the United Kingdom has a slightly different engagement with Europe. I also particularly thank Minister Simon Coveney for, in his speeches, both there and at the Irish embassy last night, affirming that all
