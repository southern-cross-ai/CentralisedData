       <p>
        I would like to use the last few minutes available to reiterate my concern about the member for Maribyrnong and the case of Mr Lee he spoke about yesterday. I would like to say that further to this, regardless of whether the offence might have been reversed, there is no guarantee that Mr Lee’s rating of ‘fair’ for 1955 would have been upgraded to ‘very good’. Mr Sercombe characterised the most recent response from the Prime Minister’s office—one of six—as ‘total nonsense’. In truth, the reply highlights that military discipline is not subject to political interference. It is not appropriate for the Prime Minister to intervene in matters of military justice, either current or from more than 50 years past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Sercombe sought justice, fairness and a proper process. In Mr Lee’s case, that is precisely what he got. Justice is represented by the Navy justice processes of the day. Fairness is epitomised by the six reviews of the situation. The proper process sees that individuals must meet exacting criteria to be given such important awards. If this approach is not maintained, a progressive degradation of the recognition occurs. Mr Sercombe’s initial point is absolutely critical: such awards must be in recognition for something. They must be earned and deserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the time left to me, I would also like to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWCA" rel="nofollow">
         YWCA
        </a>
        in the electorate of Gilmore on receiving $220,000 to mentor youth in the Shoalhaven. It comes under the partnering employment pathways program, funded under the Australian government’s Mentor Marketplace program, and those participating in the program will be provided one-to-one mentoring opportunities with carefully matched mentors, with a broad aim of providing employment and training outcomes. The program targets young people aged 14 to 25 who are at risk of becoming or are currently long-term unemployed by providing the skills and encouragement needed to keep their lives on track, to stay in education or to gain employment or training opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The partnering employment pathways program in the Shoalhaven is run, as I said, through the YWCA New South Wales, which was established 125 years ago to work with women and families, providing opportunities for them to meet their potential. In New South Wales the YWCA has over 900 members, employs 178 staff and has almost 800 volunteers. In the Shoalhaven area the YWCA has successfully delivered a number of programs for young people, including Links to Learning, job placement, employment and training, Positive Futures, youth enterprise projects and Work for the Dole. The YWCA in my electorate of Gilmore deserves this recognition. It does an enormous amount of work for the young people in our area, and the mentoring program is such that I actually put my hand up to become a mentor for these young people because I believe in its importance.
