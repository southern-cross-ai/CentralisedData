        My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of measures the government has taken to improve Australia’s international air services? Are there any alternative policies?

         I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise her particular advocacy for regional aviation. In fact, she is probably the only person in this House to have an aircraft named in her honour, and it is a thoroughly deserved recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is committed to growing and expanding international aviation. We have worked very hard to improve the services in and out of Australia, and that has achieved real dividends. We have had record numbers of passengers in and out and a record number of seats available to and from Australia, and that has been achieved against the background of events like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
          SARS
         </a>
         and September 11, which certainly sent shock waves through international travel.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will be continuing to pursue these objectives in reaffirming and expanding our policy in relation to international aviation. We have declared our recognition of the importance of open skies as an aspirational goal, the need to negotiate air services ahead of demand and the importance of maintaining our access to key aviation hubs around the world. We have also, though, recognised the important contribution that an Australian based aviation industry makes to the economy. It is a balanced policy that looks to achieve the very best for our country.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the

          US
         </a>
         -Australia route—about which there has been a lot of controversy over recent times—it is important to note that there is already significant competition potentially available on that route, with scores of airlines having the right to operate it if they choose. Many have tried and failed, but there is still significant competition available on that route. The interest of two Australian airlines,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Blue" rel="nofollow">
          Virgin Blue
         </a>
         and Jetstar, in entering the route opens up the potential for real competition with a different type of product than that which might have been available under some of the other options that were under consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
         The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative policies. In spite of the fact that there has been debate going on for years about the trans-Pacific route, the opposition put out a statement just two weeks before the government announced its policy in relation to this issue. Their policy is, ‘Federal Labor is open-minded on air route liberalisation.’ They had no policy; a complete vacuum. The Leader of the Opposition is now talking about his big target policy and how he is going to lead in these sorts of issues, but when it comes to aviation, they are ‘open-minded’; they have not made up their mind.
        </p>
        <p>
         What about when it comes to keeping jobs in heavy maintenance work in Australia? The opposition gives lip-service to wanting Qantas to maintain its heavy maintenance activities in Australia but as we speak the very workers whose jobs are at risk are on strike. They are invading the Melbourne domestic terminal and demonstrating to their employer that they cannot be relied upon to do the job when it matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         If we want to maintain these jobs in Australia, and this government certainly does—we want these skills to be developed and maintained in Australia—then the workforce also has a role to play. Going out on strike in the very weeks when Qantas are making key decisions is sending a very wrong message to the Qantas board. I call upon the workers to play their role in negotiating appropriate arrangements which would allow these thousands of jobs, critical jobs for Australia, to remain in this country.
