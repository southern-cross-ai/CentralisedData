        Mr Speaker, earlier today in the House of Representatives, while at the dispatch box, I was approached from behind by the member for Warringah—

         Order! The House will come to order. If the House would be quiet, I think we could get this over and done with fairly quickly.

          who made numerous interjections and threatening comments. Could I ask you, Mr Speaker, as you were not in the chair at the time, to consult with the member for Hughes, who was in the chair at the time, examine the tape and report back to the House at a future time in accordance with whether it is appropriate for any further action to be taken.

           I will deal with this very quickly. I will firstly make four comments. First, that was not really a question to me at this time because this time is for questions about administration, so I am trying to be consistent about that. Second, I will not look at the tape because I am trying to be consistent about that. Third, the member of the Speaker’s panel has my utmost confidence in the way that she conducted the proceedings at the time. The fourth point is that the basis on which I am able to confidently say that is that I happened to be watching at the time. The ruling that the Deputy Speaker made at the time was a legitimate ruling.

            If the two ministers want me to deal with this, they will remain quiet. I would not wish them to pre-empt what I am about to say, because I may not say it. I have said that I will not be reviewing tapes, but what I am about to say might cause the member for Warringah a little grief. I am confident in making the statements I have made about the member of the Speaker’s panel because, at the time, I was watching. The problem for the member for Warringah is that if it had been just the vision that I had to base a conclusion on I would have left the matter at this point. Regrettably for him—and this is not saying that the Deputy Speaker may not have heard what was said—there was a live mike. He did make one comment audibly that it would probably assist the chamber if he now withdrew.
