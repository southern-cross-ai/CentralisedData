       <p>
        Sport has always been an important part of local community life in my electorate. As the host of a number of Olympic venues in the 2000 Sydney games, the people of the Greater Penrith region do not need much of an excuse to embrace the spirit of the greatest games on earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        At these Olympics our local community has had much to be proud of. And no - one has made us more proud than
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Fox" rel="nofollow">
         Jessica Fox
        </a>
        , who in her first Olympics , at the age of 18 , claimed a silver medal in the K1 c anoe s lalom event. Jessica is a well-rounded, high achiever and a wonderful person. She is a great role model for young people, not just in our local area but right across the country. Apart from her silver medal, Jessica has already achieved other career highlights such as a d ouble Junior World Champion ship and as Youth Olympic Champion in 2010. Out of the water, Jessica has also achieved remarkable academic success, particularly during her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        last year, when she was named academic dux of Blaxland High School, topping
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in the subject of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDHPE" rel="nofollow">

        and receiving an ATAR score of 99.1.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jessica has a fine pedigree when it comes to her exploits on the water, with both of her parents having been first-class paddlers. Jessica had the rare privilege of competing against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepanka_Hilgertova" rel="nofollow">
         Stepanka Hilgertova
        </a>
        from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         Czech Republic
        </a>
        , who actually competed in the 1996 Atlanta Games against her mother, Myriam Fox-Jerusalmi. Jessica's father is the Australian national performance director and was one of the key figures that helped secure the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Whitewater_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Whitewater Stadium
        </a>
        and the paddling events for Penrith in the 2000 games. I know that Richard and Myriam, like the rest of our community, are immensely proud of Jessica's efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also representing us on the water was another outstanding Penrith canoeist, Robin Jeffery. In 2011, Robin was selected for the Australian squad, and in the same year he went on to win the C1 event at the national championships.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_London" rel="nofollow">
         In London
        </a>
        , we watched Robin and his partner, Kynan Maley, make it into the men's canoe double semifinals. I congratulate Robin on his success and wish him all the very best in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also very proud of our very own Hockeyroo, Jade Close. Jade was added to the national women's squad in 2011 after only six appearances in the senior Australian ranks. In London, we proudly watched Jade in her finest striking form as she secured the only goal in a tough match against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        . The Hockeyroos put up some great performances in London and Jade was an integral part of the team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I congratulate star basketball player
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Nielsen" rel="nofollow">
         Matt Nielsen
        </a>
        . Matt was a Penrith junior who has gone on to great success on the international stage. His remarkable skills played a strong role in helping Australia reach the quarter finals in men's basketball. I congratulate Matt on this great achievement and wish him and his family all the best for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all of these athletes, we say thank you and congratulations for your outstanding contribution and the fine manner in which you have represented our community.
