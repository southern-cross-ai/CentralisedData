        It's no secret that I love a good feed and an occasional beer, and there's no better combo than enjoying them both together at a good pub. My electorate has no shortage of great watering holes worthy of a beer and a feed with mates or even with your family. The Great Northern Hotel in Teralba is one of those great pubs with a great feed. It's not only that it has the best cold beer and the meals are tasty; they are cheapâ€”just like me! Let me tell you, the cheap meals certainly don't sacrifice quality. In fact, the Great Northern Hotel in Teralba was a finalist in the 2023

        Awards for Excellence for Best Cheap Eat Meal. How cheap? How does $10 sound for lunch? You would struggle to buy the ingredients for that price.

        They have quite a range of options, too, from delicious burgers, fish and chips to chilli loaded fries. For those who don't enjoy meat as much as I do, you can even score yourself a salad. So, if you are in or around the Teralba area and want a good feed at an even better price, get yourself to the Great Northern Hotel. Bring your mates. Bring your work colleagues. Bring your family. I can't think of a better day than to have a weekend lunch there with a good cold beer and a lovely cheap eat.
