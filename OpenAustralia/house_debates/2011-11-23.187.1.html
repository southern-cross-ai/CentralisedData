        Dementia is the third-largest killer of Australians today. It is anticipated that by the year 2015 there will be one million Australians suffering from this disease. This figure does not include the family and friends who also suffer as a result of this cruel and incurable disease. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        , Alzheimer’s disease and dementia play a devastating role, especially in the Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigenous people are between and four and five times more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease than non-Indigenous people. The prevalence of this disease combined with the poor state of health care is having a devastating impact on communities and rural areas across Australia, particularly in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        People with Alzheimer’s disease often require a high level of constant care and, unfortunately, this burden is often left to family members. Eighty per cent of care for Alzheimer’s and dementia sufferers is provided by family members. In Australia, there are over one million Australians who care for a person with dementia. Many of these carers receive no funded services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Access Economics predicted that dementia will create the biggest single strain on the hospital and residential aged care budget in years to come. By the 2060s, spending on dementia is set to outstrip any other health condition. It is projected to be $83 billion and will represent 11 per cent of the entire hospital and residential aged- care sector spending. According to Aged Care Alliance, aged-care reform that does not have a strong focus on dementia will not be successful. Dementia can no longer be considered an issue affecting only a small population of older adults in aged care; rather, it must be at the core of both residential and community aged-care service provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has recently been reported to me that in my electorate Alzheimer's patients at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Darwin Hospital
        </a>
        stay in a constant-care ward, Ward 7C. This ward is filled with beds separated by blinds and curtains and is closed off from the rest of the hospital. It is really not an appropriate place or suitable for people with Alzheimer's, who often also have other mental health issues. If a patient wants to leave the ward they must be escorted by a family member, friend or staff member, which also puts additional stress on the staff. I understand that some of these patients have actually stayed in the ward for over a year. This in itself places a huge burden on an already stretched health service, not to mention the pressure on the staff and the families.
       </p>
       <p>
        This disease is no longer a problem just for older Australians. Early-onset Alzheimer's and dementia are becoming more common. We do not have the facilities or understanding in the community to properly deal with this emerging issue. There needs to be appropriate funding and this government, in my view, is not taking the issue seriously enough. I have been asked to be a champion of Alzheimer's, and that is what I am doing. I will raise awareness and bring it to the attention of this House.
