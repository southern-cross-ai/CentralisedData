       <p>
        Everyone in my community knows that I am an unapologetic sports tragic and a huge advocate for the benefits and opportunities that being involved in sport, on and off the field, can bring all of us, but particularly young people. So one of the great pleasures and privileges of being the member for Dunkley is being able to assist young people with Local Sporting Champions grants. Last week I hosted a group of young sporting champions from across the electorate—different sports, different schools—to celebrate their sporting success. They did themselves, their parents and their schools proud with the way they conducted themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was one young woman who wasn't able to come, Isabella Lowe-King, because she was competing. She sent me an email after the events to tell me this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I've just returned from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWF" rel="nofollow">
         AWF
        </a>
        Youth &amp; U23 Weightlifting Nationals in Perth and so happy to let you know that I came 1st in my weight division, broke 4 Victorian records and also a Personal best in the Snatch &amp; Total categories, so it was a very successful event for me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly! She went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I just wanted to thank you so much for the grant of $700 under the Local Sporting Champion Program. The grant assisted with the costs in many ways and was very much appreciated. It was so great to have my family there to support me as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Isabella sent me some photographs of her competing, and I find it extraordinary that such a small, compact young woman can lift such a huge weight. I wanted to thank her for keeping me updated about her success.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank her for mentioning how great it was to have her family there, because the other thing we know about young people in sport is that it is made so much easier for them if they do have family and friends to support them. We also know the sacrifices that are made by parents and grandparents and carers to help the young people in their lives to be able to participate in their sport; to give them those opportunities to learn about community, responsibility, teamwork; to learn that they can be strong and tough and brave and graceful; to learn that they can play baseball, do gymnastics, play football, play hockey or do equestrian, whether they're a boy or a girl; and that they will have some great successes and they will have some not-so-great competitions. But what they will take out of their time in sport is lifelong friends, lifelong memories and, for many of them, opportunities to work professionally in an area that they love.
       </p>
       <p>
        So congratulations to all of the young people who, over my time as your federal member, have got awards, and I look forward to many more presentation ceremonies in the future.
