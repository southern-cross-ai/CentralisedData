       <p>
        In the last election campaign the coalition government made an election promise to give $4.5 million to the Ballina Hospital. In the same election campaign the previous Labor government made an election commitment to give $3 million to the emergency department at the Casino hospital. I have got good news, Mr Deputy Speaker. The $4.5 million we allocated to the Ballina Hospital for new imaging equipment and a new operating theatre will be going ahead, but I was also able to convince the health minister to honour the previous government's commitment of a new emergency department at Casino. I visited the hospital soon after the election and saw that it was badly needed.

        Last week we announced the good news that Woollam Constructions had been awarded the tender to redevelop the emergency department at the Casino and District Memorial Hospital. This new emergency department will include: a new triage area; two new resuscitation bays; ambulance entry, which will be redesigned for all-weather and safer entry and exit of ambulances; four new treatment bays; relocation of the waiting area to be in close proximity to the reception and triage; piped medical gasses to be provided to the emergency department's resuscitation bays; a multifunctional safe assessment room; a dedicated staff room; a public toilet in closer proximity to the waiting room; a refurbished clean utility room; and improved security. This hospital badly needs it and I am pleased to announce the new tender.
