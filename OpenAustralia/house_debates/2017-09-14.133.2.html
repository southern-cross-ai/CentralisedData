        The idea of the Victorian parliament without
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Richardson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is unthinkable. Indeed, the idea of the Labor Party without Fiona makes no sense at all, and the idea that Fiona will not be an indomitable part of the political world in which I live is just so hard to imagine. Throughout my life in politics, when a difficult issue has presented itself and rooms have become filled with differing voices and opinions, it's been a reflex to ask: what does Fiona think? Three weeks on from Fiona's death, I find myself still asking that question.
       </p>
       <p>
        The truth is that Fiona was a colossus on the stage of Victorian Labor, and she shared that stage with her husband and our colleague Steve Newnham. I first met Fiona back in the 1990s, working on resolutions that would go before the administrative committee of the Victorian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Her mind was sharp; her attention to detail, absolute. There was more chance of the earth reversing its rotation than of Fiona missing a fact or making a mistake, and she argued her case with a fierce determination that left the rest of us feeling both inadequate and in awe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet the intimidating nature of her intellect did not extend to her personality, for she possessed a smile that could melt the coldest of exteriors; it changed moods. One flash of it and you knew that, no matter how deep the problem, it would all be okay. Fiona was friendly and warm and, because you so desperately wanted her on your side, inevitably you found yourself on hers. Fiona was a born leader. Fiona was also brave—so brave—and hers was not the faux bravery born of fundamentalism; it was so much better than that, because Fiona knew how to negotiate. She knew how to compromise. Fiona absolutely lived in the land of the real. Her willingness to risk her own fortunes in order to stand up for what she believed to be the right outcome was both compelling and outstanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fiona departs this world with a shining legacy. As the shadow transport minister, she can proudly claim to have been the author of the Andrews government's programs of removing level crossings. Watching the incredible episode of

        focused on Fiona's own experience of family violence speaks to the power of her work as Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Violence" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This is a terrible scourge in our society, and, when the battle against it is finally won, history will record Fiona's name as one of the greatest heroes in the struggle. For all this, it is her bravery that to me stands as her greatest political legacy—because being brave was not enough for Fiona; she wanted all of us to be brave with her.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a moment in time when my voice should have been louder, it was Fiona who exhorted me to use it. She challenged me to be better and assured me that it was possible to overcome the fear of bravery, and I can still hear her voice vividly. Over the last three weeks, as I've shared that story, I have learnt in turn that her exhortations were not just to me but extended to many of us. While we will never be as brave as her in supporting us and seeking to bring out the best in us, there is now an entire class of contemporary Labor politicians who owe our opportunity to her, and, hopefully, we will be better because of her. That is a profound legacy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite all this, Fiona would say her biggest achievement was her family: her children, Marcus and Catherine, and her husband, Steve. She was utterly devoted to them, and their loss is so desperately sad. Most of all, our thoughts and love are with them. But, if there is any comfort in the face of Fiona's death far before her time, surely it is to be had in the knowledge that she made an enormous difference. Her life has mattered, her children carry her spirit, and her memory and her example will live on in all of us.
