        On 21 July 1942 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Imperial_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Japanese Imperial Army
        </a>
        , having leap-frogged through South-East Asia, reached the village of Gona on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hatsuo Tsukamoto and Colonel Yosuke Yokoyama, the Japanese army moved inland over the coming week to take control of the small inland village of Kokoda. By 29 July, the Japanese had accomplished this task and had, importantly, taken control of the Kokoda airstrip. A limited number of Australian soldiers serving in Kokoda at the time had put up a brave fight but were overcome by the sheer numbers of the Japanese and forced to retreat.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Kokoda under their command, the Japanese then set their eyes on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
         Port Moresby
        </a>
        —a perfect platform to launch an attack on the Australian mainland. Over 10,000 members of the Japanese South Seas Force took to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">
         Kokoda Track
        </a>
        and began the 96-kilometre trek over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Stanley_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Owen Stanley Range
        </a>
        to the capital, Port Moresby. The Japanese were fresh from China, well equipped, well trained and fully prepared for the advance before them. As they were beginning to make their march to Moresby, the Australians were thin on the ground, poorly trained and without sufficient logistical support. But as the Japanese began their move to Moresby, what they did not count on was the determination of the Australian 39th Battalion and elements of the 49th and 55th battalions, whose mission it was to defend Moresby from the fast-approaching enemy.
       </p>
       <p>
        What ensued over the coming months were long and bloody battles at Isurava, Brigade Hill, Ioribaiwa and Imita Ridge. With the help of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        nationals and reinforcements in the form of two battalions from the 21st Brigade, the Australians fought with a courage that all their comrades in arms were proud of then and would remain proud of. After six months of fighting, Australian troops, assisted by their American allies, ended the Japanese campaign on 22 January 1943. By this time thousands of brave young Australians lay dead, and many thousands besides lay wounded. Kokoda is the stuff of Australian legend. Kokoda epitomises the great Australian spirit. Kokoda in many, many respects is Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I walked the Kokoda trail in April with my son Nicholas; the Minister for Human Services,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Hockey
        </a>
        ; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koch" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and his team in a group of 30 men from Brisbane and Sydney. Thousands of other Australians have done the same in recent years. It is not a walk, it is certainly not a holiday; it is a pilgrimage. We were able to see with our own eyes where these young Australian heroes lost their lives for their country, a country which they loved very much.

        That is why it is disturbing to now see reports that the Kokoda Track may well be under threat. An Australian mining company has taken control of the mining rights of the Mount Bini district, which is located along the trail itself. I note that the mining company in question has been quick to deny that its operations will impinge on the track. The managing director of the company is on record as saying that ‘none of the track would be affected’ by mineral exploration or possible future mining. But I also note that the managing director of the company has conceded, according to the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald_Sun" rel="nofollow">
          Herald Sun
         </a>
        </i>
        of 15 July:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ...the Kokoda Track ran through the middle of land his company had acquired the right to explore.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not intend to sully the name of the company in question. But I do want concrete guarantees that the Kokoda Track will not in any way be damaged by mining exploration or operations. It is for this reason that I seconded a motion moved earlier today by the member for Hotham which calls on the Australian government and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)      work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Government of Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        to protect the natural environment and the historical integrity of the Kokoda Track;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)      ensure the safety and enhance the significance of the Track for visitors and walkers by improving the amenities and interpretive materials, and protecting the memorials along the Track; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)      report back to this House within 12 months on progress in implementing these actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wholeheartedly support this motion. I have also written to the government of Papua New Guinea expressing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        ’s concerns that the mining operations may endanger the track. Labor expects that the Australian government will do everything in its power, in partnership with the government of Papua New Guinea, to protect this living monument to our country’s heroes and the heroes of Papua New Guinea who made their mission possible—a mission in defence of our country.
