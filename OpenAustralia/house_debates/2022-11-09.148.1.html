        Our community and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        have lost a legend with the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Kenny Williams
        </a>
        at the age of 93. Kenny was the Sydney Swans' No. 1 supporter and a lifetime member. He was the team's hydration specialist and lead club song singer. His rousing renditions of 'Cheer, cheer', including after the 2005 and 2012 grand final victories, will live long in our memories. I'll never forget the day I was doorknocking in Kingsford, and I met Kenny. I appreciated the time that Kenny gave me to tell me about his history with the AFL and our community. For Kenny Williams, footy was more than just a game. It was about community and connection. He never, ever missed a game. And now, we will sorely miss him.
       </p>
       <p>
        It started out with a passion for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
         South Melbourne
        </a>
        Swans Football Club, and when Kenny moved to Sydney at the age of 21 to become an apprentice jockey at Randwick he missed his home team. As luck would have it, in 1982 South Melbourne moved to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCG" rel="nofollow">
         SCG
        </a>
        , a little over a bounce away from Kenny's Kingsford home. Kenny helped to bridge the divide between Sydney and Melbourne, and he brought together generations of players and footy fans with his legendary dinners at the family home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Swannies' next win will be bittersweet. The song simply won't be the same without Kenny leading it. We won't have Kenny with us, but we will have his spirit. I offer sincere condolences to his wife, Yvonne, and his daughters, Diane and Cheryl. Vale Kenny Williams. May he rest in peace.
