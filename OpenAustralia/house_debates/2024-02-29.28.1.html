        Labor wants Territorians and all Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Every one of the 120,000 taxpayers across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        will get a better, fairer tax cut under our changes, and 84 per cent will get a bigger tax cut than they would have under the plan of the former member for Cook,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . That was legislated five years ago, and we want to make sure that Territorians have more support to meet their cost-of-living challenges. The other 16 per cent of Territorians will still get a substantial tax cut, and I think that's important to remember. When it comes to Territory women, we have bigger tax cuts for 89 per cent of them, and the other 11 per cent will still get a substantial tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        These tax cuts complement continuing reforms by our government to address women's economic inequality, which is a real issue, including in the Territory. We also have reforms to close the gender pay gap, to support workplace flexibility and security and to rebalance unpaid care work. We want Territorians and all Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn, and that has been demonstrated in the policies that we continue to bring into this place and legislate for all Australians.
