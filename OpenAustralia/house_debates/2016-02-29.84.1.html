        My constituency question is to the Minister for Health. Research has found that Australia has some of the highest rates in the world of babies born with permanent brain damage and other disabilities where their mothers drank alcohol while pregnant. In my electorate of Murray there are some 50 cases of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder identified. Can the minister update the House on the status of the government's $9.2 million National

        Action Plan? It is a great plan, and it is good to hear about it.

         I take pleasure in answering the question from my good friend across the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
          Murray River
         </a>
         the member for Murray about an important topic she is absolutely passionate about and for which she has flown the flag in this parliament for as long as I can remember—not an easy cause, but she does need recognition for the work that she has done. We on this side of the House have dedicated just over $9 million to the original Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder Action Plan and we are going to continue the work that we have already started. It builds around educating clinicians so that the right diagnostic tool can be brought to bear to understand the needs of the person. It brings the resources that are around the country together in a single hub. It does further work on education and understanding, and that is a really powerful commitment that we make.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an important cause—and the member for Murray understands that—because, in the absence of biomarkers, the presentation often of a child with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASD" rel="nofollow">
          FASD
         </a>
         is that they have problem behaviours. It is not that they cannot do; it is that they will not. Their difficulties are misunderstood. They are often medicated, often described as having
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
          ADHD
         </a>
         and, before we know it, they have turned into an adult with problems, difficulties and enormous challenges. However, we also know that with the right neurobehavioral early intervention, when that plasticity is still in the brain, we can actually make a difference to these children. It is so important that we do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said, it is not a popular cause—not one you hear much about—but I am very delighted, as is my colleague who has portfolio responsibility for this important area, the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Rural Health

         in the other place, to continue with the important work around this. I remind everyone that alcohol causes harm during pregnancy, and that is a very strong message that we also need to deliver.
