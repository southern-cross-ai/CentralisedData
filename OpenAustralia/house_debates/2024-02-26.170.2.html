        I have been visiting many schools within our Fowler electorate to present my leadership awards, also known as the 'believe and achieve' awards, to select the students in recognition of their resilience and grit in the pursuit of knowledge and learning. I also paid a visit to our inclusive schools, such as Mainsbridge in

         Warwick Farm
        </a>
        , Les Powell School in

        and

        </a>
        , and Lawrence Hargrave School in Liverpool. I can't tell you how inspired and touched I was seeing the dedication of our teachers and carers striving to provide the best learning environment for the young students and their families. These amazing teachers play such a pivotal role in shaping the future for students, especially those with disabilities, behavioural disorders and mental health illnesses. I saw first-hand how dedicated and committed they were, working tirelessly to accommodate the diverse needs of their students, and in a challenging environment such as staff shortages and lack of funding, especially for infrastructure such as air conditioning when working from demountables.

        Governments federal and state should look at the future of education overall and prioritise the needs of schools in lower socioeconomic areas such as Fowler and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        so that students receive the education and opportunities they need to thrive, be productive and become empowered citizens of this nation. Once again, thank you to all the teachers in Fowler for your commitment and hard work to support our diverse community. Please note that your passion and hard work do not go unnoticed.
