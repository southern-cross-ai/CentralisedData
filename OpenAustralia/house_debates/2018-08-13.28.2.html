        Members would be aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         Brendan O'Connor
        </a>
        's wife, Jodi Dack, passed away last week. On Friday, Brendan put out a beautiful statement letting us know that Jodi passed way surrounded by her close family, those who loved her best. Jodi was wise, she was strong, she was funny, she was gracious, she was generous and kind, and she lived life to the fullest—traits that are so evident in their most precious daughter, Una Rose. Brendan also has tweeted an article that I would encourage people to read, by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
         Nick Ryan
        </a>
        in the Adelaide
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        , that refers to Jodie's bravery without actually naming her—but that's who it's about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many members have got in touch with Brendan, but obviously, at this difficult time, there are no words that help and I won't pretend that there are words that help. It is simply for Brendan to know that, from all members, the sympathy is real and the sympathy is strong. The solidarity that Brendan conveys and offers so strongly himself right now is there with him and with his family. And, if more time is needed, more time will be given.
       </p>
       <p>
        From all of us, and I'm sure I speak for both sides of the chamber, our deepest sympathies; and from those who pray, our prayers for everyone, whether they pray or not. Our thoughts are with Brendan and his family at the most difficult of times.

         Just very briefly, if I could associate the government with the Manager of Opposition Business's very generous and kind comments about the member for Gorton, we also pass on our condolences to Mr O'Connor, and to Jodi Dack's other family members. It is a very sad time for
