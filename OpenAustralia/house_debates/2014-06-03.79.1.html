       <p>
        On indulgence, Madam Speaker, to update the House on an incident, I am advised that a decision was taken last night to intervene and end a protest at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island_Immigration_Detention_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre
        </a>
        in order to maintain good order and return it to normal operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Protesting detainees were requested to disperse from the medical area of the green heart in the centre of the facility on a number of occasions. The Serco Emergency Response Team,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERT" rel="nofollow">
         ERT
        </a>
        , was called in to assist with managing the situation and all detainees were again provided with the opportunity to return to their accommodation compounds. The majority of detainees were compliant. However, I am advised a small number exhibited noncompliant behaviour. The Serco ERT continued negotiations with those detainees who were refusing to comply.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports to me suggest some detainees became aggressive and were subsequently restrained and moved from the green heart area. At about 12.40 am, local time, protesting detainees had been cleared from the central area, with the majority moved to other compounds. All detainees were assessed by medical services provider
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHMS" rel="nofollow">
         IHMS
        </a>
        . I am advised that two detainees suffered minor injuries arising from noncompliant behaviour and were treated on site by IHMS. A further four detainees were taken to hospital for a range of injuries, including suspected sprains or broken bones. One detainee has suffered an injury to his wrist. No staff were injured.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am advised the facility remains calm. However, the department's detention service provider continues to monitor and support all detainee compounds.
