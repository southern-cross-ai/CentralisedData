       <p>
        June is Lipoedema month. Lipoedema, many in this place may not know, is a condition which causes fats to be distributed irregularly in parts of the body, particularly around the legs. I recently met with Carla Daly, who was diagnosed with lipoedema at the age of 55. She said to me that there is no cure, that it is a genetic disease and no amount of dieting or exercise can reverse itâ€”although it can help manage the condition.

        It is a chronic condition that causes pain and lack of mobility for many sufferers. Carla is quite brave, like many other women in her situation. To help raise awareness of lipoedema, this month Carla took part in a photographic exhibition to raise awareness about the disease. The photographs were unveiled in a special exhibition in Bendigo a few weeks ago. Carla and other sufferers spend their lives trying to dress appropriately and hide their condition, so to take part in the exhibition was both traumatic and empowering. Carla said:

        Finally, I had the support from other women who have felt the pain, the shame and the humiliation that I feel nearly every day. They'd lived with it and they understand what it is like.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is great to have the sisterhood so we can have this open discussion. This month being lipoedema month, it would be great to see more support for sufferers.
