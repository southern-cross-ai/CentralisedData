        I've never been prouder to be the member representing the south-west Brisbane and Ipswich suburbs than I have seeing my local community rise to the challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak over the last few months, which has simply been remarkable. We've had so many community groups, businesses and organisations contact my office looking for ways to help those that are in need in our community during this time. By working together, we have seen many vulnerable Australians, who would otherwise have fallen through the cracks, be heard, supported and cared for during this difficult time. On behalf of everyone who's received your support and care during this time, I thank you. I salute you.

        The economic impact on small businesses, the some 13,000 businesses in the Oxley electorate, has been tragic. We've seen many local businesses suffer. I was proud to support our local chambers of commerce, the Springfield chamber of commerce and the Centenary &amp; Districts Chamber of Commerce where we have launched a campaign called Tuesday Check-in where we highlight local businesses that are open and operating in our community through social media platforms. On top of this, I was proud to partner with one of my local state members, Jess Pugh, the member for

        , sponsoring free coffees for essential workers at our local cafes this week.

        I want to mention the incredible dedication of the community groups, churches and emergency relief centres for stepping up to the mark and supporting our community. To all the churches and volunteers, thank you from the bottom of my heart and the community for all that you've done: supporting people, looking after people. Together we'll continue to look after each other and get through COVID-19 together.
