       <p>
        I rise to recognise the efforts of a number of our local schools who were recently recognised in the Queensland government Showcase Awards for Excellence in Schools. The awards program is designed for Queensland state schools and has seven categories that aim to: recognise, celebrate and reward excellent teaching practice in state schools; foster a learning culture that supports sharing excellent practices; create professional development opportunities; and promote public education.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to say that out of the seven categories, schools in our local community walked away with awards in four of those categories. For the south-east region, Norfolk Village
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_School" rel="nofollow">
         State School
        </a>
        won the award for excellence in the early and primary years. We had two schools take out the award for excellence in inclusive education. Eagleby Learning College was awarded for the program It all STARTS here, and Pimpama State School was awarded for the Multi-Tier Model: Improvement for All. Eagleby State School took out the award for excellence in community or industry partnerships.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are fantastic achievements that bring much joy to all involved. It is a great credit to the schools in formally recognising their achievements. It has been heartening over the past few months to catch up with our local school principals and to see the wonderful programs that are occurring in all our local schools, and I wish them all the best for the future.
