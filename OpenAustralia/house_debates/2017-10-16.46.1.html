       <p>
        On Saturday, 7 October, I had the pleasure of attending two important events on the Canning agricultural calendar: the Live Lighter Perth Hills Festival and the Waroona Show. The Live Lighter Perth Hills Festival, formerly known as the Karragullen Expo, is an annual exhibition showcasing the northern hills of my electorate. What started as a machinery field day has evolved into a local attraction for orchardists, producers, growers, hobby farmers and families alike, and it welcomes thousands of visitors each year. Events like these don't happen without the tireless work of the community. So thanks to Bruno and Brett DelSimone and the volunteers from the Hills Orchardist Improvement Group for another great event. Likewise, my congratulations go to the people of Waroona for yet another successful Waroona Show.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Waroona Show goes from strength to strength each year, and with over 15,000 people through the gates this October it is not hard to see why it has been crowned the biggest one-day show in Australia. Highlights from the day included celebrating 50 years of De Rosas Highway Motors as one of the major exhibitor and presenting awards to Patricia Hillary-Nheh and Barbara Sturges for their outstanding cakes. I note that Barbara has taken out the Yarloop

        trophy for most points in a cake competition for the fourth year running. Well done, Barbara.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, this event wouldn't be possible without the 100-odd volunteers who give up their time or without the hard work of the Waroona Agricultural Society. A special thanks to President Maree Ellis, Senior Vice-President Eric Walmsley, Junior Vice-President Donna Walmsley and Secretary Alison Birch for their hospitality.
