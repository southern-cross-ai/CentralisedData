        My question is to the Prime Minister. Clause 2.2 of the Prime Minister's own statement on ministerial standards states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A Minister shall not act as a consultant or adviser to any company, business, or other interests, whether paid or unpaid, or provide assistance to any such body, except as may be appropriate in their official capacity as Minister
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the minister clearly provided assistance to Nimrod Resources in a private capacity on his trip to China, how can the Prime Minister possibly argue that the minister has complied with the Prime Minister's own ministerial standards?

         The Leader of the Opposition has asked me the same question twice now. Rather than going through the same answer twice, let me just remind him of this—

         I thank the Deputy Prime Minister, who has asked me to do it again. I think I will stick to a more succinct—

           It was raised yesterday, and yesterday I asked the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to investigate the matter and advise me on it and to ascertain all of the facts and circumstances surrounding it. That is the process that is to be undertaken. The government cannot be criticised for being slow in reacting. We set in train the appropriate process immediately the matter came to light. The secretary will diligently look into the matter and he will provide me with advice, and then I will make a decision.
          </p>
          <p>
           The remarkable thing about the opposition is this parallel universe in which they live. We have a government presented with an issue and we immediately take the appropriate course of action under the code of ministerial standards—exactly what we are required to do. On the other hand, we have in the parallel universe of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party a world in which trade unions can trade away, negotiate away, the penalty rates of some of Australia's lowest paid workers in return for an undisclosed payment of money from the employer, and they think there is nothing wrong with it. Really! We are not going to be lectured on accountability and integrity by that opposition.
