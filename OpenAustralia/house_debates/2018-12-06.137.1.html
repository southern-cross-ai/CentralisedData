       <p>
        Firstly, I want to wish all local residents in Dunkley a merry Christmas and a happy new year. It is an important time of year to spend time with our families, our parents, our grandparents and our young ones. Supporting young people and local families has been a passion of mine since I was elected nearly 2½ years ago. I've fought persistently hard to ensure that our local sporting clubs and community clubs have the support and the facilities they deserve to engage our youth and create a healthy environment for all to enjoy. My ongoing advocacy for grassroots sports facilities in Dunkley has been reflected in many of the meetings I have had with the Minister for Sport and other ministers so that we can continue to fund our local tennis, soccer, football, cricket, basketball, netball, baseball, bowling and other facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also proud to have delivered for many clubs across Dunkley, whether it's under the Stronger Communities Program, the Community Development Program or other funding rounds. But there is always more fighting to be done, and I will continue to advocate for local clubs in Dunkley. Most recently, I've been advocating to the Minister for Sport for funding for Langwarrin Tennis Club. I was pleased to previously secure funding for solar panels for their club to assist them in lowering their electricity costs, as well as $3 million for a new multipurpose facility at Lloyd Park for tennis and other uses. They're also in need of upgraded courts, lighting and the redevelopment of the tennis club, so I've been fighting hard for improvements to their club house and surroundings.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also fighting for the completion of the Frankston Dolphins Junior Football Club clubroom upgrade and fit-out and the netball courts. The coalition government previously provided funding of $300,000 for new lighting at the ground, which has been completed across the two ovals, and I'm further advocating for funding to complete their clubroom upgrade and fit-out as well as their amazing new netball courts. This project would hugely benefit from the funding they are seeking. Our electorate needs these facilities and our players and users deserve them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Separately, I would like to mention the situation of Nepean School in Seaford. A few months ago, Nepean School, which services people living with a disability in my electorate, had a $12,000 teepee burnt down by vandals. After that—and it was reported in the local media—I set up a GoFundMe page calling for donations to help rebuild the teepee and other facilities for children with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        We received nearly $2,000 of donations for that. I'm also proud to announce today that, in a partnership with 123Read2Me through our Stronger Communities Program funding, I've secured an additional $5,000 towards that project and $1,500 has been contributed in kind through material for the teepee. That means that we have several thousand dollars now committed. I call for people to donate further funding at the link I mentioned to enable the teepee and other facilities to be completed.
