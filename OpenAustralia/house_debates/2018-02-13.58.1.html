        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. Will the minister outline to the House how the government's investment in defence industry projects like the

         Joint Strike Fighter

        will generate thousands of jobs for hardworking Australians, create a stronger economy and ensure our national security? How does this compare with other approaches?

         I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I know she has a particular interest in the success of the

          Joint Strike Fighter

         program because one of the companies that's had the most success out of it is Marand, which is a company that has a presence both in south-eastern Melbourne and in Geelong, where they employ at least 50 local residents of her seat, working very hard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today is a really important day in the Joint Strike Fighter program. It's a red-letter day because we passed over a billion dollars worth of exports because of the Joint Strike Fighter program. It's an incredible result. We'd hoped to pass a billion dollars, but we're there earlier than we'd expected, and by 2023 we should be at over $2 billion worth of exports. The Turnbull government's agenda around defence industry—

           around highly advanced technological jobs in defence industry is clearly working. This is a national project that employs around 5,000 Australians, and that number will only grow. We in the Turnbull government have decided that if we're going to have the biggest build-up of our military capability in our peacetime history—$200 billion—while capability will always be number 1, number 2 should be Australian industry content, driving jobs, investment, growth and research. Because we on this side of the House believe in growing the economy and having jobs for the economy, whereas the Labor Party only has policies to try and out-green the Greens in Batman.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is also a national project, so companies all around Australia are benefitting, companies like
