       <p>
        On Wednesday 10 June, I joined Marcelle Van Gasselt, manager of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bega_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Bega Valley
        </a>
        's child support and early intervention service, Playability, to announce the government's decision to extend their funding for another two years. Playability provide support services for many of the district's families, including those who have children with disabilities. Earlier this year, Playability was informed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        that the funding for their mobile toy library, and supported playgroups, was to cease. I met with Playability, listened to their concerns, and then proceeded to make representations on their behalf to the Minister for Social Services.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is very clear that Playability do a great job for Bega Valley families. They have an excellent reputation for interacting in a sensitive manner with families facing the unquestioned challenges of caring for disabled children. They have been fulfilling this important role for over 30 years. Although they had funding for maintaining some of their other services, including support for Indigenous families, cut backs meant that they would have to stop some services and face difficult budgeting and staffing decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon review, the minister restored funding of nearly $350,000 for the next two financial years, and I thank him for that. This provides more certainty for Playability to continue its support for Bega Valley families and maintain employment for its dedicated workforce. I am proud to be part of a government that, while fixing Labor's budget mess, can prioritise the genuinely needy in a disadvantaged part of Eden-Monaro.
