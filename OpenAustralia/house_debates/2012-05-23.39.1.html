       <p>
        Between 28 April and 6 May this year, the 13th Croquet World Championship was held in Adelaide and hosted by several Adelaide based clubs. Eighty world-ranked players from 24 countries competed. Australia is the largest croquet-playing nation in the world, with some 8,000 players.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club in the Makin electorate was selected as one of the host clubs. I am familiar with the Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club, having visited it on several occasions. I can vouch for the professionalism of its management committee, currently led by very hardworking locals Peter and Kaye Rostron, the well-kept facilities and the terrific team approach taken by all members to ensure that the club runs well.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 2 May I was able to visit the club and watch a couple of the world championship matches. As I expected, the skills of the players competing lived up to what one might expect in a world championship.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I also expected, the Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club members ensured their club made its contribution towards a successful championship, which I understand was won by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Bamford" rel="nofollow">

        , of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who defeated Australia's Robert Fletcher in five games.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to congratulate the South Australia Croquet Association for hosting the 2012 world championship. I particularly congratulate the Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club for being selected as a host club and, in so doing, bringing some of the world's best croquet players out to the local community.
