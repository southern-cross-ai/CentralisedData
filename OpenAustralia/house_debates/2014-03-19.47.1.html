       <p>
        Today I rise to speak about a wonderful program that many of my colleagues have spoken about over the last few weeks—that is, Youth Connections. Youth Connections helps disengaged young people, generally aged between 13 to 19, to reconnect with education, training or employment. Youth Connections helps over 30,000 young Australians each year, around 20 per cent of whom are Aboriginal or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        . A recent study of the program found that 62 per cent of young people entering the program were generally completely disengaged from education, but that six months after exiting Youth Connections, 94.2 per cent were engaged in either education or employment, so the program works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a national program, it is run locally. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Youth Connections is run by Anglicare ACT, and helps over 1,000 young Canberrans each year. On the eve of Christmas last year, I received a letter from Anglicare ACT expressing extreme concern that the Abbott government was planning to cut funding for Youth Connections from the end of this year. Recently I visited Youth Connections and saw the impressive work they are doing in educating and counselling young Canberrans and making a difference. Today I call on those opposite to go and meet with the Youth Connections operations in your electorates to see firsthand the great work they are doing and to commit to funding the program beyond this year. There is nothing more important for the future of our economy than ensuring our young people—all young people—have access to education, training and work.
