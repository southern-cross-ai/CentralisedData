        The Central West of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        is one of the most vibrant regions of this great country that we proudly call home. While abundant in natural beauty and resources, it's an incredible place to live because of the generations of hardworking residents and strong communities which have had a vision for what they could achieve and dared greatly to make it happen. Region-building projects require the foresight to see beyond what is and picture what could be—region-building projects like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Great Western Highway
        </a>
        upgrade, which would have helped bridge the great divide between city and country by strengthening the road system which connects them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Devastatingly, the federal Labor government has proved time and time again that the vision of an Australia where country areas stand on equal footing with city areas is not one they share. The federal government just axed over $2 billion of funding and walked away from the Great Western Highway upgrade between Katoomba and Lithgow. This repugnant decision stinks of city favouritism. It's robbing the regions. It's a shameless and blatant burgling from the bush. It's spitting in the face of country communities which deserve a Great Western Highway that lives up to its name.
       </p>
       <p>
        The upgrade was more than just a road project; it was an opportunity to finally fix the passage over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Great Dividing Range
        </a>
        , improving road accessibility from country to city and boosting regional transport, health and tourism outcomes. Everyone in western New South Wales has experienced the long and infuriating traffic jams in and out of Sydney.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        termed the project 'a key enabler of regional development'—a strong case to retain this funding, one might be led to believe. Even the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        said so herself earlier this year, telling local media that the funding remained on the table and that the project was 'needed'—hollow assurances for the people of central western New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our communities have been waiting years for a decent road over the mountains, and this latest cut is as disgraceful as it reprehensible for the people west of the Great Dividing Range. The people of our area deserve far better. I have demanded the urgent reversal of this disgraceful cut and also requested an urgent meeting with the minister to explain to me how she will be reversing this outrageous decision. For the past 18 months, the Labor government has looked at our region as though it's a money box from which to pilfer hard-won funding. First, we had the $27.8 million that was sitting in the bank for the Dixons Long Point project snatched away. Then they came for the $12.5 million for the second Bathurst racetrack at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Panorama" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Panorama
        </a>
        /Wahluu, and now we have news that upgrades to the Great Western Highway at Lithgow have been killed off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Axing this project shows that this government does not understand country communities and how important it is to improve key transport links between the city and the bush. This betrayal is a dagger to the hearts of our communities and will not be forgotten. This city-centric funding cut is despicable, and I again call on the minister to reverse it and also to meet with me as I have requested. This outrageous cut is a shameful episode in the history of regional Australia.
