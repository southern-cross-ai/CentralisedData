        health system, run by the Labor administration, is in a critical and unstable condition, despite enormous financial support from the federal government, and has been a staple media headline for months now. The common diagnosis, it seems, is that the Territory is currently plagued by a full-blown raging epidemic. It is not a mutant virus affecting the Territory, though; it is a sick and failing government that must be revived. The fact is, the only reason the hospital system has not totally failed yet is because of the gargantuan efforts of the health professionals who have gone above and beyond their call of duty.

Within weeks of that, he announced that he was giving serious thought to retiring from politics. In June 2005, as part of the Martin Labor government’s election campaign, the health minister promised that another 48 beds would be provided to

By July 2005, we discovered the problem of a growing waiting list for elective surgery, with one patient who required a hip replacement having his surgery deferred six times in the previous 12 months.

Some patients were waiting on trolleys in corridors for up to four days, and some of them did not even get admitted to the wards but instead were treated in the emergency department over several days and then discharged.

In February 2006, a patient with a blockage in his throat was made to wait for nearly a day on a trolley in a corridor to have that blockage removed. In fact, the man was told to drink Coca-Cola to fix his problem.

                  . I make the point again that the only reason I can see that the health system has not failed is through the very hard efforts of the health professionals who are holding the flag of this floundering health system.

                  All of us remember that the Royal Darwin Hospital played a pivotal role in treating large numbers of casualties from the Bali bombings. The work of medical and other staff was magnificent under the direction of Dr Didier Palmer. While the trauma centre is designed to ensure Australia has an effective capacity to receive and treat casualties should there be another terrorist attack or a natural disaster, importantly, though, it will also be used on a day-to-day basis by the people of the

                  . It is worth while here extending my many thanks to the Royal Darwin Hospital general manager Dr Robin Michael, medical superintendent Dr Len Notaras, and Dr Didier Palmer and his colleague Dr Dianne Stephens, who are the joint directors of the emergency department at Royal Darwin Hospital.

                  The lifeline that the federal government has thrown to the Territory government will offer immediate assistance to the

                  health system, reactivating five operating theatres and establishing another 10 beds in the emergency care unit. A close eye will be kept on how the $66 million will be spent. I am advised that there will be big consequences if there is any cost shifting at all by the Martin government in the Northern Territory.

                        that it is not viable. It appears that the minister is oblivious to the 250 patients who have to travel interstate for cancer treatment. These patients have lived in the hope that the Labor government will deliver the oncology unit each year for the last five years but to no avail.

                        and the NT Cancer Council; Michelle Hanton, Breast Cancer Voice and Dragons Abreast; and Martha Swart and the NT Palliative Care Association, just to name a few. I share their spirit for the fight against cancer. I know how important it is for Territorians to have an oncology unit. I am here to tell the parliament that I am fighting hard down here at the moment to see whether the federal government can supply some resources to see this oncology unit become a reality in the Northern Territory.
