       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows on from his answer to a previous question, in which he referred to his so-called truth about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
         AWA
        </a>
        s. Isn’t it the case that under the Serco Sodexho Defence Services AWA at Duntroon someone working a regular 38-hour week from Monday to Friday would be worse off by more than $50 a week, $2,600 a year, or more than $13,000 over the five years of that agreement? Why does the Prime Minister deliberately pretend that working Australians have choice when the only choice is a wage cut—in this case, ending up more than $13,000 worse off? Why does the Prime Minister persist in misleading the Australian people about AWAs?

        <p>
         The track record of accuracy of allegations made by the member for Perth regarding
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         is about one out of 10 since Work Choices was introduced—and that is being charitable. I do not intend to confirm or verify anything. If the member for Perth wants to send me the workplace agreement, I would be very happy to have a look at it. But let me remind the member for Perth that in the last almost six months that this legislation has been in operation every single one of his prophecies of gloom has been disproved. You said there would be mass sackings; there have been mass hirings. You said there would be mass strikes; there has been a record period between industrial disputes. You said wages were going to be cut; wages have continued to grow very strongly in real terms. If the member for Perth wants to get into a debate about which side of politics can better boost the pay packets of Australian workers, we will welcome it very warmly.
