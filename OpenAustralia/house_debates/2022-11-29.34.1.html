       <p>
        I want to draw the attention of the House, as I do each and every year, to the remarkable students in Deakin. Each year we highlight the high achievers, and those going above and beyond for their school community, through the Deakin Shield. Our school students suffered a two-year pandemic, and, as a result, it has left many of them more self-sufficient and independent than ever.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deakin Shield recognises the valuable contribution of students from schools throughout the electorate of Deakin. Students are recognised by their schools and their teachers for a high standard in attitude and achievement, participation in all school activities with a good attitude, a full commitment to the ethos of the school, an awareness of others and their needs, and a positive contribution to the school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nearly all the schools within the Deakin electorate have participated in the Deakin Shield over the past 10 years, with staff selecting the successful students. The categories of winners are diverse. They include academic achievement, community service, school spirit, sporting achievement and musical achievement, to name just a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we commence awarding the 2022 Deakin Shield awards to students, can I congratulate, in advance, all of the winners, their families and their schools for this exceptional achievement. I wish all of our schools and their students the best of luck in the run-up to Christmas.
