       <p>
        I rise tonight to congratulate Dr Les Sands, who has just written a book called
        <i>
         The Continuing History of Ipswich Baptist
        </i>
        . It builds on the work of Reverend John White, who wrote a history of Ipswich Baptist Church. For 150 years Ipswich Baptist Church has operated in the middle of Ipswich, and it is a church of which I happen to be a proud member. I married the pastor’s daughter many years ago, so I have to behave and am a member of that particular congregation! It has a great social ministry. It is strong in young people, strong in the women’s ministry and also strong in helping the marginalised.
       </p>
       <p>
        The church has always helped in the area of homelessness and currently employs someone who operates 241 Ministries, which operates in the middle of Ipswich caring for those who are homeless, with disability or with alcohol or drug addictions. It has been very strong when it comes to caring for the poor, the weak and the marginalised. This particular ministry is a wonderful ministry. It has been picked up by Les Sands, and I thank Les for the great work he has done. He serves as the church secretary and deacon. I have known him for many years and I want to thank him for the kind words he said about me and my family in the book. I want to say to Ipswich Baptist Church: congratulations for 150 years of faithful ministry, faithful mission and faithful care of the people of Ipswich, particularly those who are poor, those with disability and those who are weak and oppressed.
