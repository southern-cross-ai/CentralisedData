        I present the report from the Committee of Privileges and Members’ Interests concerning an application from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_David_Flint" rel="nofollow">
         Professor David Flint
        </a>
        for the publication of a response to a reference made in the House of Representatives, and I ask leave of the House to move that the report be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the report be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report I have presented relates to a request from Professor David Flint for a right of reply in relation to references to him made by the now Minister for Finance and Deregulation in the House on 13 February 2006. The committee has considered Professor Flint’s submission and has recommended that a response in the terms included in the report I have just presented be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . In recommending the response be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , the committee emphasises that, as required by the right of reply resolution, it has not considered or judged the truth of any statements made by the member in the House or by the person seeking a response.

        The document read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 13 February 2006, Mr Lindsay Tanner MP, the Member for Melbourne, alleged that Australian’s for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Monarchy" rel="nofollow">
         Constitutional Monarchy
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM" rel="nofollow">
         ACM
        </a>
        ) had “engaged in a brazen tax scam” and that the association between ACM and the Constitution Education Fund Australia (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEF" rel="nofollow">
         CEF
        </a>
        -A) was a “fraud on Australian taxpayers”. He offered no evidence nor had he contacted either ACM or CEF-A beforehand. However he urged ACM “to make use of their right of reply in parliament” to provide an explanation of the circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In referring to me as the national convenor of ACM, there was an implication that the allegations
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Tanner" rel="nofollow">

        made applied to me in a way that adversely affected my reputation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Taxation Office (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        ) conducted a comprehensive and lengthy audit of CEF-A, and substantial costs were involved in satisfying the requests of the ATO. The audit resulted in no finding of any breach of the tax laws. Although requested, Mr Tanner has not withdrawn his allegation.
