       <p>
        I raise a matter that should be of serious concern to all members today. Australia is facing a growing public health burden due to asbestos related diseases. In the past, Australians were heavy users of asbestos—particularly building products for commercial, rural and domestic premises. In the 1950s housing boom, thousands and thousands of homes were built using asbestos cement sheets. Many members have no doubt encountered an asbestos product, given that it was used in around 3,000 different items until 1982.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although asbestos is no longer used, no Australian is immune from the dangers of asbestos. In the last 50 years, hundreds of thousands of Australians have unknowingly been exposed to asbestos products in their homes and at work, whether they be asbestos miners; workers in asbestos industries; men and women serving in the armed forces; workers in government owned industries such as hospitals, schools and power stations; mums washing clothes covered in asbestos fibres; or dads cutting fibro sheets in the backyard where kids play. None of them knew of the dangers that confronted them or, if they did, they underestimated the reach of asbestos related diseases. There is now a wave of cases of asbestos related diseases appearing among a new generation of home renovators. In my electorate of Lowe, where old federation and California bungalow homes abound, there are many homes that have some asbestos in them.
       </p>
       <p>
        It may take one asbestos fibre to cause an asbestos related disease decades after initial exposure, and the risk is cumulative—that is, the longer the exposure to asbestos particles, the greater the risk of developing an asbestos related disease in the future. The most aggressive asbestos related disease is malignant pleural mesothelioma, for which there is no cure. Predictive modelling suggests the incidence of new mesothelioma cases will increase and not peak until 2020. This is a most frightening thought, particularly when the risk of contracting the disease is entirely preventable through awareness and education.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prognosis for mesothelioma is poor. The average life expectancy from diagnosis to death is 152 days. Treatment options are limited. However, recent studies have provided evidence that the chemotherapy agent Alimta can inhibit the tumour growth and increase life expectancy. Given how precious each day is to mesothelioma patients and their families, this is surely a drug that should be made available to them. However, the drug costs $18,000, putting it out of the reach of many families. Many people who fall prey to this insidious disease through absolutely no fault of their own deserve our compassion and, more importantly, our support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will not be able to go into detail about the benefits of Alimta in the very short time available to me today, but I will seek to do so when the opportunity arises in the House next week. However, given the urgent nature of the problems that face us, I have already asked the Minister for

        for use by those with mesothelioma. I appreciate that the minister has a busy schedule; however, I trust an answer will be forthcoming as soon as possible.
