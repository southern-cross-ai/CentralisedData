        Just a few short weeks ago the COSBOA annual summit was held. There were some magnificent presentations. Probably the pinnacle was

        from News.com. He provided a very eloquent contribution to that summit, but what will stick in people's minds is what the Treasurer had to say. In his address he told the gathered audience that the carbon tax would be great news for retailers.
