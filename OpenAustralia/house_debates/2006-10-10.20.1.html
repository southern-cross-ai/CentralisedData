        My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister advise the House how the government’s ongoing commitment to pursue wider trade markets is benefiting Australia’s exporters?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to report to the House that last month Australia’s exports totalled something over $18 billion—the second highest figure on record. It is particularly pleasing to note the strong growth in our export performance. As a result, our trade deficit was just $208 million for the month—down $112 million on the previous month.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most impressive and pleasing aspect of our export reforms in the month is that, despite the claims of the opposition that our export performance was faltering and was only being held up as a result of the commodities boom, the facts show that these claims are completely false. In reality, commodity exports for the month were flat—actually down slightly at $6.1 billion. The real growth that occurred was in other areas, such as the manufacturing sector, which the Labor Party always says is in crisis. It in fact had an increase to $3.7 billion. The service sector also produced $3.7 billion worth of exports. It is also pleasing to note that the figures for education have been significantly upgraded. Again, Labor says that our policies are failing, but the reality is that education is on the verge of becoming a $10 billion a year export industry. That is a significantly important employer and provides an opportunity for Australia to spread our export industry around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         So the reality is that there has been a substantial growth in our manufactured exports, our service exports and in education. I am sure the honourable member for Wakefield, in particular, would be pleased to note the substantial increase in car exports in the previous month—up 37 per cent in a month. There was a 37 per cent increase in car exports and over 60,000 vehicles will be exported this financial year. In 2005-06 car exports reached a record $5.2 billion. So our manufacturers, our service sectors and our educators are getting on with the job of exports and helping to improve Australia’s trading situation.
