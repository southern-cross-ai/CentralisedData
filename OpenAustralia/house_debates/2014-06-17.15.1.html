        Since being elected as the member for Lindsay I have had the pleasure of visiting almost all the 65 local schools. As the fourth youngest electorate in the country we have dynamic primary and secondary schools and our education leaders are dedicated to raising the future leaders of our community. Our schools and our teaching communities are extremely passionate about the local region and are also actively engaged in the development and creation of opportunities for the next generation. I would like to recognise all the teaching staff and principals across the electorate who all do such a fabulous job. The quality of our local teachers was recognised this month when

        principal Kay Rigas was awarded one of four Harvard Club of Australia education scholarships. The $10,000 scholarship is for a 2Â½ week course based on evolving leadership. Upon receiving the scholarship, Kay said: 'I might be the one going over to Cambridge, but in my opinion I am taking the school with me. My staff and students are my inspiration, and I truly feel that this course will enable me to continue to be innovative in learning and to come back inspired.' This sentiment of winning not for one individual but for the community and for the school community is representative of the spirit of all my local schools. I congratulate Kay on being awarded this prestigious scholarship and look forward to catching up with her on her return.
