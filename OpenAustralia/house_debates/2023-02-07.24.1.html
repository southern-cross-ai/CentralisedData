        On 23 November, the world lost one of our greats. Betty Fisher left an indelible mark on the world and the people around her for her unwavering dedication to a better and more just society.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the honour to know Betty. Betty was a committed Labor woman. She was a committed trade unionist and she proclaimed herself to be a socialist. She joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        in the early seventies and was later made a life member of the party. She was a friend of and an advocate for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people. She was a staunch environmentalist. In fact, she became the first female president of the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, Betty was a feminist who advocated for and supported women in all walks of life, including politics. My good friend in South Australia, former

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Key" rel="nofollow">

        , was very close to Betty. It was a friendship that endured to the end. I know that Steph, as well as all of Betty's friends and family, feels Betty's loss immensely.
       </p>
       <p>
        For all we have lost with Betty's passing, we have gained so much more from her life. We are a better and kinder society thanks to Betty's care for the welfare of others and her community work, and we're a stronger society thanks to her unwavering advocacy and her ability to speak for those who could not. From me, thank you, Betty, for all you have given us and all the advice you gave me over the years.
