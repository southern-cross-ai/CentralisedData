       <p>
        On 15 May, I was fortunate to join members of the Pagewood Botany Football Club family to pay tribute to a legend of football in the eastern suburbs, George Lundy, who passed away last year. George was the heart and soul of the Pagewood Botany Football Club. Instrumental in the club's establishment in 1976, he was an inaugural player who went on to be a coach of junior teams for many years, a long-term president of the club and a life member.
       </p>
       <p>
        George loved football and was passionate about getting kids of all abilities involved in community sport. Under George's leadership, the Pagewood Botany Football Club formed a close relationship with the Windgap Foundation, supporting people with disabilities in our community. George was a mentor to the Windgap Warriors football team and helped organise the annual game between the Warriors and the Pagewood old boys. He fundraised to establish the Bayside Women's Shelter and many other charities in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        George was at the home ground at Jellicoe Park every weekend and, with a boisterous Belfast accent, could be heard from the other side of the park. He would get around and speak to every player, coach and parent, always with his lovely wife, Kathleen, by his side. In a fitting tribute, the fields at Jellicoe Park have been named George Lundy Sporting Fields in honour of this great man and his contribution to football in our community. May he rest in peace. I offer my condolences to Kathleen, Gerard, Stephen and Nicele and their families.
