         Charles Best

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) insulin was first administered to a 14 year old boy,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Leonard Thompson

        (2) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) diabetes is a serious and complex metabolic disease that affects the lives of many Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        (3) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has a long-standing commitment to the NDSS, established in 1987, which assists people with diabetes to self-manage their diabetes through provision of subsidised insulin pen needles and pump consumables, glucose monitoring strips, continuous glucose monitors and flash monitors, and important information, resources, education and support programs and other services;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) there has been strong bi-partisan support for the NDSS; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) since its inception the NDSS supports all people with diabetes all over Australia, including children with type 1 diabetes and families, young adults, women with diabetes in pregnancy and over 450,000 people who currently use insulin to help manage their diabetes.

       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government's $270 billion investment in Australia's defence capability is creating thousands of jobs and opportunities for small businesses across Australia, particularly in the state of

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) a key pillar of our economic recovery plan to get Australians in jobs is getting more Australian businesses in our defence industry to deliver the essential capability our Defence Force relies on; and

       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that because of the support measures the Government has introduced to help Australian defence:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) businesses remain in business and are recovering from COVID-19; and
