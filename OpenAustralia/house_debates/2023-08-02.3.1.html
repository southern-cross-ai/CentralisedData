        (2) acknowledges the Government's commitment to an ambitious housing agenda which will boost the supply of all housing, with more social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy, and includes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) establishing the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee three months early, helping regional Australians purchase a home with as little as a 5 per cent deposit and avoiding paying Lenders' Mortgage Insurance;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) widening the remit of the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, making up to $575 million available to invest immediately in social and affordable rental homes, with projects already under construction as a result of this funding;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) working with the states and territories through the National Housing Accord and National Cabinet to support planning and zoning reforms to contribute to the aspiration of building one million new homes over 5 years from 2024, as well as investing $350 million in additional federal funding to deliver 10,000 affordable rental homes over five years from 2024 as part of the accordâ€”matched by the states and territories;

       <p class="italic">
        (d) further establishing the interim National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to provide expert advice to Government on housing supply and affordability;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) increasing the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation's liability cap by $2 billion to provide lower cost and longer-term finance to community housing providers through the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator;

       <p class="italic">
        (h) further providing an additional $67.5 million of funding to the states and territories to help tackle homelessness challenges as part of a one-year extension to the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement which provides $1.7 billion a year to the states and territories for housing and homelessness services; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) expanding eligibility for the Home Guarantee Scheme, which helps people purchase a home sooner by reducing the deposit they need to save; and

       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that the Government has committed to funding $3.4 billion of the $7 billion Olympics infrastructure, in the middle of a cost living crisis, when it refuses to invest more than $500 million a year in social and affordable housing;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that the average cost blow-out of an Olympics since 1960 is 2.5 times the original cost, which would see the cost of the Brisbane Olympics blow-out to $17.5 billion; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the recent decision by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Government
        </a>
        to cancel the

        (2) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) drop its support for the disastrous Gabba demolition and rebuild that will see the bulldozing of a local public school, East Brisbane State School, and

         Raymond Park

        , a much loved public park;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) re-negotiate a new Olympics infrastructure agreement that actually prioritises using existing infrastructure, like

         Carrara Stadium

        (c) commit that any infrastructure built for the Olympics remains in public hands, including retaining the athletes' village as publicly-owned housing.

        (b) estimated First Nations enrolment has increased in every state and territory to the highest it has ever been so that:

        (i) nationwide it is now at 94.1 per cent, up from 84.5 per cent just six months ago; and

        (d) a sustainable native hardwood timber industry is part of the answer to reducing Australia's carbon emissions as timber products sequester carbon in our floorboards, furniture and other timber products;

        (2) notes that the Victorian Government's illogical decision to ban all native hardwood timber harvesting on public land from 1 January 2024 is based on political science, not environmental science; and

        (3) urges the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) recognise the sustainable native hardwood timber industry is an issue of national importance because of supply chain considerations and community safety;
