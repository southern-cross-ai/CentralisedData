       <p>
        Earlier this month Oceania Oncology announced it would be opening a second radiotherapy centre in my electorate of Hinkler. From December this year, cancer patients will be able to receive treatment locally in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Hervey Bay
        </a>
        . The centre will be the first of its kind in Hervey Bay and is expected to treat about 500 patients a year. Oceania Oncology's presence will significantly reduce the inconvenience and cost for local patients, who previously had to travel hundreds of kilometres to Nambour or Brisbane to receive this treatment. Radiotherapy treatments can take between two and seven weeks, so having these services available locally will ease some of the burden on patients and their loved ones during a challenging time.
       </p>
       <p>
        About 1,400 people are diagnosed with cancer in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Coast
        </a>
        region every year. The centre will be integrated with Oceania's existing centre in Bundaberg, which health minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        and I officially opened in late January. The $11.3 million oncology centre in Bundaberg currently treats about 25 patients a day. It has six chemotherapy chairs, two radiotherapy treatment bunkers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        scanning, ultrasound and digital X-ray services.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the construction of the new facility in Hervey Bay, at the southern end of my electorate, Oceania will provide complimentary transport to the Bundaberg centre from Hervey Bay and Maryborough. Both centres use state-of-the-art technology to ensure patients receive world-class treatment, and are located in close proximity to other health services and facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to offer Oceania Oncology my sincerest thanks for their commitment to the people of Hinkler, and for their patience while awaiting the necessary approvals. Their dedication and persistence is admirable.
