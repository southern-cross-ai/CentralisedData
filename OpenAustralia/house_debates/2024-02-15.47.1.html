       <p>
        As every member in this chamber knows, the Albanese Labor government is helping to ease the cost of living for thousands of Australians living on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . From 1 July this year, our Labor government will give every Australian taxpayer a tax cut. We want people living and working on the Central Coast to earn more and keep more of what they earn. This will see 66,000 taxpayers in Robertson receive a tax cut equivalent to $1,580 on average across the electorate. This is cost-of-living relief that will make a huge difference to thousands of individuals, couples and families across the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are a nurse working at either Wyong or Gosford hospital and on a yearly salary of $75,000, you will receive a tax cut of over $1,500; if you're a teacher at Umina Beach Public School or Woodport Public School in Erina on a salary of $80,000, you will receive a tax cut of over $1,600; and, if you're a tradie in Kincumber or Kariong earning $110,000 a year, you'll get a tax cut of over $2,400 a year. Eighty-five per cent of taxpayers in Robertson will now be better off under the Labor tax cuts than they would have been under the Morrison legislated tax cuts. Our economic plan delivers tax cuts that benefit more Australians, and we are doing it in a way that is fair and responsible, because we have a vision—one of economic stability and progress where every Australian benefits—unlike that Liberal-National coalition of no, who will consistently let you down.
