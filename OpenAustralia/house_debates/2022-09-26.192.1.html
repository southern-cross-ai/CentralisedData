       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge the wonderful life of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnston" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Johnston
        </a>
        , who, sadly, recently passed away. Born in Lismore, Robert was well known in the working-dog community. He won multiple titles at local, state and national levels. At the State of Origin Dog Trial he had the top dog for 13 years and won the Australian Working Dog Championship three times. He left school at 15 and worked full time with his father, droving and working dogs. He learnt from a young age how to work his dogs and would do this by horseback. At an older age, he switched to quad bikes.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was always learning, looking for better ways to develop his craft. He sold his pups, which were highly valued, not just in Australia but around the world. He also set up a training arena at his Tatham property, where people would attend to get their dogs trained by him. Bus tours also visited the property to witness him training his dogs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert's funeral service was held at Casino, where over 500 people attended to farewell him. Also in attendance, very importantly, were his 10 working dogs. I extend my thoughts and prayers to his wife, Narelle. Robert had three children, Kim and her husband, Rick; Elissa and her husband, Danny; and Robbie and his wife, Shan. He had seven grandchildren: Taylor, Grace, Mytch, Jack, Harry, Clay and Kirra. May he rest in peace.
