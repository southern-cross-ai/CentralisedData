        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. In my home state of Tasmania in 2023, 81.1 per cent of vehicle sales were either
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV" rel="nofollow">
         SUV
        </a>
        s, light commercial vehicles or utes. The top selling cars were the HiLux,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranger" rel="nofollow">
         Ford Ranger
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">
         MG
        </a>
        MG3. Industry analysis shows that they would attract penalties of $14,000, $17,000 and $11,000, respectively. Why does this Labor government continue to punish Aussie families and tradies in the bush where they're trying to earn a living?

        <p>
         Again, it appears that I appreciate the question more than the honourable member appreciates being asked to ask it. Perhaps the honourable member is a little bit embarrassed about opposing a policy which would save his constituents $1,009 a year in petrol costs by giving them a choice of better cars in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, the honourable member in the question that was written for him, has mischaracterised, of course, the policy design that has been put forward and consulted upon by the minister for transport and I. I'm a little surprised the question got through tactics because the chair of the tactics committee is the member for Bradfield. The House will be shocked to learn that he has views about this matter and about the availability of utes in countries with fuel efficiency standards. He pointed out, for example:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         So when fuel efficiency standards were introduced in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , the most popular models before introduction stayed the most popular models after introduction. Essentially, what Americans call pickup trucks and what we'd call utes, like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Silverado" rel="nofollow">
          Chevy Silverado
         </a>
         . There wasn't a material change in price and we don't expect that there would be a material change in price here.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the honourable member and those opposite are seeking to convince the Australian people of is that Australia will be the only country in the world where we introduce efficiency standards and the price of vehicles go up as a result. It didn't happen in the United States in 1975, Japan in 1985, China in 2005,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          South Korea

         in 2006, the European Union in 2009, Canada in 2011, Mexico in 2013, India in 2014, or, I think the Prime Minister's personal favourite,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">

         in 2016. Those woke warriors at it again! That is why, for example, Hyundai has said:

        <p class="italic">
         We think we will soon have a world-class Efficiency Standard in Australia and we're excited by that.

                       To be very clear, there is no additional commentary that has been included. I read directly from the question asked by the honourable member. There was no additional information introduced, so to characterise it in that way is to misrepresent the point of order that we made. If your point is that you're going to rule that additional points of order can't be made on the basis that I've made them today, then, with respect, that is outside of the standing orders. The point I made was to quote directly from the question from the honourable member. That is completely and absolutely in order.

                        The Leader of the Opposition has the right to raise a point of order. I want to be clear that the minister does not have to answer each aspect of the question to be relevant, and he's not obliged to answer every part of the question, as has been the ruling from Speaker Smith, Speaker Jenkins and Speaker Bishop, which I have in front of me. It is important, going forward, that the minister is being relevant, but he doesn't need to answer exactly every aspect of the question. You're entitled to raise the point of order. We agree on that. The minister is answering the question and is being directly relevant. You may not like the answer—I appreciate that—and it may not be the answer the member—

                           I haven't—and, as the standing orders state and is reps practice, what is an unparliamentary remark is not political sensitivities, which is what we're getting from that side. But I'm happy to withdraw if it helps you in the House.

                             There are some of us who know that what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is untrue. It is not just the member for Bradfield.

                            <p>
                             I will finish with some support for the member for Bradfield from Senator Sharma, who said on 5 February:
                            </p>

                             Well, we are adopting increasing fuel efficiency standards and that's a good thing. I don't have a problem with that. We should be doing that, and the fleet should be progressively getting cleaner and a lower intensity of emissions.
