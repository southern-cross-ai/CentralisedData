        It is with pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge the wonderful work of one of the sporting clubs in my electorate of Bonner, the Manly Dragon Boat Club. Previously it was in the member for Griffith's electorate, and I acknowledge him in the chamber today. I would like to pay tribute to those who have put so much time and effort into this club, enabling it to achieve such a profound level of success on the world stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Manly Dragon Boat Club competed at the 8th Club Crew World Championships conducted on

        </a>
        in the first week of July this year and was extremely successful in their first ever attempt at international competition. Manly entered into eight separate events, reaching the finals in all the events they entered into, and winning medals in six of them. This amazing achievement was capped off by the master women's 10's crew team who, in the 500 metres category, took gold, becoming world champions!
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to take this time to acknowledge the achievements of this amazing club, led by president Jason Ferrari, vice president Lisa Watzek, treasurer Fran White, secretary Danielle Ferrari, development officer Ross Boyce, membership officer Alex Mayes and club coach Maggie Boyce. For a club that was established only five years ago, with only 15 members, without the benefit of experienced paddlers, coaches or equipment, they have shown remarkable determination and commitment to develop a community based not-for-profit club for people of all ages. It is this drive that has led to the club's phenomenal success at a worldwide level.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club now boasts well over 100 members, with many new memberships starting up following their wonderful success on the world stage. I look forward to watching this magnificent community sporting club continue to grow from strength to strength. I am incredibly proud to acknowledge the achievements of the Manly Dragon Boat Club, who have put the wonderful suburb of the Manly community on the world map. I am delighted to have such a talented and driven group of individuals as part of my electorate of Bonner, and it is only fitting that they receive acknowledgement for their outstanding success.
