        I wish to inform the parliament of a strategic new road project which will improve transport links for the Moore electorate: the Whiteman Yanchep Highway. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        at its December 2017 council meeting resolved to advise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Roads_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Main Roads Western Australia
        </a>
        that the city supports the proposed alignment of the Whiteman Yanchep Highway, Gnangara Road to Neaves Road, and the proposed alignment of Neaves Road to Flynn Drive. The city also supports Main Roads making an application to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Planning_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian Planning Commission
        </a>
        to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Region_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Metropolitan Region Scheme
        </a>
        and endorses these respective road alignments. These projects will further improve road connectivity between the cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo and the electorate of Moore. Connecting the Moore electorate to key residential, commercial and employment areas and transport routes is essential to providing greater amenity for residents and opportunities for capital growth. Since 2013 the federal government has extended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Freeway
        </a>
        north to Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue. Connectivity has been further improved by creating additional capacity on key arterial roads by investing $50 million in a new grade-separated traffic interchange bridge over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joondalup_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Joondalup Drive
        </a>
        intersection and $65 million in a similar traffic flyover bridge over Wanneroo Road at the intersection with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        . These measures will improve east-west traffic linkages, complementing key transport routes such as NorthLink and connecting with industrial areas to the east such as Wangara and Malaga as well as population centres such as Ellenbrook. In addition, a further $31 million has been invested in the widening of Wanneroo Road to a dual carriageway between Joondalup Drive and Flynn Drive to service the Neerabup industrial area, with construction works nearing completion.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also plans in progress to extend the Mitchell Freeway to Romeo Road and subsequently connect the Mitchell Freeway to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean Drive
        </a>
        by 2050. Meanwhile $23 million has been invested in widening
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmion_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Marmion Avenue
        </a>
        to a dual carriageway all the way to Yanchep, directly connecting Moore with the northern coastal suburbs. The federal Liberal government has a strong plan to connect Moore to key residential, commercial and employment areas and transport corridors to promote local economic development, create employment and provide greater amenity for local residents through investment in key road infrastructure.
