        I rise to express my concern with regard to the areas for further assessment announced recently by Minister Garrett. Communities from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Hat Head
        </a>
        to Brooms Head in my electorate could be decimated if this assessment process is poorly conducted. Sadly, this government has a very poor record when it comes to the implementation of programs and program delivery.

        Coastal communities are very concerned for their future. They are very concerned about a future that may largely exclude fishing. The management of Commonwealth waters needs to be done in a way which balances the needs of environmental sustainability with the needs of economic sustainability. That is why I have launched a petition. We have seen an overwhelming response to that petition, with over 3,000 signatures already collected. The petition calls on this House to take into account the economic needs of communities as well as the need for an excellent environment. I have certainly had a great response to it. The petition was launched at the South West Rocks Country Club and at the Coffs Harbour Deep Sea Fishing Club. We have also had another launch in Maclean.

        Both fish co-ops and recreational fishers are greatly concerned at the potential that their livelihoods may be decimated. Also, the owners of accommodation fear that the loss of fishing may mean the loss of future potential tenants. In many small communities, tourists come to fish. The decimation of the ability to fish could mean the economic decimation of many small communities.
