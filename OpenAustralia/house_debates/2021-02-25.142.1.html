        Now, more than ever, it's essential that different levels of government cooperate and work closely together to help drive Australia's economic recovery following the pandemic. So it's been very pleasing to work so closely with

        and the lord mayor on some key local projects that will be delivered by federal funding through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. In total, more than $40 million of federally supported infrastructure projects will soon be underway in Brisbane. These are a variety of shovel-ready projects that will make our local area better in so many ways—enhancing green space, safety and improving the Brisbane lifestyle we love so much. This is federal economic support being delivered at a local community level, which will support an additional 320 local jobs through 2021.

        One example is that the residents of Windsor will benefit from a brand-new playground at the new Windsor Sports and

        . In Hamilton, the refurbishment of the town hall will significantly improve the facilities that are available for local community groups. In Paddington, the old substation building will benefit from $1½ million in repairs and refurbishments, to improve the heritage conditions on the terraces and to make it fit for many of the local community groups that use it, like Hands On Art.

        At Brekkie Creek, lighting and greening upgrades will improve the green space amenity and safety. Plus, about 60 local sporting clubs and groups across Brisbane will benefit from a sports field lighting upgrade program. There are major road maintenance projects, as well as pavement resurfacing and the maintenance of major retaining walls, across so many locations in the city. Further funds will be invested in a bushland acquisition program. This is about securing land that supports native wildlife, flora and ecosystems, creating more conservation reserves across Brisbane to ensure everyone can continue to enjoy our natural environment.
       </p>

        Another highlight is funding for wildlife corridors and safety infrastructure. We're talking about $700,000 worth of investments across Brisbane for things like glider and possum poles, underpass ledges and fauna movement infrastructure, installed in so many places across our great city. That both helps with wildlife conservation and improves driver safety.

        I should also mention today's big announcement about Brisbane being the preferred location for the 2032 Olympics. This is one more very strong example of all levels of government working collaboratively together to get amazing results, and good results as well as we look at the recovery after 2020. What's more, this provides further opportunities in coming years for all levels of government to continue to collaborate, to keep working together, to ensure our region in South-East Queensland has the best infrastructure it possibly can.
