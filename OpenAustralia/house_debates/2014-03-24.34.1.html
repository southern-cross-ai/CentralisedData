       <p>
        I recently had the great pleasure of visiting the junior and senior campuses of Melba College in Croydon to present badges and certificates to this year's cohort of student leaders. Since the start of the school year I have had the honour of visiting many schools throughout my electorate of Deakin to recognise student leaders. I really love nothing more than meeting the bright young people who are helping their peers to get the most out of their school years, which are for many the best years of their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to particularly acknowledge the student leaders at Melba College because they have gone through a big transition. Their school is a new one, formed recently out of a merger of two other colleges. Under the excellent stewardship of Principal Terry Bennett, the students I met with showed a strong commitment to creating a positive and productive culture at their new school. They shared with me their belief in the importance of leading by example, as well as the excellent ideas they had for uniting the student body, building the new school's reputation and making it a place where every student could reach their full potential. I congratulate the 2014 student leaders at all of the schools in my electorate of Deakin, including the students at Melba College.
