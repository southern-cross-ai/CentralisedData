        I wish to speak on the latest developments in the case of missing

        and the incredible courage and strength of his parents, Denise and Bruce. Daniel's disappearance and believed murder has become a story of national and international focus. Most of the nation knows of his parents, who have demonstrated amazing tenacity since his disappearance in December 2003. They have never let the case go cold and they continually campaign to ensure that it has never been far from the thoughts of people across Australia. Their tenacity has paid off. The most recent developments in the case have been well publicised. A 41-year-old man was charged over the matter and faced court on 15 August. He is charged with murder, deprivation of liberty, child stealing, indecent treatment of a child under 16 and interfering with a corpse. I phoned Denise Morcombe soon after the news to offer my prayers, condolences and good wishes and to wish the Morcombes strength during the next phase of a case that will again test their strength. The former Prime Minister and current Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith, contacted me soon after the news of the arrest and asked me to pass on to the Morcombes the sympathy and support of him and his wife, Therese, and I did that. A search has subsequently been conducted by

        </a>
        volunteers and police of a specific area of bushland not far from Beerwah in my electorate, and the search has located some shoes of a type worn by Daniel when he disappeared and also human bones, which are now being tested to determine if they do in fact belong to Daniel.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Daniel's disappearance, Denise and Bruce launched the Daniel Morcombe Foundation as a vehicle to promote the child safety message and also highlight the ongoing investigation into their son's disappearance. These latest developments do not diminish the importance of the child safety message, and I applaud Bruce and Denise for the way they have worked since Daniel's disappearance to help ensure that other families do not experience the tragedy and loss that they have.

        This year I am again encouraging all members and senators in the Australian parliament, and also members of other parliaments around Australia and across the Tasman, to help commemorate the Day for Daniel, which this year will be held on 3 November in the Australian parliament.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day" rel="nofollow">
         The Day
        </a>
        for Daniel is usually held on 28 October, but that is not a parliamentary sitting day, so after consultation with Bruce and Denise Morcombe the Day for Daniel in the Australian parliament will be held on 3 November. On the Sunshine Coast the Day for Daniel includes considerable events to highlight the cause, and I encourage all honourable members this year to participate in the Day for Daniel. Last year it was very successful, with the involvement of the Prime Minister; the Leader of the Opposition; you, Mr Speaker; the Treasurer; the Leader of the House; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; the Manager of Opposition Business; and many others. They wore either a black scarf or an item of red clothing. I will be contacting all members and senators shortly to ask them to put this event in their diaries and to remember to wear an item of red on that day to support this important cause. Members who would like to acquire scarves or ties can do so through my office and, by doing so, make a donation to the important work of the Daniel Morcombe Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bruce and Denise have experienced the most terrible loss that any parent could experience. As a parent myself I have some understanding, although no-one can have a complete understanding of what they have gone through during the many years which have elapsed since 2003. I do, however, see them as role models and icons in our society because of the way that they have gone out of their way to ensure that other families do not experience similar loss. They are wonderful Australians and I applaud them.
