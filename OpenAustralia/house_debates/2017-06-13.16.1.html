       <p>
        The clock is ticking down until 700,000 of our lowest paid workers have their penalty rates cut. It was a decision made by Fair Work. Fair Work decided to cut the Sunday and public holiday penalty rates for some of our lowest paid workers—workers in retail, workers in hospitality and workers in the pharmacy industry. Predominantly, it is women who are working in these industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, there is a chance for the government—the members opposite—to cross the floor and join with Labor to stop this cut. This decision by Fair Work was wrong. It is this place in this parliament that sets the rules around fair work, so there is an opportunity for those opposite, after the matter of public importance, to join with Labor, to cross the floor and to bring on the debate so we can have the discussion about how to protect people's penalty rates and their take-home pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on the member for Dawson, the member for Capricornia, the member for Page, the member for Gilmore and the member for Dunkley to cross the floor and to vote with Labor to bring on this debate so we can protect penalty rates. We can call on Fair Work and we can reset the laws to protect people's take-home pay. I call on the crossbenchers to join with Labor. The clock is ticking, but there is still a chance for this place to do something for our lowest paid workers—people who are about to have a cut in their take-home pay. I urge those opposite to do the right thing.
