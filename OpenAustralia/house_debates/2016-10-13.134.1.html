        On 21 September this year, one of the world's newest and smallest nations celebrated its 25th year of independence. There are few nations that deserve to celebrate such an occasion more than Armenia. Armenia's capital is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. It recently celebrated its 2,798th anniversary and Armenia was the first Christian kingdom in the world. However, independence did not come easily. Armenians have been subject to genocide, and the first democratic republic of Armenia was formed in 1918 but lasted less than three years. Seventy years ago, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Red Army
        </a>
        marched in and Armenia fell to communist rule. However, under Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika, Armenians were able to once again voice their desire for independence and freedom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, on 21 September 1991, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Armenia" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Armenia
        </a>
        was established. Armenia was one of the first countries of the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Soviet Union
        </a>
        to declare independence. As you would expect of a nation of people who fought so long for their independence, Armenia has made significant strides especially in technology, agriculture and the arts. Armenian's ecommerce activity is accelerating. The innovative start-up hub for technology and app development has been so successful that Armenians have their own version of the iPad and iPhone called the ArmPhone and ArmTab.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Armenia's contribution has been far more global. Throughout the world, their diaspora make significant contributions including here in Australia. In this parliament, we are honoured to have the member for Goldstein as an embodiment of that outstanding contribution. On the northern beaches, the Armenian community established a college to promote and preserve their culture and indomitable spirit. Galstaun College was recently recognised by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority as having demonstrated substantially above-average gains in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        results. As Galstaun College's principal, Mr Edward Demirdjian, pointed out, the college was one of only six schools in the state to achieve significant gains. The core ideals of the college are empathy, understanding and respect. No doubt the importance of these ideals are born out of the trials and tribulations of the Armenians' long journey to independence. The college was living these ideals when it accepted 33 family sponsored children of Syrian refugees. The college provides
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        classes, books and uniforms without cost to the families of the children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Armenian community is rightly proud of its independence but should be even prouder of the contribution that its community provides all over the world in places like Galstaun College, which is setting an example for all of us to aspire to.
