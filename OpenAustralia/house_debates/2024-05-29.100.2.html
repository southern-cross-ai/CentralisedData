        Mr Speaker, I have a question for you under standing order 103. Yesterday in Senate estimates the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services stated that he disclosed a conflict of interest to the Parliamentary Service Commissioner in relation to a relationship he had with a direct report but that he did not have a romantic relationship with her at that time. According to his evidence, almost a year later he disclosed the conflict of interest to you and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        when there was a romantic relationship. Can you confirm that the conversation with the secretary and the President was the first you were made aware of the conflict? Do you believe that the declaration of a conflict of interest was made to you in a timely manner, given that it was made almost a year after it was raised with the Parliamentary Service Commissioner?
       </p>

         I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. The secretary raised a conflict with me as part of his declarations. Two days later I met with the secretary for further investigation, and I understand these questions were raised at Senate estimates yesterday. I can advise the House that both the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          President of the Senate
         </a>
         and myself have sought advice from the Australian Public Service Commissioner on the matters the member has raised, and the commissioner was satisfied and gave advice to us that all processes were followed.
