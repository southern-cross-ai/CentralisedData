        Today begins 16 days of activism against gender based violence with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        for the Elimination of Violence against Women, culminating on 10 December with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights Day
        </a>
        . It is clear the effort to end violence against women sadly never ceases, and the responsibility rests with all of usâ€”each and every level of government, our communities and businesses. The government can and must make it easier for women to escape violent and abusive relationships, improve the social security systems and provide more safe places for women and children to stay. We call on the government to do the right thing and introduce paid domestic violence leave in the National Employment Standards, something that hasn't so far happened but should happen.

        I want to take this opportunity today to acknowledge the fantastic work done by so many fantastic organisations in my electorate but, in particular, the Illawarra Women's Health Centre, which does important work to help women escape and recover from domestic violence. I was very pleased in the election campaign to get a commitment to support the extension for their program for women and children escaping domestic and family violence. It is very important work they do. While the government during the election campaign didn't match that funding, I do call on them to look at this very important proposal to see if they have the opportunity to also support it.
