        I recently had the pleasure of attending an award ceremony here at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        to see a small group of science students chosen from 31,000 students from around the country receive their prizes for the Rio Tinto Big Science Competition. I was particularly proud to cheer loudly for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gow" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Gow
        </a>
        , a year 12 student from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indooroopilly_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Indooroopilly State High School
        </a>
        in my electorate of Ryan. Michael was one of only eight in his year 12 category to win a prize in this competition which aims to enthuse our students and encourage them to study science and to consider science based careers. It should also be noted that Michael is a year younger than interstate year 12 students. I speak of Michael and his achievement in winning this award not only to congratulate him personally but also to recognise his teachers both past and present who will have played a role in his success by their own hard work and dedication.

        The Rio Tinto Big Science Competition is a one-hour paper that tests students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as their scientific knowledge. Each year the top-scoring students, with their teacher or parent, are flown to Canberra for the award ceremony at Parliament House. Competitions like these are an excellent way to encourage hardworking students who may one day be responsible for scientific achievements that can benefit all of humanity, and I therefore commend all those involved for their contribution to this exceptional program.
