        Each and every one of them is a very worthy recipient of the Order of Australia award. All they have done, and continue to do, is bring dignity to the Order of Australia to which they now belong. They are fine examples of the best that Australia has to offer, and I take my hat off to everything they have achieved in life and everything that they continue to bring to the communities they represent.
