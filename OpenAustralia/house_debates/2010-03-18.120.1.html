        I rise today to speak in support of those ADF personnel who risked their lives after the

        </a>
        on 16 April 2009. In doing so, I join my colleague Senator David Johnston, shadow minister for defence, in saying absolutely and unequivocally that those

        men and women involved in the SIEV 36 incident should be hailed as heroes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was personally disappointed with the responses of some commentators who insinuated that ADF personnel somehow acted inappropriately by not first rescuing Afghans from the water following the explosion. I personally conveyed those very sentiments to the

        , Vice Admiral Russ Crane, after the incident and to this day I remain disappointed with the unfair treatment those ADF personnel had to endure at the hands of sensationalist commentators and pundits. I was also disappointed by the complete silence of both the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, Mr Combet, and the Minister for

        coroner’s report on the SIEV 36 incident was released yesterday. While the report identified some issues with regard to the manner in which the vessel was searched, which I understand have now been remedied by Defence, Coroner Greg Cavanagh categorically supported the conduct of the ADF personnel. In the report, Coroner Cavanagh said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There were many heroic acts that morning in the process of saving the passengers and crew of SIEV 36 and also in their treatment thereafter.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact that the ADF members were recovered and then assisted in the timely rescue and treatment of passengers probably saved many lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        He went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … I have concluded that action taken by navy personnel was appropriate and more passengers might have died but for the action they took.
       </p>
       <p>
        The actions of those ADF personnel involved on that day were those of dedicated, brave and compassionate individuals. They acted with the highest level of integrity and professionalism in what was a very difficult and dangerous set of circumstances. They are the ones charged with the responsibility of dealing with the predictable repercussions of the Rudd Labor government’s failed border protection policy—a policy that will continue to unnecessarily put people’s lives in danger and a policy that will eventually see illegal immigrants processed in Australia. It is a policy that will see refugee visas granted to those very persons responsible for this tragedy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our ADF personnel not only followed standard practices which have been proven to save lives; they acted with bravery and compassion for their fellow human beings. They should be praised for their actions on that day, not criticised.
