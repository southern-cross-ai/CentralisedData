       <p>
        I rise today in this last week of sittings for the year to address an important and historic issue for the parliament and for our nation, and I speak again of the contribution of Australian service men and women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        in general and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        in particular. Nearly four months ago Australia remembered the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. We remembered the amazing efforts of 6RAR against all odds and the critical nature of that battle. We remembered everyone who served in Vietnam in the course of Australia’s longest war. We thanked them. We apologised to them for the appalling way they were treated during and following their service, and we affirmed to them that their great contribution to our nation was in the finest traditions of the Anzacs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like all members, I attended local functions to thank local veterans. One of these was held at the Wandin public hall on Sunday, 1 October. On that afternoon I met a number of veterans, one of whom was Cliff Dohle. I met Cliff and his wife, Joan. Cliff served with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as a helicopter pilot for a long period. He played a critical role in the Battle of Long Tan. We all know of the heroic, brave and determined actions of 6RAR in that rubber plantation five kilometres east of

        </a>
        when, in heavy rain, just over 100 Australian soldiers turned away more than 2½ thousand Vietcong. It was a fierce battle. Late in the afternoon, the soldiers were running low on ammunition and without a new supply they would have been overrun in a very short period of time. Visibility was poor and teeming rain and a low cloud brought on an early darkness. Two choppers, one captained by Cliff Dohle, took off and planned to fly in company but were separated as a result of the conditions. They flew at treetop height, overloaded with large payloads of ammunition, to replenish the supplies of our soldiers in the middle of the firefight. When our soldiers let off the correct flares, the crews pushed out the ammunition on target. Flying in those conditions at such a low height required great poise, bravery and skill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I single out Cliff Dohle today not because his actions were the most heroic—he would never make such a claim himself—but because he represents a group of soldiers and airmen who together risked their lives in a battle against the odds at a critical time in the Vietnam War. I single him out to illustrate every contribution on that day. Long Tan is rightly regarded as Australia’s most fierce and critical battle. Vietnam
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Veterans Day
        </a>
        is held on the anniversary of Long Tan. This does not in any way diminish the contribution of others in other battles; rather, it symbolises the contribution of all.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken before of the need for Australians to thank our veterans for their service and apologise collectively and individually for the disgraceful way in which they were treated at all levels. The Prime Minister rightly apologised on behalf of the nation in August this year. He took another important step in healing those wounds when he laid a wreath at Long Tan just a few weeks ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        No discussion of Long Tan can take place without a candid acknowledgement of the controversy with respect to the issuing of awards and medals following that battle. It has been broadly acknowledged that an injustice occurred. I was heartened back in August when the Prime Minister stated that he and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs would continue to engage with representatives of the veteran community on the issue. The Prime Minister, the minister and many ministers before him have talked of the difficulty in reopening a set of award recommendations without reopening so many other issues. I understand this principle but I would say also that there is a very defensible case for re-examining the Long Tan medals issue in isolation. The battle has been recognised as pivotal. The number of soldiers and airmen involved is small as a consequence of the surprise and nature of that attack 40 years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would say that, 40 years on, we have a great opportunity. I urge the minister to look for ways to resolve the injustice and to overcome the longstanding bureaucratic defence that nothing can be done. In the years ahead our nation will be relying on our Vietnam veterans to carry on the Anzac tradition and keep the memories of our history alive in our local communities and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        s. Soon they will be handed the baton of leadership from our World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        and Korean veterans. It is in our nation’s interest that every Vietnam veteran in Australia feels that their contribution was valued and appreciated. We need, as a nation, to tell the stories of those who fought at Long Tan—the stories of Cliff Dohle and every other Australian who took part.
