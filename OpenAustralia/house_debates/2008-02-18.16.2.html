        Could I firstly, on indulgence, strongly endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister in relation to Pakistan and the democratic elections. It is not overstating it to say that the outcome of not only the democratic process in Pakistan but security arrangements within that country will determine the outcome in Afghanistan and therefore the struggle against terrorism globally. I strongly support the remarks made by the Prime Minister in that regard.
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether there are any additional emails, telephone conversations or indeed any other contact between himself and his office and the convicted criminal

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The emails that we released yesterday were in direct response to a challenge to do so by the Leader of the Opposition and in response to multiple requests by members of the press gallery. They are all the email contact which exists between me and my office and Mr Burke. That is on the basis of an exhaustive search of our email records yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, in various previous statements of mine I have indicated that from time to time there was some telephone contact between me and Mr Burke. I said this last year. Thirdly, on the question of meetings with Mr Burke, I have indicated that we met on three occasions, and the details of those meetings are outlined in my earlier statements.
