        On 19 August I attended the Penshurst West Public School's 60th anniversary fete. This was such a big fete that it had been 10 years in the making. The school held a big event for its 50th anniversary and another big one for its 60th. It was a great day. It was a huge event with literally thousands of attendees and a lot of fantastic rides, community stalls and raffles. They even had camel rides at the fete. It was a particularly well-organised and well-run event. It was great to be able to help out with drawing the raffle in the afternoon. I think there were about 70 or 80 prizes, all donated by local members of the community and local businesses. Penshurst West has 280 students from kindergarten right through to year 6. It was opened back in 1957 and serves, in particular, the Penshurst community and the Mortdale community, where most of the students are drawn from.

        I would like to thank Karla Franklin, who was the main coordinator of the event, and the P&amp;C. This was a very big and complicated event to put on. Karla's organisational skills really came to the fore, and the support of the committee was really important. I would like to thank the principal, Ross Angus, for all of his work in making the day come together and for everything that he does in our community.
