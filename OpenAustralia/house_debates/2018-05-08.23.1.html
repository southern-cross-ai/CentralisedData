       <p>
        The Peel Health Campus has been grievously overlooked by the WA state government. It is the only hospital in Mandurah, which sits in the heart of the Peel region.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHC" rel="nofollow">
         PHC
        </a>
        was opened in 1997, but since then it has not received any significant upgrades. This is despite our region having grown by more than 55,000 residents over the past 20 years. The hospital is hopelessly overworked. The staff at PHC do a fantastic job, as I saw firsthand over Christmas when my father had to visit their emergency ward. However, the facilities are ageing and the services are limited, and the capacity is not acceptable for WA's second-largest city. An emergency department with just 16 beds cannot sustain a city of more than 80,000 people.

        The WA government has continued to overlook the Peel Health Campus. Recently, the federal government announced an extra $190 million for WA hospitals. Our state is grateful; we are grateful. But the distribution of the funding was based on state government priorities and, incredibly, the Peel Health Campus didn't even make their list. Last week I wrote to the WA Premier and health minister to express my disappointment and to offer my assistance in delivering a better deal for the Peel region. The people of Mandurah are angry, and rightly so. They don't want more politics. They just want the situation fixed, and I'm determined to get them a solution.
