        Parliamentary Program. I had Warrant Officer Class 2 Alan Bungate with me, and I asked him to write something about this program to put into the record. These are Alan’s words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program was derived from the British Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme which had been operating successfully at the time for … 19 years. The aim of the program is to provide Members and Senators with practical experience of the ADF so that they can play a more informed and constructive part in the Defence debate. The program has the following objectives:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Provide an understanding of the unit’s role and missions
        </li>
        <li>
         Provide an opportunity to experience life as a service person
        </li>
        <li>
         Provide an awareness and understanding of Defence capabilities, personnel and management issues
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In January 2001, the Minister for Defence Hon John Moore, MP, approved an initial concept plan for the program, and in February 2001 The Hon David Hawker, MP, introduced a private Member’s bill … on the issue which gained bipartisan support. The pilot Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program … was then planned under the direction of its appointed Head,

        Brendan O’Loghlin … A range of attachments options were developed by the three Services and were offered to non re-electing Senators for the 2001 Parliamentary winter recess period. The Minister for Defence delegated responsibility for the Program to the Hon Dr Brendan Nelson … in 2001. The Parliamentary Secretary subsequently approved seven Senators and one MP to participate in the pilot Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In July and August … seven parliamentarians were attached to Defence units for periods of approximately five days. The attachments consisted of … participation in  a major Naval and international exercise in the Darwin area, an

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2003 an exchange element was introduced into the Program. Selected members of the Australian Defence Force were attached to

        </a>
        for a week to observe the workings of Government and spend time observing and participating in the daily work schedule of individual parliamentarians (usually those who have participated in Program attachments). Six officers were attached in 2004 and the exchange is now a permanent part of the ADFPP. Since its inception the program has been supported by 86 Participants, 29 Senators and 57 Federal Members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The program provides selected ADF members with an education and practical experience based program broken into five days. The education program covers detailed topics delivered by the Parliament Clerks.
       </p>
       <p>
        ADF members attend sessions with the clerks as well as sessions with members of parliament.
