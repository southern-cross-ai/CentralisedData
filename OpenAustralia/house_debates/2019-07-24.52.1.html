        Rolling pins were tossed and bricks were thrown through the air at this year's 59th Stroud Brickthrowing Competition. It's an annual competition that started in 1960 when the brickmaking cities of Stroud in England and Stroud in the United States formed the competition. With the participation of Stroud in my electorate, the event is still going strong.

        I was really pleased also to see that the work on repairing the tennis courts following the devastating floods in April 2015 is proceeding apace, courtesy of a federal government grant, with new tennis courts and new change rooms and facilities, and a new multi-purpose centre is also going to be built to replace the two buildings that were literally washed away along with most of the other showground facilities in that devastating flood in 2015. Congratulations!
