        I have a very relevant question to the Leader of the House. I ask him: how are members of the House approaching negotiations on the conduct of the proceedings of the House?

         I thank the member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, for his question. Indeed, as of today, at 1.30, we have passed 112 pieces of legislation through this House—112 supported, zero opposed by this House of Representatives. And we have done that in just eight months. How does that compare with our predecessors? Those opposite would like to say that this parliament cannot function properly because it requires proper negotiation. The fact is that in the first 12 months of the Howard government 108 bills were passed by the House of Representatives, so we have been more efficient and more productive on this side of the House in terms of getting legislation through. Big changes have gone through the House, on the economy, on child care, on family services. This parliament is working efficiently and effectively. Through cooperation and discipline, this government is implementing its agenda to secure the future prosperity of this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we know that discipline is pretty important. I was sent an email earlier on today and it said this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Last night we lost a division because the following five Coalition Members failed to support their colleagues:

         He has always had a problem with emails!

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order. I assume, in order to be directly relevant, the Leader of the House will refer to the fact that they failed to get a quorum yesterday for the government.

           </p>
           <p>
            And it goes through the members Tudge, Kelly, Simpkins, Southcott and Frydenberg and their respective margins. It then goes on—and it gets better. It says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is an interesting point to note that all the Members who missed the division occupy safe seats, while, of the Members prevented from speaking in the adjournment debate three are first term Members and all occupy marginal or key seats.
           </p>
           <p>
            It then goes on to say:

           <p class="italic">
            Members are elected to Parliament to represent their constituents. That includes being present when the Parliament divides on a question.

            . They are all having a go there, and I know that this was of great interest particularly to the member for Wentworth, who saw it as part of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has done for political discourse what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer—lots of noise, interesting at the beginning but annoying when that is the only noise it can make. The only noise it can make is one of opposition.
