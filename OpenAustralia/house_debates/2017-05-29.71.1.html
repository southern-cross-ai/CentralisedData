        My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer outline for the House the government's commitment to fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme and other services while bringing the budget back into surplus and living within our means? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Mackellar for his question and his concern and support for the fact that this government is guaranteeing essential services in this budget. Importantly, the Turnbull government decided in this budget—made the right choice—to say yes to fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a $55.7 billion black hole left by those opposite for funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have said yes to ensuring the full funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Labor Party have said no. They are saying no to fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We are saying yes to giving certainty to Australians and their families who are living with a disability, and the Labor Party have chosen to deny that certainty to Australians living with a disability by saying no.
        </p>
        <p>
         Former Labor Minister John Della Bosca, who ran the Every Australian Counts campaign, has said very clearly that he was calling on this government to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme and, indeed, he was directly calling on me to do that. In this budget, we said yes to the Every Australian Counts campaign; and those opposite, the Labor Party, said no to that campaign, said no to fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Mr Della Bosca has said our choice to say yes to fully fund that scheme through a half a percentage point increase in the Medicare levy is a win for every Australian. He said it means people with a disability in Australia finally have certainty. And he has called on the Labor Party and minor parties not to compromise the bipartisanship that has existed since the National Disability Insurance Scheme was first introduced—supported by those in the Liberal and National parties—by standing in the way of ensuring this guaranteed funding. He also said we all have a role to play. And it is important to understand what sits behind our proposal to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which we have said yes to.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also said yes to guaranteeing Medicare. We have also said yes to needs-based funding in our schools. We have said yes to first home buyers, who deserve a tax cut so they can save for their first home. We have said yes to small businesses to lower their tax and we have said yes to ensure we bring the budget back into balance. And we know that the ratings agencies have responded to all of this by saying yes to our

          AAA
         </a>
         rating after the budget. But those opposite continue to say no. They continue to say no to those who want the certainty of fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme and to parents who want the certainty of the school funding which the government is offering. This government will stand in the middle ready to work with the parliament to get these things done. The Labor Party just want to say no.
