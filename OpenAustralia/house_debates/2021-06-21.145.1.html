        Recently during National Volunteers Week I had the privilege of recognising just some of the thousands of volunteers in the community at the annual Werriwa Volunteer Awards. I congratulate the 2021 winners: Kieran, Saleema, Sheethwa, Anne-Marie, Krishna, Gwenda and Sanjavi Kumar. I especially thank the people in our community who have taken the time to nominate the awardees. The volunteers come from all parts of our communityâ€”Meals on Wheels, Sewa Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNM" rel="nofollow">
         CNM
        </a>
        Italian Services, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        , headspace, Prestons Robins Little Athletics, Mounties, environmental groups, sporting clubs, public schools and the list goes on. Sewa Australia, in particular, coordinates blood drives three times a year, with one of their volunteers having recorded more than 70 donations of blood and plasma in just three years.

        Volunteers ensure that important community activities such as delivering meals, allowing children to play sport and providing disaster relief can take place. Almost six million Australians over the age of 15 volunteer their time across the country each year. The rate, however, has declined by almost eight per cent in the last 10 years. Casualisation of the workforce, stay-at-home requirements for older Australians in the pandemic and other stresses often mean the same commitments can no longer be met, but I thank all volunteers in Werriwa who take the time to serve their community. You make our community the wonderful place it is.

        I also had the pleasure of visiting the new mycar store at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmondson_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Edmondson Park
        </a>
        . Mycar is one of the largest employers in the automotive service and repair industry, with more than 1,300 employees Australia-wide and 260 store locations. They are also the single largest employer of apprentice motor mechanics in Australia. Thank you to Adam and the team for showing me the impressive new store and explaining the innovative measures you employ. Mycar recycles all the oil it uses. It does so with purpose-built methods which keep the workshop clean and make sure it can all be recycled. I wish you all the best for your future within Werriwa.

        Two weeks ago,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Liverpool Council
        </a>
        hosted a civic reception for the South West Sydney Academy of Sport athletes. As a previous board member, I know the academy provides an opportunity for elite athletes, coaches and administrators to both improve their skills and learn new concepts in nutrition, leadership and fitness. Many of the graduates of the program have represented Australia,

        and regional areas at the elite level, even winning gold medals at the Olympics. To this year's representatives: good luck for the future. Thank you to Gerry Knights, Peter and the volunteer board members for all you do to ensure that the youth in our community get the opportunities they deserve.
