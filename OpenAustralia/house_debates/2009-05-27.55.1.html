        My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer him to my earlier question to him and the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        ’s question to the Treasurer. In each case, we asked the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to provide the House with the projected economic growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses and other financial assumptions through to 2022 that would support the Prime Minister’s dubious claim that all of the massive debt he is running up will be repaid by that date. I refer to the answer that each of them gave, which was that these assumptions were to be found in the budget papers. I would ask the Prime Minister to take the House to the table and the page where those assumptions are laid out.

         The Leader of the Opposition, in his question, referred to ‘dubious assumptions’.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         just say that the most dubious assumption being advanced by those opposite is that this country’s deficit and debt strategy is not consistent with a responsible return to budget surplus. The government has provided five years of sets of forecasts and projections for the future; our predecessors provided four. The government’s strategy to return the budget to surplus is outlined in the budget papers. We stand by the strategy.

            <p>
             The government’s strategy is Nation Building for Recovery. The government’s strategy is to build the economy up; the opposition’s strategy is to talk the economy down. That is it in a nutshell. Those opposite are happy to talk the economy down, to tear the economy down, because they have concluded that it might actually boost their political prospects. That is what it is all about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our strategy is clear. Nation Building for Recovery will support jobs, businesses, apprenticeships and training for today by investing in the nation-building infrastructure we need for tomorrow—nation-building infrastructure which a large slab of those opposite have a particular interest in supporting in their electorates and distancing themselves from here in Canberra. Seventy per cent of the government’s nation-building and economic stimulus plan has been targeted towards infrastructure. That means $60 billion is being invested in infrastructure like rail, roads, ports, broadband, solar energy and the biggest school modernisation program Australia has ever seen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The budget alone invests $22 billion in further infrastructure stimulus. The consequence for jobs is that we will support more than 200,000 jobs that would otherwise be destroyed by the global economic recession—200,000 jobs which those opposite, we assume, would prefer to have thrown onto the unemployment queue. Many Australians will be witnessing construction rolled out at their schools across the nation, across our towns and communities, as we speak. I would ask the House to reflect on this number: 35,000 jobs will be rolled out across the country under our Nation Building for Recovery program. I would like to take the opportunity to report to the House that construction is already well underway. For the benefit of the parliament, I can table an updated list of projects which have been approved for construction. I can table, for example—and I will—a folder of projects already approved under round 1 of the Australian School Pride Program. We have projects here from the—

Is Palmwoods in the member for Fisher’s electorate or in the member for Fairfax’s electorate? I presume the member for Fairfax welcomes that investment. I table that particular update. I also table a folder of projects already approved under round 2 of the Australian School Pride Program. If those opposite have an interest in their content, they can sit down and have a read.

                  The member for Fadden would be objecting to projects in his electorate, I assume. The member for Fadden is in the House, standing on his feet now and saying that he does not want any investment in schools in his electorate.

                       On a point of order, Mr Speaker: you have warned members opposite for holding up material. Why is the Prime Minister not being warned for doing exactly the same thing? Surely there should be one standard, the same standard, for all members of this House, including the Prime Minister.

                           thinks that he is trying to help me, but sometimes he does not. I just wish to respond to the point of order raised by the member for Warringah. In doing so, I refer to a ruling of the Speaker back on 15 June 2006:

While I accept what you have said, the fact of the matter is that it would be much easier for members on this side of the House if the Prime Minister were held to an appropriate standard.

                                     What we have witnessed in the parliament today is the Liberal and National parties in absolute disarray—a Liberal Party standing up in the parliament and saying, ‘Yes, we want investment in our local schools,’ and, ‘No, we will not vote for that investment here in Canberra.’ What absolute rancid hypocrisy. I also table a folder of major rail, road and boom gates and black spots projects across Australia. The Leader of the National Party guffaws, as is his custom. I would have thought that any Nat standing up in this parliament and thinking about the importance of boom gate repair across Australia would, if they were worth their salt, stand up for the good folk of the bush and say that we need this extra investment in boom gates and black spots to enhance security.

Let it be stated here formally, therefore, on the record that the Liberals and Nationals here have voted against 20,000 social housing projects, 11,000 projects in primary schools, 802 defence housing projects—Member for Herbert, hang your head in shame—17 major rail projects, 14 major road projects, 500 black spots projects, 250 boom gate projects—National Party, hang your collective head in shame—and 3,168 community infrastructure projects. The one exception, of course, is if we subtract those projects within the schools area for the member for Canning, because he stood up today and said that he in fact meant to vote with the government when this was actually put through.

                                               What we have here is the most appalling display of Liberal Party hypocrisy, underlined yesterday by the minister for infrastructure standing in this place, showing one Liberal member after another and one National member after another attending supportively the launch of local investment projects in local schools right around the country, and piously, hypocritically claiming that they do not support the investment in these projects whatsoever. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia do not believe what those opposite stand for? We stand for building the Australian economy up; you stand for tearing the Australian economy down.

                                                My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that the Rudd government is now the biggest-spending government in modern Australian history, with government spending at around 29 per cent of
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

                                                . I refer to the fact that the Rudd government has now the biggest net debt since World War
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

                                                , and I refer to the fact the Rudd government is putting it all on the nation’s credit card, the Ruddcard—$315 billion of debt. I ask the Treasurer: where exactly in the budget papers are the justifications for the Prime Minister’s claim that he is going to pay off the nation’s credit card by 2022? I seek leave to table all of these documents in the same way the Prime Minister did.

It is not about the forecasts; it is about a Liberal Party scare campaign, because this government has done the responsible thing. We have had a revenue collapse of $210 billion, which they want to pretend has not occurred. The member for Higgins was in the House last night pretending that the mining boom did not give us a revenue surge—telling everybody how brilliant he was and in the next breath pretending that we had not had a revenue collapse from the collapse of the mining boom. Well, of course we have, and the consequence of that is that we have had to borrow responsibly to support jobs.

                                                         We have outlined in unprecedented detail in the budget papers our medium-term fiscal policy, in a way which those opposite have never done. They claimed to be serious about an intergenerational report and then did nothing about it—so the task falls to us. The task falls to the Labor Party, in the teeth of the global recession, to protect our people by responsible borrowing, by investing in modernising our schools and by investing in infrastructure to support jobs and businesses in our community. What those opposite are so embarrassed about is that, if we take the proposition put by the shadow Treasurer here today to its logical conclusion, what they stand for is higher unemployment and more business failures—because all of these projects that are creating jobs and supporting businesses in our community would not be happening right now. To camouflage their lack of alternative they have to run this seedy campaign against the forecasts and the projections which have been put forward in good faith by the Commonwealth Treasury.
