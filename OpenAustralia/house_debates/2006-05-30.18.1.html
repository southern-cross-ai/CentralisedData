        My question is again to the Prime Minister and is about the Spotlight 2c an hour
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
         AWA
        </a>
        which would see Mrs Annette Harris lose $90 a week in take-home pay. I ask whether the Prime Minister has seen the statement by Mrs Harris in this week’s
        <i>

        </i>
        :

         Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. All members will put those posters down immediately. The Prime Minister will resume his seat. I asked the Leader of the Opposition to resume his seat before he had completed his question. I will give him the opportunity to finish his question, but he will not display that poster again. I call the Leader of the Opposition.

            I have repeatedly said that the strength of the Australian economy is due to the efforts of the working men and women of this country. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the working men and women of Australia have been more adequately rewarded for their efforts under this government than they were under the former Labor government. The last person in this parliament who can speak with pride about rewarding the ordinary working men and women of this country is the former Deputy Prime Minister in the Keating government because, as those who follow these matters will know, real wages under this government have increased by 16.8 per cent over the last 10 years compared to a paltry increase of only 1.3 per cent under Labor. In relation to Mrs Annette Harris, I am informed that she exercised her right to reject the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
             AWA
            </a>
            and remains employed as a part-time employee on the relevant award after refusing to accept the AWA.
