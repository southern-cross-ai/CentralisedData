           I thank the member for her question. And let me say it is great to have a wonderful new member for Dobell who is passionate about the interests of her electorate and who is passionate about the interests of young people in Dobell and creating opportunities for our young people. I was delighted on Friday to visit the Central Coast Wetlands Pioneer Dairy, a great local community project, driven by great volunteers, with the support of a Work for the Dole team, sponsored through Break Thru People Solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
           It was a great project. The local member introduced me to a number of motivated job seekers who have been working on that program, and they said to me that Work for the Dole had changed their attitude to the workplace. We know the members opposite hate Work for the Dole. It is in their

             But Work for the Dole is a program that can deliver great community outcomes and deliver great skills to young job seekers. When I spoke to the participants, they were glowing in their praise of Work for the Dole and the way in which Work for the Dole had changed their attitude to work and the workplace. I spoke to a young man called Aaron. When Aaron started his placement, he initially he did not travel too well. He had a bit of trouble getting involved in the program. But over time his skills developed, and every day he used to enjoy getting up and getting on with the project and being part of delivering the outcomes at Pioneer Dairy.

                 The members opposite will not want to hear this, but Aaron was able to tell me that he had secured a job, which was great news, through Work for the Dole. We know the members have spent their time running down the Work for the Dole program that they inherited from the Howard era, but this government is committed. I announced phase 1 last week of the revamped Work for the Dole which will scale up the Work for the Dole program. And today I released a survey, and that survey said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Making basic adjustments to their attitude and physical presentation is the most effective thing that many young job seekers can do to improve their employment prospects.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That is why we are increasing the amount of Work for the Dole programs available. That is why we are increasing the number of opportunities for young people to develop the sorts of skills which have been run down under the members opposite.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We believe in the ability of Work for the Dole to deliver the skills that young people need to get a leg up in the workplace—to get that start that they need; to deliver the skills that employers want. We on this side of the House support Work for the Dole. The members opposite in their time in government ran down Work for the Dole.
