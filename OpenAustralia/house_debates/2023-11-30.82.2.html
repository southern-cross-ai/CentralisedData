           At every turn in the way the government has handled this matter we have focused on one thing, and one thing only, and that is the safety of the Australian community. Meanwhile, what we have seen are constant and pathetic attempts—

             What we've seen is a deep contrast with the opposition, who have tried at every turn to duck, weave and find some way to make politics out of this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, you would think that the work that our government has tried to undertake to protect the community would be supported across the chamber, but we have seen and heard some absolutely extraordinary things in the last three weeks. On Monday we saw the opposition, led by the Leader of the Opposition, come into the chamber and vote to protect paedophiles over children. That's what they did. They came in here and, instead of supporting Labor's attempts to criminalise paedophiles who loiter near daycare centres and schools, the Leader of the Opposition came in here and played politics.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that wasn't it. The work that the government was doing with that bill was not just about protecting children from paedophiles. It was also doing things like criminalising people who are violent domestic abusers who contact their victims. How could the opposition not support that? And yet, for politics and politics only, they came into the chamber and voted against it.

              Order! The minister will pause. The member for Fadden is on a warning. That means you don't interject, so you'll leave the chamber under 94(a). It's the same for anyone else on a warning, which are the members for Barker and Deakin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Page and the Minister for Skills and Training.

               But that wasn't it. We saw the opposition come in and try to support paedophiles over children and support domestic abusers over their survivor victims. What we have also seen this week is an unspeakable lack of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition in calling to attention the behaviour of one of his front bench.

                   As a precedent as to why this should be in order, when Speaker Smith was Speaker, a member referring to the then shadow Attorney-General said this:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   He stands up instead for the criminal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It was considered to be in order. The person who made that statement is now the Leader of the Opposition.

                       To the point of order: it's extraordinary that we're having this discussion after the motion that was just moved. Beyond that, what the minister referred to was the impact of a vote that members took. She has precisely described the impact of that vote.

                        Order! There are two points I want to make on this. First of all, before this moment occurred, I just addressed the House and said there was far too much noise and there were people on warnings. If you want me to hear everything that is said, it's really simple: don't interject. I'm going to ask the minister to make sure her language is tempered and to make sure that she is not reflecting on members. At the same time, I'm going to ask all members to reflect on their behaviours and standards that have been occurring this week. The Leader of the Opposition?

                         I would ask that you request the minister withdraw the reflection that was made on members on this side of the House. As I said before, with all respect to you, I don't believe it's an issue, frankly, that needed to be drawn to your attention, because I was anticipating your ruling. I would ask that you rule accordingly.

                           Mr Speaker, to the point of order: only a moment ago the Leader of the Opposition took a decision that had been made by the High Court, not by the government, and made reflections on the government with respect to 'child rapists, murderers, people smugglers, drug dealers and outlaw motorcycle gang members'. That goes further than anything the minister just said. So, if there's going to be—and I'd say there ought not be—a withdrawal from the minister, there are about seven or eight withdrawals that would immediately have to happen from someone with a glass jaw who can dish it out but can't take it.

That is a statement of fact.

The same principles will apply. I put up with a lot this week. It's the right of members to say what they wish. But, moving forward now, the same standards will apply with motions, questions and comments in the chamber. I'm going to ask the minister, to assist the House, to withdraw, and we'll move forward.

                                   It's important that all of us in this chamber are accountable for our actions. And, whether that comment stands or not, the facts show the record. And the record is, on a bill that Labor put forward to criminalise paedophiles standing in front of schools, the Leader of the Opposition and his team voted against it, and you cannot hide from that. And it's not the only example of this kind of conduct, because we have had a deafening silence from the Leader of the Opposition about the behaviour of a hand-picked member of his frontbench, Senator Dean Smith, who chose to use his power to argue that a paedophile get released from immigration detention. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition—he likes to get up and speak emotionally about child sexual abuse—that he's got an opportunity to make a stand, and I want him to do it.
