        I'm here to talk about the Great Australian Round Up and I'm not talking about question time. I'm talking about stock handling and cow work; I'm talking about a dry work program; I'm talking about the arrival of cattle and ranch sorting national finals and the stockman's challenge. All of these are going to be happening in Tamworth. They're coming up and they're going to be part of how we show off the stock skills that are part and parcel of what we see in rodeos. They're part and parcel of what we see in campdraft. They are part and parcel of what we see at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamworth_Country_Music_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Tamworth Country Music Festival
        </a>
        . It will be held from 19 to 20 January 2019 during the country music festival. It's a charity event to raise money for the Burrumbuttock Hay Runners and other vital rural services assisting with drought aid. The main event will be held at the ABCRA, the Australian Bushmen's Campdraft and Rodeo Association, and will also feature the stockman's challenge, working dog trials, whip cracking and sheep shearing. It will be a must-see for so many people.

        Bush skills and stock skills are part of the culture of regional Australia, and I think a lot of people want to get out and have a look at them. They might be able to incorporate some of those skills down here. I suppose the party whips would like to go up there and have a look at how they can get put a bell on them, hobble them, keep them where they are, prod them along and get them to go where they need them to go. Those will be the sorts of skills that you'll be shown in Tamworth. I'm looking forward to being there, and I'm inviting all of you as well.
