       <p>
        Today I rise to congratulate Penrith's own
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Fox" rel="nofollow">
         Jessica Fox
        </a>
        . On Monday, Jessica made history with her double victory at the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Maryland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        . It was only April this year where Jess took out both the C-l and K-1 titles at the under-23 world championships in Penrith. She has now backed up that incredible feat to also achieve that at the senior level.
       </p>
       <p>
        The result comes exactly 25 years after her parents won their world titles, also in the USA, and they were on hand to celebrate with Jess when she screamed for joy after crossing the finish line. I know Richard and Myriam, the entire Penrith community and the nation are immensely proud of Jessica and her achievements. Jessica is a wonderful ambassador for the Nepean Valley. She is a fabulous local hero and the wonderful role model for so many young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        To achieve such an extraordinary result at such a young age is a credit to Jess's determination and dedication to her sport and also the contribution that her entire family has made to canoeing internationally. The canoeing sport is made so much better by the work of the Fox family. I would like to congratulate Jess for this outstanding result and for continuing to be such a wonderful ambassador for our region. I would also like to thank the Fox family for all that they have done. I look forward to seeing Naomi Fox also hit the international stage and win at a senior level. Congratulations.
