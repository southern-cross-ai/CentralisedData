        , or 'Murph' as he was affectionately known, was considered by many to be a great Territorian for all Territorians. Peter was most certainly legendary. He was well respected by all, and revered by many, throughout his 40-year career. Our community recognised his contributions in 2007 by awarding him an OAM for his services to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        as a result of his outstanding career in journalism and his career as a political adviser. Peter was known as a straight shooter and a person who was across all political issues. He was an amazing strategist and someone who was not afraid to pull any punches, no matter who you were. It is quite incredible to think that Peter worked with all bar one of the Country Liberal Party Chief Ministers.

        Peter was passionate about the Northern Territory and he was involved in the early days of developing Territory links with our Asian neighbours. It certainly would be fair to say that Peter's influence is still being felt through some of the strategic measures being implemented today. Peter had a good handle on Territory issues as well as the capacity to look at the national perspective. He was very considered and strategic in his approach. In the words of his good friend

        Peter was ... Catholic, a man of faith who did his best to live by certain ideals enshrined in his upbringing ... He was and remained one of the most influential Territorians in his time yet you won't find him through Googleâ€”that's the real influence.

        It was an honour to have known Peter and I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to work with him, albeit for a very short time. Peter's support and guidance were invaluable and he will be missed by all. May he rest in peace. My deepest condolences to Peter's wife, Lani, and to their children, Sean, Donnagh, Kelly and Siobhan.
