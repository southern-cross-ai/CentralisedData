       <p>
        I'd like to congratulate the 2019 Australian Special Olympics team who recently returned home from competing in

        . There were 105 athletes with intellectual disabilities from across Australia who competed in 11 sports and came away with an impressive number of medals. But, more importantly, they came away with incredible memories and a real sense of pride for their sport, their nation and themselves. Amongst the athletes was Rutherford local

        , who brought home a silver medal in football. Good on you, James! James's family and I and his community are so incredibly proud of him.

        All of these athletes deserve so much respect from us. They have represented our nation with pride and dignity. Yet, after last night's budget, it seems this government has thrown the respect for people living with a disability out the window. In the wise words of the member for Jagajaga, every time the Prime Minister boasts about a surplus, just remember that $1.6 billion of that surplus is because people with a disability are being short-changed through a massive underspend on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Don't let that fact escape you, Australia. If this parliament is to reach a surplus at the expense of our most vulnerable—people with a disability, veterans and the unemployed—this is no budget to be proud of. Bring on the election! Shame on this government!
