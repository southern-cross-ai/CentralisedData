        Last Friday I attended an important function in Melbourne at the home of the Consul-General for Greece, Mrs Eleni Lianidou. The function was held in honour of Australian veterans who fought in the Battle of Crete. The ceremony involved the presentation of four Greek Army Medals of Honour to the four Victorian veterans and their families. This year's commemoration is especially significant as it marks the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete, which began on 20 May 1941. Over the years, the commemoration of the Battle of Crete has gained greater significance in Australia as more generations of families and the young are acknowledging the significance of this battle and that during the Battle of Crete many Anzac and

        troops, along with Greeks and Cypriots, fought alongside each other and many died together. Of the 7,100 Australians who fought in the battle, 274 were killed, 507 were wounded and 3,079 were captured. Of the 11,451 Greek soldiers who fought, 426 were killed, 850 were wounded and over 5,000 were captured. In addition, at least 3,000 Greek civilians, mostly Cretans, died while defending their island. In a fitting tribute to all the lives lost and the significance of the battle, this year the two remaining veterans, Private Basil Hayler, of the

        , of the 2nd Infantry Battalion and prisoner of war, will be travelling to Crete for the anniversary.

        I have been to Crete and I know of the affection that the Cretan people have towards Australians. That strong bond that was forged through the self-sacrifice of the people of Crete while protecting Australian soldiers from the invading forces has never wavered. The presentation ceremony that I attended in Melbourne of the Greek Army Medals of Honour to the last remaining Victorian veterans and to the sons and grandson of the three veterans who are now deceased was especially humbling.

        It is always humbling to be in the presence of a soldier. As he received his medal, Private Thomas Robert Morris, veteran of the Battle of Crete, 2/5 Battalion, stood very strong and very proudâ€”because once a soldier, always a soldier. Despite his advanced age, Private Morris had clear memories of the people of Crete. He felt strongly for a people who, as he said, risked their lives to protect him and other allied soldiers. The son of Major William Gordon Leyton Parker, Mr Timothy William Parker, received the medal on behalf of his father; the son of Private William Arthur Moulton, Mr Vaughan Moulton, received the medal on behalf of his father; and, lastly, the fourth medal was received proudly by the grandson of Private George Charles Maxwell, Mr Adam Luscombe.
