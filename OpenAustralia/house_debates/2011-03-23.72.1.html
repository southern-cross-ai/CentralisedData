         I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is the first question he has actually asked me this week as the shadow minister for immigration, and I thank him for it. As I indicated yesterday to the honourable member for Gippsland, I am aware of two reports in relation to suggestions of violence on

              The warnings are the two that I have referred to. Clearly, as I have said continuously, I have recognised for some time, since last September, that we needed to reduce pressure on the detention centre at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
               Christmas Island
              </a>
              . One of the reasons we needed to reduce the pressure on the detention centre at Christmas Island was the pressure that that created in relation to the management of the detention centre. I have made that clear. That is why I announced the mainland detention centres to relieve the pressure on Christmas Island. I did that in response to advice from my department that the pressure on Christmas Island should be reduced. I have done that, against the opposition of those members opposite, who said that those detention centres were not necessary.

               where, under the heading ‘Answers to questions without notice’, it says:

              <p class="italic">
               When a Minister is occasionally unable to provide an immediate substantive answer, he or she may either undertake to supply the Member with the requested information in writing at a later date …
              </p>
              <p>
               As the minister is unable to provide the answer, perhaps he could follow that.

                 and have taken steps to reduce the pressure on the Christmas Island detention centre. I have done so in conjunction with the advice from my department that the numbers on Christmas Island would benefit from being reduced in relation to the opening of detention centres on the mainland, which the opposition opposed at every step. I have established an independent, arms-length inquiry, which I invite the honourable member for Cook to make a submission to.
