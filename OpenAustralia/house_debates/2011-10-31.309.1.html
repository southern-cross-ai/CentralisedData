        I want to use this opportunity to focus on some of the positive things happening in the electorate of Forde. We have some great community groups and wonderful students in our schools. The Beenleigh Theatre Group was established in 1978 by a small group who were passionate about performing and participating in live theatre. Many of the original members are still active in the ensemble today. They provide great entertainment for all ages and the audience is always guaranteed an enjoyable evening. I would like to congratulate them on their latest production, the musical

        . On their opening night, 21 October, they performed to a packed house. I had the privilege of going to the pre-opening night presentation. It was a fantastic night. I got to speak to a few of the cast and everybody had a great time. I am really pleased to see this great community group going from strength to strength each year.

        It is coming to that time of the year when our grade 12 students are completing their secondary education and are looking to going on to university or

        college. Some students I have been speaking to are going on a world trip, having a year off before they go to universityâ€”a gap year. I want to pass on my congratulations to them for their 12 or maybe more years of hard work at school to get to this point. Also, I congratulate their parents and teachers for supporting the students. As a parent with a grade 12 student, I know that a lot of work has gone in over the years in transporting the kids to sport and extracurricular activities, cajoling them to complete assignments and to study for their exams. I am sure many parents will be pleased to see that time coming to an end.

        On the weekend I had the opportunity to attend the sixth annual Woodland's billycart derby. This time, given the development of the estate, they had a new course. It was great fun for all concerned. Unfortunately, there were a few crashes in the new chicane they put together. My congratulations go to all the winners and to the community. It was beautiful weather and a joy get out, and to meet and greet people in the local community. Everybody had a fun time and we are looking forward to next year.
