        I'd like to congratulate Collins Creek Public School, which recently celebrated 100 years. Credit for the celebrations goes to the acting principal, Joy Muller; her centenary committee; the P &amp; C; and staff, who include Chantelle Forbes, Tamara Tiffin, Nyssa Stevens, Tamar Cohen, Krishna Lawrence, Priya Beshara, Camilla Warner, Justin Vasterink, David Hausen, Rebecca Tapscott, Uncle Wayne—or

        for catering lunch; and Gateway Fine Foods for catering dinner. Large crowds, including former and current students and staff, their families and the community, shared the opportunity to catch up, with many stories and memories. The students performed musical items showcasing their talents with recorder, ukulele, percussion, drums, singing and marimbas. They also buried a time capsule providing a snapshot of life in 2019. Historical displays were set up in the classrooms, which included photos and videos. The CWA were on hand to cater for a picnic on the grounds. A new centenary book for the school has now been compiled, adding the last 25 years to the book published on the 75th anniversary of the school. Congratulations, Collins Creek Public School.

        The countdown is on for St Joseph's Primary School Alstonville's 100-year celebrations. Every year the school holds its annual Big Family Day, which normally caters for to up to 600 people. This year, though, on Friday, 31 August it will be a little different as they will be celebrating the centenary of the school community as well. Thanks to the organisational abilities of the principal, Therese Seymour, and staff members Ros Kingsford, Kasey Miles, Liz Bugden and Emma Thrum, visitors will be able to step back in time and see how the school grew from when it was established in 1919. Each of the classrooms and the school library will be decked out for a particular time period from the 1920s up until now. The students are also currently preparing a time capsule to be buried for future generations. They recently dug up the previous time capsule from the 75th school celebrations in 1994 and found newspapers of the day, uniforms, newsletters and children's works. There was even a letter from 10-year-old Elizabeth McMahon, who was a student in year 4 and is now better known as Libby Spash, a teacher at the school. Saturday night will see a big dinner where 200 people are expected to attend, including the
