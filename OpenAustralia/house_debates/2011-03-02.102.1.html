       <p>
        Today I want to acknowledge the work of the Hampton Park Progress Association subcommittee of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        committee in organising the Day of Nations Australia Day celebration—the first of two venues for the Holt Australia Day awards. The turnout for this event was incredible, with many hundreds of people turning out for a free hot breakfast and entertainment, including multicultural dancers, bagpipe performances, rides for the kids and much more. The strong turnout and extraordinary atmosphere is a testament to the dedicated work by president, Tony O’Hara, and the rest of the organising committee, including Warren Calder, Vanessa Gerdes and Erica Maliki. To these community minded people, I say: thank you for that fantastic event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the Doveton Eumemmerring Neighbourhood Renewal, who in partnership with the Doveton Neighbourhood Learning Centre organised the Doveton Actively Diverse Australia Day celebration, the second venue for the Holt Australia Day awards. This was held in Autumn Place in Doveton. It should be noted the state government funded the Doveton Eumemmerring Neighbourhood Renewal, and it will be completing its eighth and final term this financial year. Despite the fact that the team is now wrapping up this project, it is clear that the work that this committee has done has left a substantial legacy in the community, evidenced by long-lasting outcomes and successful programs, and numerous stakeholders that have taken on the programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apart from the events that the program has helped establish, including the Australia Day celebrations, the annual Doveton show and the monthly open mic night, the project is also responsible for a range of other achievements in the community. Just some of the supported programs and successes include: more than 380 residents have undertaken training in skills shortage areas, such as childcare, aged care, hospitality, asset maintenance, transport logistics, construction and metal fabrication; and more than 90 residents have gained employment. Further to these achievements, the following successes have also occurred: more than 600 significant internal and external upgrades and enhancements to Office of Housing houses undertaken in the community; establishment of the quarterly newsletter ‘3177 News’, which is now distributed to every household in the Doveton-Eumemmerring community; the establishment of a fresh food market that operates every Thursday from Myuna Farm; the establishment of a community tool shed, operating at the Doveton Neighbourhood Learning Centre; the establishment of the Brotherhood of St Laurence Centre for Work and Learning; and the establishment of the Doveton-Eumemmerring Township Committee, driven by residents to advocate on behalf of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the team members near the completion of the program, I would like this chamber to know of the difference they have made in the Doveton-Eumemmerring community, including the positive effects on community pride and participation levels. To the current staff of Tammy Osborne,

        , Anna-Marija Zika, Catherine Naylor and Cheryl Majhrovski, and the former staff, including Anita Francis, Terri Fellows, Kerri Elso, Cameron Price and Dina Jaballah I say: thank you for your work in the project and making the Doveton community an even better and safer place to live.
