        If ever there was an example of the Prime Minister saying one thing and doing another, it is in the area of climate change.

          Climate change does have me worried—thank you for the interjection. Climate change should have us all worried. And the Prime Minister,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
           Malcolm Turnbull
          </a>
          , for years, has said, over and over again, that he is concerned about climate change and that he wants the best policy. He supported the Labor government in its policy to introduce an emissions trading scheme, and we all know, because we all heard him say it over and over again, that he believed that was the best method and the most efficient method to lower emissions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now that he is the Prime Minister he does not seem to care about climate change, and he certainly does not do what he said he would do or act according to the beliefs he demonstrated over many years. He says that emissions are reducing. They are not. The government released its latest emissions projections in December, and they show that emissions went up in the last financial year by 1.3 per cent—the first increase in 10 years. And that is a reason to be worried. That is a very real reason to be worried. They went up, for the first time in 10 years, by 1.3 per cent. And not only that; the projections that the government produced showed no decrease in sight. It is an upward trajectory—up and up and up, with no decrease in sight. It is projected to beat the peaks of 2005-06.
