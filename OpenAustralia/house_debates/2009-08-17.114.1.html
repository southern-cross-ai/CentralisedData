       <p>
        On Friday, I received two phone calls, one notifying me of the death of Harry Moore
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , former state member for Wyong and former Wyong shire councillor. Harry was a legend on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , a rough diamond brought up in the school of hard knocksâ€”that is how he described himself. He worked hard and achieved greatness. Harry never forgot what it is like to struggle and never forgot the importance of family and community. He was dedicated to the Central Coast. He was involved in every possible community organisation and was a patron of practically every organisation. He was particularly committed to Legacy, was very instrumental in the development of Wyong Hospital and he was very active in supporting veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other person I received a phone call about was Desmond Hughes, a Labor Party stalwart, somebody who had worked hard for me over the years. Like Harry, Des came from a humble background. He constantly worked. When he passed away, he was a self-educated man, he was computer literate and active in the community. He spent all his time fighting to support people less privileged than himself. I feel very privileged to have known both these men. They were outstanding examples of what people can do to contribute to their community.
