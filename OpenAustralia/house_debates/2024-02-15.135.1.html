        Picture this: two weeks ago, Sunday 4 February, gorgeous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Brighton Beach
        </a>
        , white sands, calm blue waters, sunny and 26 degrees—and 664 gorgeous blonde bombshells sashaying down

         Jetty Road
        </a>
        ! Six hundred and sixty-four Marilyn Monroes—including a fair few 'Man-ilyns'—donned their platinum blonde wigs, sweetheart sunglasses, white swimsuits, red lippy, pearls and high heels, and paraded down Jetty Road at Brighton, across the sands and into the sea. But these gorgeous bathing beauties were not just strutting their stuff for the entertainment of the crowds; they were also raising money for cancer research.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Marilyn Jetty Swim was started 11 years go by local Sarah Tenney, after her mother was diagnosed with cancer and passed away a year later. Sarah pledged to raise money to help cure cancer, and the Marilyn Jetty Swim was born. To be honest, I've no idea why she chose this particular event for her fundraiser, but it's gone from strength to strength and it's a keenly anticipated event every year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first Marilyn Jetty Swim had 50 Marilyns participating and raised over $26,000. Having run fundraising, I can say that, for one event, that is a pretty good outcome. Eleven years later, and the number of Marilyns has grown. To date they have raised over $1 million for Cancer Council

        . When you've glamped up as the ultimate platinum blonde, and put on your heels and pearls, you've got to make the most of it. Many of them graced the all-day street party with their presence, posing for photos and blowing kisses. It was great to see them really getting into character. It has to be said: kudos to the Marilyns and the 'Man-ilyns', who kept those heels on all day!
       </p>
       <p>
        This was just one event at fabulous Brighton Beach on that day. Jetty Road was closed off for an all-day street party, with live music, face painting, food truck street stalls and much more. For those looking for something a little more athletic, Brighton Jetty Classic Swims were held on the same day, featuring a series of swims for different age groups up to the 1,500-metre race. I was privileged to be the guest of the Brighton Surf Life Saving Club at their 'thank you' event for volunteers at the Brighton Jenny Sculptures event. This art competition was the brainchild of Brighton surf club, and has been running for 16 years. It's grown from 14 sculptures to a must-see two-week exhibition, with large public art pieces on the foreshore and smaller pieces in the marquees. All the artwork is for sale. There's something for everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boothby has some of the most gorgeous Australian beachfronts, with white sands, sheltered waters, great seaside culture and terrific small businesses, including restaurants and cafes—all a short 20-minute drive from the CBD. Brighton is one of them, and I invite you to come on down.
