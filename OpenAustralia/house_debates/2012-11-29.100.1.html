          Order! I think the nation would be rather disappointed that, when we are talking about one of our cricket greats, you cannot even allow it to be heard. That is just ridiculous. The Prime Minister has the call and should be heard in silence.

            Ricky Ponting

           has announced that he will retire, that Perth will be his last test. This will be his 168th test. That will mean that he is equalling the record of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Waugh" rel="nofollow">
            Steve Waugh
           </a>
           , which is a very important record. It means he is going to go into the next phase of his life with a lot of gratitude and a lot of thanks from the Australian community, full as it is of cricket tragics. It means that people are going to miss watching his performances, but we do wish him well for whatever the future brings.

             Ricky Ponting

            on a superb innings as an Australian cricketer, as an Australian cricket captain, as someone who has given tremendous pleasure to cricket lovers around the world and tremendous pride to Australians who have followed the team's success under his leadership. He is undoubtedly one of the all-time greats of one of the very great games. I might invite, if I may, Madam Speaker, Ricky's local member, Mr Morrison, to say a few words.

I am sure my community would like me to pass on our congratulations and commendations to Ricky Ponting as a great cricketer, a great leader and a great inspiration to young men and women all around the country, including in my electorate of Cook. He is someone that all young Australians can look up to and all sports men and women across the country can look up to. His contribution will continue past his time in cricket and in sport. On behalf of the shire community, I say thank you, Ricky.

                Australian Rules

               player before he concentrated on cricket, having been best and fairest in North Launceston's junior footy for a number of years. He has been a great contributor not only to Australian cricket but to his local community. The Mowbray Cricket Club in Launceston have really benefited from his continued support of that great club. He has also been a great supporter of the
