        My parents lived through the 1955 floods in Maitland. My mother was pregnant; my father was deeply impacted, and he always told us, 'Don't buy on a flood plain. He said, 'The mud and the stench are the things that stick for so long.' I want to acknowledge the fantastic work of the

        and their volunteers. They do a fantastic job for our regionâ€”for all our regions. I am privileged that the northern zone headquarters is in Rutherford, in my electorate. My heart goes out to all those who've experienced loss because of this natural disaster. I also want to acknowledge my colleagues, many of the MPs who are unable to be here with us this week because of this flooding.

        The challenge is so great for many. The disaster has put increased pressure on local economic recovery. Many businesses in affected regions have literally been ruined overnight by the devastation of this disaster. It concerns me that some of these businesses are about to lose JobKeeper. Yes, I know, this scheme was designed to help during COVID. But surely, Prime Minister and Treasurer, you can understand that continued support for these businesses and their staff is vital at this time. I urge the government to make every resource available to the people of

        , who are truly at breaking point. And just remember, Prime Minister: the mud and the stench stick.
