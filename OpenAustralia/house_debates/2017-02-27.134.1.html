       <p>
        The month of February is the month of new beginnings for many children in Chisholm—going from kinder to primary school and indeed from grade 5 to grade 6 or to year 7 in secondary school. Even advancing to the next year level can provide leadership opportunities such as class captain. I had the pleasure and honour of attending many local schools to award school leadership badges and certificates in the last few weeks, first at Mont Albert Primary School. Under the leadership of Mr Jason Walker, the school principal, the students gathered excitedly for their first whole-of-school assembly for the year, which meant it was the first assembly for all the prep students, who had spent the prior week learning the words—both verses!—of our national anthem. These students bellowed out the words of the national anthem together with the older kids on a sunny February morning. It was the quintessential Australian primary school moment. The excitement did not end there but rather a number of leadership awards were made after a quick Q&amp;A session of what leadership meant. In this scenario and in answering questions it did warm my heart to see such young Australians ably and confidently describing leadership as meaning 'responsibility', 'making decisions' or 'taking charge to help and fix things'.

        On the same day I had the pleasure of attending Pinewood Primary School's leadership ceremony as led by Principal Karen Jenkin. Music, flags and a march into the assembly hall gave the event a real sense of occasion as parents and friends, with iPhones and cameras in tow, took photos of what undoubtedly always will be a very proud moment for them. The students were full of excitement and anticipation, and there was a wonderful rendition of our national anthem, which included the background beat of a didgeridoo. The event was indeed harnessed by the presence of proud parents, grandparents and special people who all enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea together. I could see from the faces of every individual child who came up and accepted their badge from me that this was indeed an exciting day for them.

        Then—between running for divisions—I had the pleasure of hosting Mt Waverley Secondary College students in the nation's capital at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . We talked about the leadership of our country by our Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his team and the workings of Parliament House. I look forward to going to Essex Heights Primary School and meeting the principal, Mr Andrew Crossett, and staff and students to present their leadership awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        These events are heart-warming and truly enjoyable. The most inspiring element is how these young students take on the role of leadership so early in their lives and with such passion and energy. Of course leadership does not necessarily come naturally. Rather, students learn what they live with their parents and teachers, so I thank the school communities around Chisholm for providing these opportunities to these young Australians.
