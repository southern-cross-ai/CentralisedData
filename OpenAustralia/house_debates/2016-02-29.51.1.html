       <p>
        Two weeks ago, I visited Peel Youth Services in Canning. It was a pleasure to meet with the executive officer, Be Westbrook, and her team. Be is passionate about caring for young people in their time of need and helping them become ready for the challenges of life ahead. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with the young mums participating in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Open" rel="nofollow">
         Eyes Wide Open
        </a>
        program. The program is about providing teenage and young mums the opportunity to continue with their high school education whilst caring for their infants and children. Coodanup College in Mandurah partners with the Peel Youth Services to give flexible study options to young mums who are juggling the demands of motherhood.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a year tomorrow since they successfully received a five-year tender from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        . This is the longest tender ever received for Peel Youth Services and the stability and confidence that the funding brings enables this important work to continue and expand. From October 2014 to October 2015, 103 mums and 115 babies have been cared for by the program. It was heartening to see mums who love their kids and who are juggling the demands of further education. This government is about supporting people at vulnerable points in their lives and this program does exactly that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend Be Westbrook and her team at the Peel Youth Services on their important service to the community in Canning.
