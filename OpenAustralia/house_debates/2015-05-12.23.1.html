        It is often said that a week is a long time in politics, but I have been wondering today how long the past year has seemed to government membersâ€”a very long time, I would imagine. But my sympathies are not with them and their desperate desire to hold onto their jobs. My thoughts are with the people I represent and the people my friends on this side of the chamber represent, the people who have been affected by last year's budget and let down by the profound breach of trust at its core and also by the substantive impact.

        Today and in recent days, while the Treasurer has remained in witness protection, we have heard the word 'fairness'. It is one thing for government members, the minister and the Prime Minister to talk of fairness, but it is quite another to make things fairer from a government that has dedicated itself relentlessly to driving up inequality in this country. So I welcome the belated recognition by members opposite that the government got it profoundly wrong last year. But I remain concerned and indeed sceptical that mouthing the word 'fair' carries any meaning for government members. I think of the families in my electorate earning less than $65,000 who have had $6,000 ripped away from them, compounded by record low wage growth and by deep cuts to health and education. I say again that mouthing 'fairness' does not make things fair. It is no substitute for a plan for the future, a plan for jobs. That is 'fair',
