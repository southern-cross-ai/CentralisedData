       <p>
        Last Monday I again had the pleasure of visiting a highly successful primary school in the federal electorate of Caseyâ€”the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayswater_North" rel="nofollow">
         Bayswater North
        </a>
        Primary School, where I had the privilege of presenting badges and certificates to school captains and vice-captains and house captains and vice-captains. Bayswater North Primary School is a successful school where the teachers and the parents work hard to go the extra mile to give young students the best possible education at the school. The school principal, Leigh Johansen, and school council president, Glen Bowen, deserve great credit for all they do for the strong school community and the great focus they have on tangible education outcomes, particularly with their constant promotion of reading amongst the young students, especially young boys.

        My visit to the school occurred the day before their interschool swimming sports competition, which was very much a focus of the school assembly. They had won in the past two years and I am pleased to say that the day following my visit, when they competed again with seven other local schools, Bayswater North once again won the competition. They were behind with just a couple of events to go but came through and won the championships. Special mentions need to go to Liam Fowlie, Bethany Arena, Hanna Coward and Dale Ingleton, who all did very well and starred on the day. I am also told that the freestyle and medley 12- and 13-year-old boys team did very well.
       </p>

        Well done to all the students, who have again put a smile on the face of their school principal, Mr Johansen, who, as a passionate
