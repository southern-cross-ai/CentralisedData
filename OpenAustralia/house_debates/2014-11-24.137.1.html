       <p>
        On Friday, 7 November 2014 Narara Public School celebrated its 125th anniversary along with students—past and present—families and teachers. The day was a celebration of 125 years of dedication, commitment and achievement, complete with the nostalgia of the early days of Narara Public School.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school's journey dates back to November 1887, when a formal application for a school was lodged. The initial application was unsuccessful, with the government of the day responding, 'All schoolchildren at Narara can attend at Gosford.' Despite this initial setback, the local residents did not give up. A little over a year later a second application was lodged. Wisely, during the assessment of this application, it was considered that the population of the district, approximately 100 people, was likely to grow. A contract worth 379 pounds was granted to construct the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the school opened in 1889 there were eight students out of a local population of 100. Today the school student population is three times the 1889 Narara population. The current population of Narara is approximately 7½ thousand. In their 125 years, Narara Public School has witnessed much change, not least the relocation in 1998 from the original site in Berrys Head Road to a new modern facility some two kilometres away. This move reinforces the vision of the residents of Narara back in 1887, whose foresight and determination to establish a school benefited not only their children but also the numerous generations to follow. Whilst I was attending the 125th anniversary celebrations, it was abundantly clear that Narara Public School holds a special place in the local community. It was heartening to see so many members of the school community in attendance, many dressed in costumes reflecting the school's earliest days. Their attendance is a reflection of the community pride evident within the Narara Public School family. I would like to thank principal Greg Frohlich, teachers and the school staff of volunteers, whose commitment to their school is equipping our youngest citizens with the best possible start in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school has a rich history, reflecting the changing nature of both the school and education in Australia. For example, the school's original punishment book shows that in 1914 a 12-year-old student was found guilty of nonsense; his punishment was two strokes of the cane. While this trivia highlights the changes of some aspects of our schooling system, the teachers of 2014 are as committed to their students as were the first teachers of the school in 1889. During the school's centenary celebrations, then principal Mrs Carmen Morgan stated, 'The future of our nation lies in our children and their education.' The school's commitment to its students stems from this truism, offering a range of innovative programs including a transitional program for preschool students with learning disabilities to ease them into the big school transition. Education is the greatest gift a child can receive and I am committed to working alongside Dobell's teachers and parents to ensure that our schools are as successful as possible. Congratulations to all involved in organising this celebration of Narara Public School's special milestone.
