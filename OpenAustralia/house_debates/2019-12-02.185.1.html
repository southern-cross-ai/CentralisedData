        It's time to reflect on what a year 2019 has been and to acknowledge and celebrate some particularly favourite moments in my electorate of Wills. In January, I launched the season of the new Fawkner Netball Club, and I'm proud to say that they had a very successful season for a new club. In February, Hakeem al-Araibi, who plays for

        in my electorate, was rightfully brought home to Australia after a very successful campaign, and he's now a citizen of Australia. In March, I attended the biggest ever

        in Brunswick, an annual highlight for the people who live in my electorate.

        , I marched with tens of thousands of workers in Melbourne in support of the Change the Rules campaign. In May, I celebrated the 30th anniversary of the restoration of

        â€”and got re-elected; but we won't mention the national result! In June, I joined local legend Alma Pearce for her 100th birthday party. In July, I celebrated Ramadan and a wonderful iftar dinner at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. In August, I had the honour of rolling the first ball at the Brunswick Bowling Club, and it was a good shot!

        , I visited some of my youngest constituents at the Coburg Children's Centre, for Early Learning Matters Week. In October, I voted to declare a climate emergency in this place and urged the government to take action. In November, I had the pleasure of giving the graduation speech for the year 12 class at Glenroy College.

        And this month, December, I am looking forward to catching up with as many community groups, schools and sports clubs as I can, and go to graduations, presentations and, of course, the Christmas party. I am looking forward to another year of serving the people of Wills in the
