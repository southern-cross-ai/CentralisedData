        Madam Speaker, my question is to you and it goes to your responsibilities as the Speaker. At 1.17 today the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        tweeted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        MP says "why should we listen to industries". Arrogance personified
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is whether or not the member for McEwen was in the chair as the Deputy Speaker at the time that he posted that tweet, and, if in fact he was the Deputy Speaker in the chair at that time, is it appropriate for him to reflect on other members via social media while in the chamber? I would ask you to reflect on that and answer at the appropriate time.
       </p>

        <p>
         I can say this here and now. The standing orders apply to social media and electronic devices just as they do to individuals within the chamber. Therefore, a reflection upon another member which comes from the chamber, if it is brought to the attention of the chair, is out of order. As a reflection on a member it would be required to be withdrawn. What I will do is consider whether or not it was in fact his tweet, whether or not the words that were stated in the chamber by yourself as being at the words that were tweeted were in fact those tweeted by him, and then have something further to say about it then.
