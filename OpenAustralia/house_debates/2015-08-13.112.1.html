        Mr Speaker, this is my first opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to the post of Speaker: well done. Often when we think of Anzac Day, we think of the contribution that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        s make in helping the wider community remember the service of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel, and they do do a great job. But just as important as the older generation's continued contribution to this important task is that of our children. The Anzac Day Schools' Awards are designed to encourage initiative and creativity in the way that schools commemorate Anzac Day, with an emphasis on inventiveness balanced with tradition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I congratulate three schools in Braddon, which have received an Anzac Day School's Award. In particular, Latrobe Primary School, which received the Anzac Day Schools' Award for the grade 4 to 6 students' 3D poppy display and research into the journeys of the Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        soldiers from Albany to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_One" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        battlefronts. I take the opportunity to congratulate all the teachers and students of that school for ensuring that the contribution of all those who have served our nation will never be forgotten. In recognition of the award, Latrobe Primary School will receive a certificate, a winner's plaque and $2,000 prize money, and I congratulate them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further representing Braddon is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph's
        </a>
        Primary School in Rosebery, which was runner up for the Anzac Day Schools' Award for grades 5 and 6, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_Regional_College" rel="nofollow">
         Marist Regional College
        </a>
        , which was awarded a highly commended certificate in the Tasmanian high schools award. St Joseph's is a small school of just 92 students. With the encouragement and support of the entire community, they took a vacant shopfront and turned it into a display for their artwork and research, amongst many other things. It is wonderful to see this young people being engaged in this process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to move on to another matter: the attitude that mobile phone service is a luxury in our community is long gone. It is one of the most basic telecommunication services, on which most have come to rely, and that is no different in the electorate of Braddon. That is why the 2013 election commitment from the Liberals that they would spend $100 million on boosting mobile phone coverage throughout the country was so warmly welcomed. Many areas in my electorate have been covered by recent announcements, but of course we know that there are more black spots. I am so pleased that the government has announced a further $60 million to address this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have already encouraged communities in my electorate to contact me seeking my support for their local black spot to be fixed. One such community is the residents in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Sulphur Creek
        </a>
        , Heybridge and Preservation Bay. These areas are some of the most idyllic locations on the north west and residents are immensely proud of their small towns, apart from one small thing—the poor or non-existent mobile phone coverage. Like residents in other small towns throughout the country, they rely on mobile phone coverage to conduct business, to keep in contact with family and friends, and for emergencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to thank Mr Brian Britt for his work in compiling a lengthy petition of residents. This petition calls on the government to include Sulphur Creek, Heybridge and Preservation Bay in the program. At the end of my contribution, I will table this petition, which has met the requirements of the petitions committee and has been approved for tabling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I again had the privilege to offer the federal government's support to local north-west sporting champions. Local sport is integral to the community and the benefits are felt widely, not only by the sportsmen and sportswomen but by the officials, family and friends. While it is important to focus on the health and community benefit of sport, sometimes people have exceptional gifts in sport and the opportunity to represent their community on the state, national or international stage. This was the case with 16 young men and women that I recently presented with $500 to meet the costs of them competing. In this place, I congratulate publicly: Gabrielle Turley, representing basketball; Caitlin Radford, equestrian; Semra Peach gymnastics; Mia Cooper, hockey;

        These young people do us proud. When they speak at these presentations, they speak well. They genuinely appreciate the support of their parents, in particular, for driving them around—as we know and as we do as parents. They are extremely grateful often for the volunteer efforts of the coaches that provide the experience and the support that they need. I congratulate them in this place for the effort they show.

        I present that petition.
