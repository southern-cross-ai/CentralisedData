        I am moved to rise today on behalf of the residents who live around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Freeway
        </a>
        in Berwick, Beaconsfield and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren_North" rel="nofollow">
         Narre Warren North
        </a>
        in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . The Princes Freeway is an arterial that links Melbourne with one of the fastest growing growth corridors in Australia. The area’s key infrastructure, particularly its roads, are straining to bursting point under the burden of increased population. Nowhere is this more evident than on the Princes Freeway, which over the past decade has seen vast increases in traffic flows and is now effectively a rural highway operating as a suburban freeway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2002 there has been a 40 per cent increase in traffic flow, which has brought with it greater and greater traffic noise. While ordinarily residents are insulated from freeways by either distance or noise barriers and protective mounding, residents in Berwick, Narre Warren North and Beaconsfield are separated from the Princes Freeway by a cyclone fence. Mr Speaker, you and I would be aware that a cyclone fence does not make a good sound barrier—but the Bracks government believes it does. Consequently, residents have to endure a 24-hour cacophony of motorbikes, cars, vans and trucks, and have to put up with vibrations so strong that their homes shake. Despite this dire state of affairs, the Bracks Labor government refuses to act. As long as six years ago,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VicRoads" rel="nofollow">
         VicRoads
        </a>
        acknowledged the need for noise barriers and the Princes Freeway was put on a waiting list. Residents, sadly, are still waiting.
       </p>
       <p>
        I received a letter from the former Victorian transport minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Batchelor" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Batchelor
        </a>
        dated 7 October 2006, which said that noise barriers ‘will be considered by the government for possible future funding’. That is not good enough. This is the same meaningless drivel that the state government has been dishing out to residents for the past five years. This is not something the Victorian government can simply shirk and leave to the federal government. Funding for these noise barriers is the responsibility of the Victorian government. The federal government cannot maintain state roads any more than a state government can collect garbage for councils.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Bracks ought to spare a thought for the Ciavarella family, who live near the freeway in Berwick. On the stifling summer evenings, the Ciavarellas are not able to open their windows because the noise drowns out the television. When it is raining or when the freeway is wet the noise gets louder still. In the family’s backyard, yelling is the only means of communication.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Bracks ought to also spare a thought for the Flemings of Beaconsfield. The conditions there are so bad that they have prompted Ray Fleming to form the Beaconsfield in Casey Residents Action Group, BiCRAG. Over the past five years Ray has done a great job campaigning on behalf of Beaconsfield residents. I should also say that Ray was heavily involved in the Beaconsfield Progress Association and lobbied heavily for the Bryn Mawr Bridge. I again remind the residents of Beaconsfield that the Labor state government—and this was their responsibility—walked away from it and the Howard government picked up the tab. The bridge should be constructed shortly at a cost of $10 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Flemings tell me that the noise in Beaconsfield is so loud that residents have been forced to wear earplugs to bed; homes are becoming caked in pollution; and truck drivers can see right into backyards—some have taken to blowing their horns at people hanging out their washing. What type of privacy is that? What is also of great concern is that some residents, and especially students from the nearby schools, have taken to crossing the Princes Freeway on foot as a shortcut, climbing through holes cut in the fence and dodging the traffic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Incredibly, this ever-increasing level of noise has fallen on the deaf ears of the Bracks government. All the local state members have previously delivered is empty promises. We now have a new state member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren_South" rel="nofollow">
         Narre Warren South

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Graley" rel="nofollow">
         Judith Graley
        </a>
        . Judith assures me that she is working with her new minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Pallas" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Pallas
        </a>
        , and I have no reason to doubt her. I am very keen to work with her to deliver this project for the residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on the Bracks government to commit to the installation of noise barriers on the Princes Freeway once and for all and to restore the quality of life of residents who have been treated like second-class citizens for too long. Enough is enough. This week I also met with
