       <p>
        This afternoon I pay tribute to the life and work of one of the fathers of the Tasmanian wine industry, Graham Edward Wiltshire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . When the early history of Tasmania's wine industry is written, two names will shine out: Claudio Alcorso in the south and Graham Wiltshire in the north. Over 50 years ago, Graham realised the potential of Tasmania's latitude, matching the productive wine regions in southern Europe, and he planted his first vines at Legana in 1966. Eventually he gave up engineering and devoted himself full time to viticulture. In 1975 he established the Heemskerk vineyard and winery. His expertise with sparkling wines became so well regarded that in the 1980s he formed an alliance with the Roederer Champagne House in France, which led to the first Jansz vintage in 1989. It is quite remarkable for anyone to sell champagne back to the French, but Graham Wiltshire did it!
       </p>
       <p>
        He was quiet and gentlemanly and shared his innovation with other fledgling winemakers. He helped form the Vineyard Association of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Pinot Noir Forum and in 2004 was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for exemplary service to the Australian wine industry. His other passion was squash and he was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sports_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Sports Medal
        </a>
        in 2000 for his service to that game. I pay tribute to Graham and express my condolences to his wife Nancy and his family.
