        The men and women who serve Australia in uniform put themselves in harm's way for our country. Our ADF personnel and veterans give Australia their best, so it's vital that in return our communities and nation give them our best. Ex-service organisations like Molong

As a result of these efforts, over 125 new wellbeing support officers are now supporting the New South Wales veteran community. Marc aims to have over 300 wellbeing support officers trained in New South Wales. The Molong RSL sub-Branch has also established the first purpose-designed shopfront in New South Wales to support veterans in western New South Wales through wellbeing and compensation services. Molong's Veterans Advocacy Services is staffed by Marc Matthews, Thomas Squires, Commander Joanna Stewart

        On top of these outstanding achievements for the veteran community, the Molong sub-branch partnered with Molong RSL Club to design and construct an extraordinary memorial silhouette garden commemorating the service of all service personnel—Navy, Army and

The memorial features iron silhouettes depicting Royal Australian Navy Leading Seaman Kane Bird, Australian Army Warrant Officer Tom Squires, Royal Australian Air Force Warrant Officer David Betts and military service dog Sarbi. I had the honour of viewing it on

        Another ex-service organisation in Calare that provides outstanding support to ex-service personnel is the Mudgee &amp; Districts Vietnam Veterans Peacekeepers &amp; Peacemakers Association. The volunteer run group is wholeheartedly dedicated to providing essential support measures like supporting veterans through transitions, helping veterans with their compensation claims and ensuring they get access to entitlements and services such as rehabilitation and wellbeing programs. I'll give a big thankyou to president and legendary advocate, trainer and mentor

President Ken Atkinson is currently mentoring two trainees in the Mudgee area and six others across the state to ensure more veterans and their families will be empowered to improve their health and wellbeing, stay well and age well. I would like to thank all veterans for all they have done for our country and all local ex-service organisations for providing vital support to our veterans and their families.
