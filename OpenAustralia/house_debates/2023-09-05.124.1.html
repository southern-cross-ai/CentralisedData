        Last Saturday I had the privilege of attending the third annual Ladybird Care Foundation gala dinner. Some 550 guests packed into the grand ballroom at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Hall
        </a>
        to celebrate and to honour the precious children who have left us far too early and to 'say their name'. All the funds raised on the night will go directly to the Ladybird Care Foundation's peer mentor program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ladybird Care Foundation was established in October 2020 by Wayne and Maree Pascoe after they lost their daughter. From a very early age, Emma Louise Pascoe was officially known as Lily Ladybird. Emma had an incredible impact on her friends and family, with her infectious, cheeky character and her stubborn determination to live life to the fullest despite her disabilities. Her family were blessed to have 18 medically miraculous years with their daughter and sister. However, as Emma grew, her heart weakened, and on 2 November 2014, exactly one month after her 18th birthday, Emma's heart was no longer able to sustain her and she passed away.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not wanting other parents and families to experience their grief journey alone, Wayne and Maree became passionate about finding a way to help others. When Wayne's core group of friends suggested they set up a charity in honour of Emma, they knew this was their new purpose in life. Thus the Ladybird Care Foundation was launched in honour of their Lily Ladybird. The Ladybird Care Foundation is part of Emma's legacy of love, hope and healing that will live on well into the future. I want to thank the community's leaders and founders, Wayne and Maree Pascoe, Colin Ginger, Greg Beech, Michael Delport and Craig Barke. No-one should have to bury their child.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were also privileged to hear from guest speaker Jay McNeill, who told the wonderful story of his daughter Sunshine from her early premature birth to living life to the full in the best way that she could with a wonderful family. The Ladybird Care Foundation peer mentor program evolved in response to a call from bereaved parents seeking to meet a peer with lived experience. This includes highly qualified bereavement care professionals who actively recruit, train and supervise volunteer peer mentors with the lived experience to become the human connection for support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you again to everyone who attended and assisted in raising money for and awareness of this incredible cause. To the generous sponsors who donated prizes, thank you. I want to give a particular shout-out to general manager Wendy Collins and her team for putting on a wonderful event. Thank you for the work you do for our community.
