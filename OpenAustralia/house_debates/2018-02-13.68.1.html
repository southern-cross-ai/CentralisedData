       <p>
        Thank you Mr Speaker. My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. I refer to the coalition government's budget papers and the final budget outcome document. Is the infrastructure minister aware that the difference between what was promised in each of the budget papers and what was actually invested in Queensland's infrastructure is $1.0289 billion? How does the minister explain this over one billion dollar cut in real terms just in Queensland's infrastructure; and how many jobs for Queenslanders would have been created had this investment actually occurred and not just been promised?

          I thank the honourable member for his question, and note that, in equity and grant funding, the coalition has spent far more than the Labor Party ever spent in any year. He mentions Queensland, and I'm happy to go through some of the investments that are happening in Queensland. Obviously, there is the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Bruce Highway
          </a>
          , and the $6.7 billion which we're putting towards that, of a total funding of an $8.5 billion project. We're also noting the M1 Pacific Motorway, where we are putting $225 million towards a total funding of $402 million, and the Gateway Upgrade North, where we are putting in close to a billion dollars, $914.2 million, towards a $1.142 billion project. There is the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing; this is something that is vitally important to the member for Groom and was also fought for by the former member for Groom,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Macfarlane" rel="nofollow">
           Ian Macfarlane
          </a>
          . What we're seeing there is about a $1.1 billion investment by the Commonwealth, with close to, I think, a $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion final cost. There is the

           Warrego Highway
          </a>
          upgrade. We were out there the other day with the Prime Minister, seeing $508 million of Commonwealth money going to a $635 million project. The member for Grayndler also—
