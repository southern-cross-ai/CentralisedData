        Today I want to acknowledge the great work of men's sheds right across

        , as we celebrate national Men's Shed Week, from 4 to 10 September. The 2022 campaign promotes 'A global village, doing local good,' highlighting all the immeasurable benefits that both members and communities gain from these places of connection.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first want to acknowledge Peter Bettes, who's not doing too well at the moment. He's got a serious health issue that's not looking good, but Peter has been instrumental in bringing together the states and the national Men's Shed Association. He should be acknowledged for that great work, because there's been a lot of politics played, but he's been a shining light. I just want to thank him for that, particularly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men's sheds, no matter where you go across the electorate, are putting in hours and hours delivering great good, and it's great that I could again co-chair the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Sheds. In the first day, we had 51 responses from people wanting to come in, because members know that men's sheds are vitally important for men's health and for community growth through the great work they do in bringing communities together. I think about one area, Lancefield, where they bring all the schoolkids in and teach them basic woodwork. That not only teaches these kids valuable skills but breaks down the barrier between older men who are out in the street and the kids. They're able to go up and talk to each other and say hello and work together. Men's sheds are so important. Every MP should be involved in this movement. The time for us to celebrate this might be only one week, but we should be celebrating the work that men's sheds do each and every week of the year.
