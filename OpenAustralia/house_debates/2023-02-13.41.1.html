       <p>
        The cost of living is the issue for the people that I represent. It is issue No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and all the way to 100. I want to bring to the attention of the House the School Savvy program, run by CatholicCare
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQ" rel="nofollow">
         CQ
        </a>
        . Nothing demonstrates more how difficult, how tough, it is for people out there right now than, firstly, the need for this program and, secondly, the overwhelming demand for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        CatholicCare CQ's School Savvy program provides affordable school supplies, second-hand school uniforms and free haircuts, would you believe, Madam Deputy Speaker, at pop-up shops during January. In

        <i>

        , the local newspaper, on 16 January, Shari Jackson from CatholicCare said 'the number of people who accessed the service was a reflection of the tough financial pressures that many families are facing'. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'In the first half of the week alone we had 1000 people—
       </p>
       <p>
        a thousand people accessed this service in my local region. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'Budgets are stretched and lots of people are needing to find savings wherever they can.'
       </p>
       <p>
        So I say to those opposite: this is the issue. There is no other issue. People cannot afford to pay their bills. The cost of electricity is not going down; taxpayer funded subsidies are going up. That is the difference. We need to see real change and we need to see it soon. The people I represent know that you will always—always—pay more under a Labor government.
