        The government has launched, as we know, the Go Local First campaign. That's really all about helping the economic recovery post COVID. There's nothing better that any Australian can do than choose to buy from a local small business this Christmas. No matter where they are in your communities, please support your local small businesses. If you buy and sell locally, you keep local jobs. That's what I think all of us in this place are supportive of. We all know those small and family businesses are the backbone of our economies and the backbone of our small communities. They contribute a third of Australia's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        and almost half of the workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wonderful thing in my part of the world, and, I think, in everybody's part of the world, is that these small family businesses often offer our children and young people their first job, and, when we're very mature—that's a really nice word!—they often offer us our last job. They're always there in our community, as we saw during COVID. It was small local businesses and local people looking after other local people and making sure they had the items they needed during COVID.
       </p>
       <p>
        Please not only do that but, if you're going to buy a gift of wine this year or consume some wine—in the right way, of course—make sure it is an Australian wine. It's a great gift. In my part of the world, the south-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , some of our wines—like wines from many parts of Australia—are some of the best in the world. So I really encourage people to buy Australian wine.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank local businesses that stayed open and provided key services during COVID. It was a great challenge, but they did so. It was local people, as I said, looking after local people. So please support these same small businesses now when you're doing your Christmas shopping. Go back to them and say, 'I need to buy from you.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Quickly I want to thank our farmers and transport workers who, during COVID, made sure that the food was on the shelves, even if there were some logistical challenges that we saw with some of the panic buying. Our transport workers and farmers just kept making sure that the food and the supports were there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally I want to really thank all Australians for their patience, for their courage and for their kindness to each other during what has been a challenging year. We've seen that kindness repeatedly in each of our communities.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ask every Australian to stay safe on the roads. We have got more people on our roads now than ever, and we will see that accelerated so much during the Christmas period. Give yourself plenty of time. Keep your lights on. Make sure the trucks can see you. Stay safe online. Have a happy Christmas and a great 2021.
