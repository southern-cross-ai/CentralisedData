        , so I thank you for your indulgence in allowing me to speak a second time, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was speaking in my earlier contribution about Investing in Our Schools. During the break from parliament I had the pleasure of attending four separate IOSP project openings, all of which will add immeasurably to the quality of infrastructure in the schools concerned. Students at the Givelda State School are now protected from the harsh Queensland sun thanks to a new shade shelter over the playgrounds, which was made possible by a grant of $6,565. The shade shelter has been installed above the school’s play equipment so that the children can use the equipment all year round and be protected from the harsh elements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Bundaberg State High School has used its $27,000 grant to install air-conditioning in its resource centre, which will make life far more bearable during the summer months. The school’s resource centre is one of the most used rooms in the school. Before this project, temperatures there could rise as high as 40 degrees. The students at Bundaberg East State School have benefited from a $25,000 grant, topped up with a $7,000 grant from the school’s P&amp;C, or the school itself, which will be used to upgrade computers. I have always thought it is important that students be familiar with the use of modern technology—and not just with iPods and mobile phones. To get the most out of education, they need to be able to use computers expertly. Information technology is part of everyday life and it is important that students keep up with technological change, which is exactly what the new school computers will allow them to do.

        The great thing about this whole program is that it fills that gap between what the state government can provide, on one hand, and where sometimes there is a shortfall in the capacity of the cash-strapped P&amp;Cs on the other. I would also like to compliment the Sandy Strait State School, where I represented my colleague the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        in commissioning the school’s $42,000 new playground equipment. I must also compliment the school on a most impressive set-up in putting $23,000 to it themselves.
