        provides awards for the citizens of the year for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        . I don't envy them the task, because the nominations are all amazing and my congratulations go to all of them. But I would like to acknowledge the major award winners.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Citizen" rel="nofollow">
         The Citizen
        </a>
        of the Year for 2020 is Geoff Phillips. Geoff has marked 50 years working in media and radio. He is a well-known face on out local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , but he has also done so much work with the Steelers, the Hawks and in supporting local charities. He was very moved by the award.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amazing Val Fell, 91, is the Senior Citizen of the Year. She has worked tirelessly as a dementia advocate and she volunteers with the City of Wollongong Eisteddfod, the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre and the Council on the Ageing. That is a very well-deserved award. And Ian Steven Muhayimana was the Young Citizen of the Year. Ian uses music to raise awareness of men's mental health, and that is very well received.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge that there were many other recipients of a wide range of awards, all of whom have contributed enormously to our community. I'm sorry I can't name them all, but I offer my sincere congratulations. As I said, I don't envy the committee choosing the Wollongong citizens of the year because the amazing efforts made by so many community members across our city make it very, very difficult. The three recipients I have mentioned today are entirely worthy winners of those awards.
