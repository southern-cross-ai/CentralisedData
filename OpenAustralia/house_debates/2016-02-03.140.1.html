        I would like to acknowledge Ken Jolley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Ken was made a life member of the Lismore
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        in 2001 and the Lismore City Council Citizen of the Year in 2011. He is a Vietnam Vet and he is a tireless worker on many causes in our community, not least of all the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westpac_Rescue_Helicopter" rel="nofollow">
         Westpac Rescue Helicopter
        </a>
        . Ken, congratulations on your OAM. Your family—Kerry, Tracey and Scott and their families—are proud of you, and so is your community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tracey, I knew before you did. Just a story about this: on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        , Ken was not there to receive his award. I went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Evans Head
        </a>
        later in the day for an Australia Day celebration and there was Ken selling raffle tickets for the Westpac Rescue Helicopter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spiro Notaras has been awarded an OAM for our community. Spiro was an iconic figure in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley
        </a>
        , both in the business and wider community. On Australia Day this year, less than three weeks after his death, Spiro was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . Spiro was aware that he was getting this award before his death, which is very fitting. He loved Grafton and he loved the wider Clarence community. Spiro, you are missed already, and this award is celebrated by the whole community for the amazing contribution you made over many decades. Thank you.
       </p>
       <p>
        When RSL stalwart Raymond 'Jack' McDonough from the Kyogle RSL Sub-Branch was told he was he was to be honoured with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        , his first reaction was 'I am flabbergasted. You don't do it for acclaim, you do it for your community.' That off-the-cuff remark sums up Jack. He is all about community. He served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Army Reserve
        </a>
        for 36 years and the 41st Battalion, located in Lismore. He has a long resume of serving in important community volunteer roles, primarily with the RSL—far too many to mention. I want to congratulate Jack on his award. His children, his whole family—Kim, Leah, Mia, Grant and their families—are proud of you, Jack, and so is your community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to mention and congratulate Warren Tozer, who was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia, for his unrelenting work in the local community at the recent Australia Day ceremonies. Warren has been intrinsically involved in several community organisations including the Grafton District Services Club, the Helping Hands Committee, of which he has been a member for the past 20 years, and the Westpac Rescue Helicopter, of which he has been chairman for 18 years. He was humbled to receive the OAM; he told a local newspaper that he believes it is more recognition of the organisations; but, Warren, I would like to say that is right, but it is also a recognition of your outstanding and inspiring commitment to our community. I know that Rhonda and your children, Brad and Jo-anne, and their families are very proud of you, Warren, and so are we.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge Jan Clifford who was honoured the Order of Australia award in Lismore on the Australia Day Awards. Thank you.
