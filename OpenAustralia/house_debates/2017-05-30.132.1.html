        It is with great pleasure that I stand before you to talk about someone who I have had the pleasure of working very closely with and to talk about their contribution to Western Australia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberal
        </a>
        state government led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
         Colin Barnett
        </a>
        has the legacy of one of the most successful governments to lead WA. It was a government of integrity, a government of principle, an ethical government, free of the inaction and scandal that dogged the former Labor government in WA—inaction and scandal that saw Labor ministers sacked or resign for their improper use of high office. The Barnett government was a team of skilled and talented ministers that led reforms in a great number of portfolios over the 8½ years from 2008. They are reforms that have shaped Western Australia in mining exploration, job creation, health, education, law and order, and infrastructure investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Barnett's influence on WA politics is much longer than his time as Premier. He came to the WA parliament in August 1990, winning a by-election in Cottesloe after the resignation of former Liberal opposition leader Bill Hassell. A former economist and executive director of WA's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he was promoted very quickly into the shadow cabinet. In opposition he held the portfolios of housing, works, fuel, energy and state development. Mr Barnett was elevated to the position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Court
        </a>
        in the lead-up to the 1993 state election and was deputy leader, minister, leader and Premier from that time until the recent election—24 years in the WA Liberal leadership team.
       </p>
       <p>
        He began his ministerial career after the Liberals defeated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Lawrence" rel="nofollow">
         Carmen Lawrence
        </a>
        in 1993. He spent time as opposition leader from 2001 to 2005, and a defeat of the Carpenter Labor government brought him to be the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of Western Australia
        </a>
        . As Premier, Mr Barnett's agenda was to take WA to the world, in partnership with the federal government and in the interests of WA first. WA led by Colin Barnett capitalised on the rise of Asia. Their middle-class boom, extraordinary population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation became WA's success. Our mineral resources and construction and mining expertise were in palpable demand. Huge projects like Gorgon, Wheatstone and Pluto fuelled a massive expansion of the state's economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Barnett government backed exploration and project expansions to keep the state competitive. Within this decade,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        production trebled to make Western Australia the world's second largest LNG producer, and iron ore production more than doubled. Western Australia will continue to dominate Australia's exports. On Colin Barnett's watch, WA's asset base grew by 55 per cent and more than 98,000 jobs were created. Mining royalties were invested in infrastructure to support and foster our economy. Ports, roads, rail, freight regulation reform and payroll tax exemptions for apprentices and trainees meant that government did its part to support business and jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the expansion of WA, workers and families moved to our state—450,000 people moved to our state over those 8½ years. With our newest sandgropers came challenges. Twenty minutes could no longer be the norm for getting anywhere in our city. But
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        s welcomed the massive population surge and dealt with it well. WA built job-creating infrastructure to look after everybody—roads, rail, hospitals and schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mining aside, Barnett also personally took on the science and later tourism portfolios as he looked to diversify WA's economy. Agriculture, tourism, education, health services, science and innovation remained a focus of the Barnett government. Again for WA, the driving force was Asia, with vast populations wanting access to quality agricultural produce and first-class education and health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government expanded agricultural production through the development of the second stage of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ord_River" rel="nofollow">
         Ord River
        </a>
        project. Irrigated land in the Ord is producing chia, sorghum and millet for export to Asia. With the assistance of the state government, many Western Australian food producers began to make solid inroads into Asia, exporting products like: chilled, frozen and processed meat; live cattle and sheep; and honey.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is easy to forget that Colin Barnett took over the premiership following the global financial crisis. But in 8½ years Perth City and Western Australia has transformed. Colin Barnett was a statesman for Western Australia and a statesman we were very proud to have on the international circuit representing our state and our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The WA Liberals rebuilt our health system with: a $7 billion health asset program which modernised our healthcare system; new hospitals such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Stanley_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Fiona Stanley Hospital
        </a>
        , the Midland, Albany and Hedland health campuses and the new children's hospital soon to open; and major redevelopments at Joondalup and Busselton health campuses and also at Kalgoorlie Hospital. In total, 61 hospitals and health facilities were built or upgraded. Health spending was increased overall by 80 per cent. Disability spending increased 120 per cent. Spending on and investment in mental health grew. WA nurses were the highest paid in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        On our transport infrastructure, the Barnett government focused on the needs of our population due to the boom. They completed the Gateway project. They sunk the rail line between Northbridge and Perth. They extended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Freeway
        </a>
        to Hester Avenue and commenced Roe 8. They extended the railway line to Butler. They commenced the Forrestfield Airport Link. They built train station car parks. Hundreds of kilometres of bike paths were constructed across WA and free public transport was introduced for seniors.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is on education that I know Mr Barnett is most proud. The Barnett government built 56 new schools. They introduced the independent public school model, allowing greater autonomy for schools to determine their own needs. The Barnett government managed the successful transition of year 7 students into high school.
       </p>
       <p>
        On crime, the Barnett government: boosted police numbers by 1,050; introduced mandatory 75 per cent of the statutory maximum sentences for serious and sexual assaults committed during a home invasion; and introduced mandatory jail sentences for assaults against police, ambulance officers, transit guards, court security and prison officers. Tough anti-graffiti laws have seen an 88 per cent decline in graffiti offences. Tough hoon laws resulted in 2,028 vehicles being impounded in 2015 alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Barnett government also revitalised Perth through investment in Elizabeth Quay, the Perth City Link, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Cultural_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Cultural Centre
        </a>
        , the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Stadium
        </a>
        and a new museum, on which construction will start soon. These projects will be recognised as more significant as time goes by. But find me anyone who has visited Elizabeth Quay who has not enjoyed the experience. When Perth's No. 1, nightly news bulletin changes their opening credits to include a twilight shot of Elizabeth Quay, you know we have quickly come to love it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Find me someone who cannot wait for the new stadium to be opened to watch the derby. Find me someone who does not have a story of the first-class health services at our public hospitals, including Fiona Stanley Hospital in my electorate of Tangney. Find me someone who does not feel safer with an extra 1,000 police on the streets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our state now is very different to when Colin Barnett first became Premier in 2008. Every Australian can remember what our state was like in 2008—or can they? When I was state director, working with Barnett as opposition leader, we ran a television commercial that asked Western Australians to nominate three things that the previous Labor government had achieved in Western Australia. The reason we ran that election commercial was that people could not name three things that the previous Labor government had achieved. The same cannot be said for Colin Barnett and his government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Colin Barnett and his government have transformed Western Australia. It is no longer 'Dullsville'. Investment in priority areas was needed after Labor's underinvestment and to deal with the challenges of rapid population growth. Some 450,000 additional people came to call WA home under Colin Barnett's watch, but the quality of our services were maintained at high levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a honeymoon period for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGowan" rel="nofollow">
         McGowan
        </a>
        and the Labor government, and I wish them well. The new Premier is keeping his hi-vis, hard hat and golden scissors in the back of his car, because not a day goes by when he is not opening a completed project that was designed and commissioned by the Barnett government. I do wish the McGowan government well. I am sure they will soon learn that opposition is an easier place than government. In government decisions have to be made—decisions like supporting jobs that will be created through Roe 8 and Roe 9 in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Barnett served during the terms of five Australian prime ministers, three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        presidents and three British prime ministers, and through all that time he remained committed to the people of Western Australia. I thank him for his commitment and service to the people of WA, supported by his wife, Lyn, and his family. Over time, history will be rightly generous about the time and commitment that Mr Barnett gave to the people of Western Australia. Colin Barnett's wisdom and steadfast leadership should be a playbook for leaders inside and outside of politics. I wish Colin Barnett well.
