        from Goondiwindi. It is hard to imagine that not that long ago Goondiwindi's iconic and historic Victoria Hotel would have been flattened if not for the vision and passion of Michelle and John Klein. In fact, before the couple took over the pub, the council said if it wasn't bought it would be bulldozed, and a tavern with an arcade and shops was going to be built. What a great loss to pub history if that had happened. This month, not only did 'Kleiny' win the individual award of hotelier of the year, but his Victoria Hotel won best traditional hotel bar and best pub style accommodation. This is the second year in a row the hotel has won both awards.

        Rural pubs are the core of so many communities, where stories are told and friendships are forged. They often become living museums as their owners become curators of the region's history, with relics all saved within the walls of the beloved country pub. Congratulations to Michelle and John, and all their staff at the Victoria Hotel. How did 'Kleiny' celebrate the victory? He gave his staff a bonus because they deserve it. What a champion!
