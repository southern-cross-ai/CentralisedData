        My question is to the Prime Minister. On Monday, 39 Liberal MPs voted against the Prime Minister's leadership. On Tuesday, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Minister
        </a>
        failed to explain the Prime Minister's minute-to-midnight submarine deal. On Wednesday, the Treasurer insisted the government is sticking to its unfair budget. And today, the Prime Minister has refused to acknowledge his list of broken promises. Prime Minister, f this is what the first week of good government looks like, how bad is next week going to be?

         Madam Speaker, I am the first to admit that we went through a difficult few days at the end of last week and the beginning of this week. I am the first to admit that.

           But I am proud of what this government has achieved in its first 16 months. We said we would get rid of the carbon tax—the carbon tax is gone. And every Australian household is $550 a year better off. We said we would get rid of the mining tax—the mining tax is gone. And Australia's reputation as a safe place to invest has been restored. We said we would stop the boats—and haven't we stopped them! And as result of stopping the boats, hundreds of people are no longer dying at sea—and 1,800 kids who were in detention under members opposite are no longer in detention.
          </p>
          <p>
           We said we would deliver on the trifecta of trade agreements—the big three: China, Japan and Korea. Sixty-one per cent of our merchandise trade is now covered by these free trade agreements. What that means is that the vast majority of our exports will enter those markets with a great competitive advantage against their rivals. And do you know what that means? It means more jobs for Australian workers. It means lower prices for Australian consumers. And it means more markets for Australian exporters. That is the trifecta of achievement that this government has managed. And members opposite fiddled their thumbs and argued with the unions and worried about green clauses—and one thing and another—and did nothing for six long years. They did nothing about this—just like the six long years they did nothing to sort out the submarine tender.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a government that, wherever you look, is doing the right thing by the people of Australia. You look opposite and what is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition? Bring back the carbon tax, bring back the mining tax and bring back the boats. You look opposite and what do you see? You see a Labor Party, which was the most incompetent government in Australia's history, that has learnt nothing—and they cannot change. You look opposite and you see a Leader of the Opposition completely untrusted by the people who know him best and who have worked with him most closely. The distrust between Rudd and Shorten was intense and enduring.

             The Gillard camp was contemptuous, considering him weak and duplicitous. Neither side touched him, and neither side revised its view. This man is utterly unworthy of ever being a candidate to govern this country. On that rather magnificent note—if I may say so myself—I ask that further questions be placed on the
