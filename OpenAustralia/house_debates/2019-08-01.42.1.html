       <p>
        Last week, I attended a fundraiser at the Burnie Yacht Club in my electorate of Braddon in order to raise funds for prostate cancer. The organiser was Mr Brian Britt, who was ably assisted by his daughter Melissa. Brian himself is struggling with an aggressive type of prostate cancer. As we appreciate in my electorate of Braddon, the business community got right behind Brian and donated some amazing prizes for the auction. It was a great night, and thousands of dollars were raised. Brian was inspired by the success of this fundraiser, so once again he got together with his family, his neighbours and his friends, and they're now chopping wood and selling it in order to raise further funds. His vision is to fund a prostate cancer bus to move around the state and assist in the education program.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 3,300 men are expected to die of prostate cancer in Australia this year, a staggering statistic. Brian's message, and indeed my message, is simple: blokes, have a regular blood test to measure your

         PSA
        </a>
        because, if you're a candidate for prostate cancer, the earlier you treat it, the better the outcome will be. In just a few weeks, Brian and his helpers have raised around $30,000 towards their cause. I congratulate him on his tremendous effort. Brian, you're making a real difference in raising the profile of this terrible disease and raising much-needed funds to educate others.
