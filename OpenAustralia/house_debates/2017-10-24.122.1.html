        In my region, we are coming to the end of our show season. Our agricultural shows are a great celebration of all that our region has to offer. An important part of the shows is the showgirl competition. I want to acknowledge some of the entrants in those competitions in the shows in my region. I would like to congratulate the Casino Showgirl winner, Kaela McRae, the runner-up, Zoe Griffiths, and the other entrants, Sarah Lynn and Brooke Hewitt. The Miss Teen winner was Dakota Wadsworth, Miss Junior was Jessica Cruickshank, Miss Mini was Sam McLennan and Miss Tiny Tot was

        I would like to recognise three organisations in my community which were recently recognised in the Resilient Australia Awards. I notice the member for Richmond is in the chamber as well. Our region was hit very hard by a flood in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie. I would like to acknowledge three organisations who got these awards. One was the Lismore Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who did great work. The executive put together some very important public meetings to get us all focused to make sure we got category C funding and got money into the area, working with both me and the state member,

        . I'd also like to acknowledge Lismore Helping Hands, who set up an amazing organisation in south Lismore. The other one I want to focus on is the Casino Red Cross, and I'd like to congratulate the executive, Betty Braithwaite, Barbra Thorley, Carrie Kennedy and the whole team, on their 'Get in the Know' emergency services forum.
