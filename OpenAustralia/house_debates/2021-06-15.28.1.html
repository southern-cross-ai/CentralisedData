       <p>
        Parramatta is mourning the passing of Neil El-Kadomi
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Quite frankly, it's hard to imagine Parramatta without him. He has made a very real difference. He has left an extraordinary legacy of friends and family, and he will be missed. He was one of the founders of the Parramatta Mosque, and he was its president for many years. I remember working with Neil as he fought so hard to get the approval for that mosque in Parramatta. He established one of the first local community language schools and taught Arabic and Islamic studies to generations of local Australian children, a legacy well and truly worthy of our respect.

       <p>
        He came to Australia as a Palestinian refugee in 1969, and he's always been there for refugees and migrants in our community. He served in many, many community organisations and he made a big contribution to interfaith dialogue in Parramatta. Wherever there was an interfaith service, Neil was thereâ€”at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , at the Buddhist temple, at the Baps temple in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Harris Park
        </a>
        . Wherever there was an interfaith service, Neil was there, representing his community. I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to spend time with him one last time, when he hosted me for Friday prayers the week before his passing. Neil leaves behind his wife, Ameera, seven children and 19 grandchildren. His loss will be deeply felt in our community, where he has given so much to so many.
