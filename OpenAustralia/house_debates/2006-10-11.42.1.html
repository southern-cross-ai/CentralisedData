        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister update the House on how reforms to the labour market allowing employers and employees more choice have strengthened the economy? Is the Prime Minister aware of any proposals to roll back elements of this reform and what is his response?

         I can inform the honourable member for Canning that the progress so far under the new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         legislation—and it is just over six months, so it is relatively early days—is a lot better than we were told by the Labor Party would be the case. Since Work Choices was introduced, over 117,000
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
          AWA
         </a>
         s have been signed.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_September" rel="nofollow">
          In September
         </a>
         , over 27,000 AWAs were signed, which was a 46 per cent increase on the average uptake per month in 2005. Additionally, over 1,000 employee collective agreements have been signed since Work Choices began, covering over 48,000 employees, and there have been 800 union collective agreements signed, covering over 240,000 employees. But most important of all, despite the predictions that the world would come to an end, the sky would fall in, there would be mass sackings, wages would be slashed and generally there would be a pestilence all across the land, what has happened is that 175,000 new jobs have been created.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Canning asked me for my response. I think I can say that is my response—but, more importantly and more interestingly, what is the response of state Labor governments to the policy of the opposition leader to tear up workplace agreements? I know that the Premier of the state from which the member for Canning comes,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , made it very clear when he was in China with me in June of this year that he was not the least bit interested in following the Beazley policy of tearing up Australian workplace agreements. He leads the largest mining state, if I can put it that way, in the country and he knows the critical importance of Australian workplace agreements to the mining industry of Western Australia. He knows they need those workplace agreements to get maximum choice and maximum productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
         But this—how shall I put it?—recalcitrant trend amongst state Labor governments has now spread to Victoria. Yesterday, Mr Hulls, a senior minister in the Victorian government, was asked on seven occasions whether he supported the Beazley policy of tearing up AWAs, and he refused to do so. Listen to this for a disingenuous reply from a state Labor minister—a disingenuous reply. This is what he had to say. The Victorian industrial relations minister, on seven occasions, refused to endorse Mr Beazley’s policy, and he included in his refusal the following words: ‘Look, I haven’t got exactly the quotes that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
          Kim Beazley
         </a>
         said, so I don’t exactly know what he said.’ I do not think we are in any doubt. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, went to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         conference in June in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and he said, ‘I will tear up AWAs; I will tear up the government’s workplace agreements legislation.’ The truth is that Labor governments, faced with the need to cooperate with the business community of Australia, do not want a bar of the Beazley policy because they know that policy would be anathema to the future prosperity and development of this country.

          My question is also to the Prime Minister and follows on from his answer to the previous question. Isn’t it the case that yesterday the Victorian Minister for

                I thank the member for Deakin for his question and reiterate to him and to the House that this government is committed to providing both employers and employees with the flexibility to choose suitable employment agreements for their workplaces. I was asked about any specific examples. I was interested to read last night that

They did that, as was shown yesterday, without establishing the facts of the case whatsoever. They accepted the spin of their union masters in this case and launched an unwarranted attack on Australian business.

                                  There is another interesting fact that, again, the member for Perth was totally unaware of. They say that it is bewildering that although the union has been ‘appointed bargaining agent for several of our employees, they have not made any contact with our office to discuss any issues regarding the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">

                                  That is too true. So we have had the member for Perth sink the boat of his skipper yesterday. He ought to have the decency to apologise not just to this House and to the people of Australia; he ought to have the decency to apologise to this company and their 43 employees. It is no wonder—I will finish on this note—that business in Australia has no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition and the

                                          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: relevance. This question was about whether or not the workers had sought a collective agreement and whether he was aware—

                                            It is amazing how, having come in here yesterday, the member for Perth wanted to detail a whole series of facts to prove he was right. As soon as I raised the facts that proved he was absolutely wrong, he wanted to run away, and the Leader of the Opposition is trying to save his sinking ship. He said there was no pay increase. In fact, there was a 10 per cent pay increase over two years—5.5 per cent in the first year and 4.5 per cent in the second year. He said that payment of overtime is at the sole discretion of the employer—again, wrong. In the conditions of employment, it says, ‘Overtime will be paid for at the rate of time and a half for the first three hours and double time thereafter’—set out in black and white in the conditions of employment.

                                            He said:
                                           </p>
                                           <p class="italic">
                                            Under the collective agreement, there is a tool allowance of $12.50 a week.

                                           <p>
                                            Under the current collective agreement there is a tool allowance of $12.50 per week. There is no separate tool allowance in the current collective agreement. He said, ‘Under the current collective agreement, there are electrical certification allowances and

                                            registration allowances payable each week.’ In fact, they have only ever been payable on the occasion when the employee was qualified in that regard. So, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, and they are just four of the matters raised by the member for Perth yesterday.
                                           </p>

                                            On the substance of the question, I go back to the statement by
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Donnelly" rel="nofollow">

                                            . He says: ‘We want either a non-union agreement or an

                                            . In fact, under our AWA, employees are going to be around $150 a week better off and I cannot see what people are complaining about. The workers obviously are not.’
