        , Southbank and so many others are dedicated to their families and their work and they are generous and passionate about our community. They are studying, working hard, raising families and living in our local community, adding so much. But, increasingly, through the many conversations that I'm having throughout my electorate, one thing that is clear is that people are finding it pretty tough at the moment.

We have a lot more work to do, but we are listening, we are acting and we are ensuring that hardworking Australians can get by in these difficult times.
