       <p class="italic">

        (b) the current system of Commonwealth grants administration means grants can be awarded based on the discretion of ministers and against official departmental advice, without merit and without meeting the aim of promoting proper use and management of public resources; and

        (a) clear requirements for published Commonwealth grant guidelines and selection criteria;
