        Queenslanders with school-age children or grandchildren know that school holidays kick-off this Friday. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_State" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine State
        </a>
        is a huge place and many families will be hitting the roads over the holidays, visiting family or getting away for a magnificent Queensland winter holiday. What that means is more traffic and that people will be driving longer and further, often on unfamiliar roads and in unfamiliar conditions. So, please, if you're hitting the roads these holidays, follow a few simple rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plan your drive, give yourself plenty of time to get where you're going and remove those temptations to speed. Include a stop or two along the way to stretch your legs and give your kids a chance to get out of the car. Always drive to the conditions. Luckily, Queensland is usually free from frost and icy roads—unless you're around Stanthorpe—but there might be fog, rain or localised flooding, or kangaroos or livestock on the road, so please slow down and drive to the conditions. Put your mobile phone well away—put it in the glove box or the boot, removing that temptation while you drive. Think of the fines. Think of the safety. Think of your family. Buckle up. Make sure you and all of your passengers are wearing seatbelts properly at all times, especially in the remote parts of the state. Don't drink and drive or take drugs and drive. Be aware that both of these can stay in your system long after you think they have gone. Lastly, to avoid the inevitable 'Are we there yet?' questions, make sure your kids have plenty to keep them busy on a long trip. I recommend Animal Spotto, and people in my electorate can email my office if they want an Aussie Animal Spotto tele sheet. Follow these seven tips, and let's ensure all Queenslanders return home safely these holidays.
