        by leave—I move Greens amendments (1) to (3) together:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 4, item 3, page 22 (lines 32 and 33), omit "the disclosure threshold", substitute "$1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 4, item 3, page 23 (lines 1 and 2), "the disclosure threshold", substitute "$1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Schedule 4, item 3, page 24 (lines 14 and 15), "the disclosure threshold", substitute "$1,000".
       </p>
       <p>
        The intention of these amendments is to enshrine the $1,000 disclosure limit for donations during referendums. We think it's a sensible policy. It's one that was actually announced by the Labor Party and it will only see the Labor Party fulfilling their promise on donation disclosures. We ask the government to support the amendments.

         </small>
         <p>
          The government opposes these amendments. It was the great Labor prime minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
           Bob Hawke
          </a>
          who first introduced a funding and disclosure scheme into federal elections in Australia in the 1980s with a $1,000 threshold. Regrettably, under former prime minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           John Howard
          </a>
          , the Liberal government increased the threshold to $10,000 and indexed that figure, causing it to blow out. Think about this—every member of the House should think about this—the current disclosure threshold is $15,200.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Labor Party has been pursuing donation reform for years, including from opposition, when we introduced legislation to reduce the donation threshold to a fixed $1,000. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
           Special Minister of State
          </a>
          , Senator Farrell, has already asked the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to consider and report back on the proposal of a fixed $1,000 threshold for elections. Any such change would then be replicated in the context of a future referendum under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act. However, pursuing such a proposal now would not be practical or sensible. We do not wish to add any additional or unanticipated administrative challenges or confusion in the months immediately preceding a referendum. That's why we're opposing this amendment, although the government looks forward to working with the Greens party and others on its electoral reform agenda.

            These amendments seek to prevent misleading and deceptive advertising in the upcoming referendum campaign. These amendments, which will prohibit misleading or deceptive political advertising and referenda advertising, are a practical, popular and proven way to clean up our politics. They approach the regulation of political advertising with caution and respect for our constitutional freedom of political communication.

            They are also urgent. We live in a world where our democracy is under attack from disinformation. A vote based on lies and misleading information lacks social licence and divides our communities. It lacks legitimacy and erodes trust in election results. As Brexit demonstrated, referenda are particularly vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation. In his review of every Australian referendum,

            last year recommended enacting truth in political advertising laws to protect the legitimacy of the referendum. Social media companies, such as Facebook, have voluntarily removed misleading and deceptive advertisements from their platforms, based on advice from the

            Almost three-quarters of Australians came across false political advertising during the 2022 federal election campaign. Australians were relentlessly targeted with

            advertising making all sorts of wild claims. We should have protections against this type of attack in advance of the referendum. Nine out of 10 Australians want truth in political advertising legislated in advance of the next election. Really, in this context, the 'next election' will be this referendum. We should have these protections in place to have a debate grounded in facts that the public can rely on.

             The government will be opposing these amendments. They are amendments that seek to introduce a truth in political advertising regime into the referendum machinery legislation. The framework proposed by the amendments that have been moved by the member for Warringah appears to create an offence of printing, publishing, distributing or authorising referendum matter that purports to be a statement of fact that is 'misleading or deceptive to a material extent' or is 'likely to mislead or deceive to a material extent'.
            </p>
            <p>
             As has been clear from the debate on this bill, the intention of this bill is to bring the referendum machinery legislation into line with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Electoral_Act" rel="nofollow">
              Commonwealth Electoral Act
             </a>
             . Australia has not had a referendum since 1999, and the referendum legislation needs to be updated in line with modern electoral machinery. The government intends for voters to have an experience at this upcoming referendum that is consistent with their experience at the last federal election. This amendment would introduce a new element beyond this intention, in effect a new framework that has not yet been tried and tested at a federal election.

              Special Minister of State

             , Senator Farrell, asked the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to consider and report back on the potential for truth in political advertising laws to enhance the integrity and transparency of the system. After the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has deliberated on this matter and reported, the government and the parliament will be in a stronger position to consider how a truth in political advertising framework could be applied to Australia's federal elections and to referendums. That's the time in which the parliament should be considering this kind of proposal, after the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has reported.
