        Along with probably most members in the room and indeed the other chamber, I see that the drug ice is becoming more of an issue in all of our communities. About 12 to 18 months ago when I was starting to talk to a lot of our front-line healthcare workers, our front-line police and our welfare agencies I was quite taken back by some of the stories that they were telling me about how not only their safety but indeed the safety of drug addicts was an issue. Although the number of people using this drug is not necessarily high relative to the number for some other drugs in our community, certainly the impact of this drug is quite large.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March of this year I asked the Assistant Minister for Health,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Nash" rel="nofollow">
         Fiona Nash
        </a>
        , to come to my community. While she was there I invited her to speak to some of the people that I have been speaking to, including obviously front-line police, front-line health workers, welfare agencies et cetera. She had obviously been aware but some of those discussions and others she had around the country encouraged her, along with the federal government obviously, to establish the National Ice Taskforce. As part of that they held community forums around the country. On 19 May of this year Senator Nash again came back to my community and as part of the taskforce held a forum which hundreds of people from around the region attended—people like the front-line healthcare professionals from emergency hospital departments, front-line police, welfare agencies, addicts including some who were recovering, their family members and many other people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been to other local forums too around the community in Kyogle and Yamba. At the Yamba forum I ran into a man called Patrick, who is a recovering addict who has not used for about three to four months now. He showed bravery in sharing with that forum and the community his stories—the effect that the drug has had on his life and what he is now trying to do. I am starting a group for recovering addicts and family members because the extended family are very affected by this. I am holding a support group meeting on Monday the 24th of this month in Grafton. Patrick is helping me to put this together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The forums that were held obviously encouraged the federal government to note that they need to act at our level as well. They are looking at six areas in the interim report focusing on: law enforcement actions, obviously in relation to the dealers; primary prevention, and obviously education is important; early intervention, treatment and support services; supporting local communities to respond, and we have some great local community events; things that are helping front-line workers; and consolidated research and data.
