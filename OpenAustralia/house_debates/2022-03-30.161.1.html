        I'm pleased to provide the House with an update on two substantial federal funding commitments in the areas of health and education which will directly benefit all

        ns and, in particular, my constituents in Moore. In October last year, I rose to make a strong merit based case for a significant federal funding contribution towards the development of a comprehensive cancer care centre in Western Australia. In the months following, members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        parliamentary Liberal team worked diligently behind the scenes to secure the necessary funding to make this project a reality. I'm pleased to inform the House that, on Sunday, the Prime Minister visited Perth to announce that $375 million in federal funding has been committed to enable the Harry Perkins Institute of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to deliver a comprehensive cancer care centre in Perth. This will benefit the estimated 55,000 of my fellow Western Australians battling cancer, including many living in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The benefits of having a comprehensive cancer centre based in Perth include improved patient survival and quality of life through improved access to the latest drugs via clinical trials. Total cancer care will be provided in one convenient place, including diagnosis and treatment, imaging, pathology, surgery, radiotherapy, oncology, haematology, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, exercise and wellness treatments. The facility will also foster world-class translational research that attracts the best clinicians and researchers from across the world. I thank the Prime Minister for listening and responding to the needs of Western Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, more than two years ago, I informed the House of the vision by

        </a>
        . Following strong advocacy by WA Liberal team members and senators, the Morrison government initially announced $245 million in federal funding for the project. However, cost escalations have necessitated an increase in funding. I'm pleased to inform the House that the Prime Minister visited Perth earlier this month and committed a further $49 million in funding, bringing the total federal funding contribution to $295 million.
