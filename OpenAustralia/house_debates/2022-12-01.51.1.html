        I rise today to add my voice to the millions of Victorians who have congratulated

        and the Labor team for their thumping election victory. This election was hard-fought and hard-won by an amazing group of people committed to a better future for all Victorians. While we wait for the count to be completed, it's still possible Labor may come out with 'Danslide 2.0' to match the 'Danslide' of 2018. 'Danslide 2022': who would've predicted that?

        I'm very pleased to report to the House that some very strong Labor women will be taking state seats across our communities in

        . Although she didn't get there, it was an amazing effort by Angela Tough in Euroa. She took on a very formidable opponent and did extremely well. These candidates faced some of the worst opponents the election had to offer. They faced hate, lies and vitriol, but they prevailed. We knew the other side chose the wrong guy and it turns out the people of Victoria agreed with us. So they once again threw their votes behind Labor, because Labor does what matters.

        As the Premier said on Saturday night, Victorians have not been divided, as some would like you to think. In fact, we've been unitedâ€”united in our faith and our care for each other. But also we have seen hope triumph over hate in the greatest state in this nation. I congratulate all those who worked so hard to make this victory a reality.
