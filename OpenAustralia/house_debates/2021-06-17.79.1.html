        My question is to the

        . Fewer than three per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated. The government has failed to meet any of its vaccine targets. It failed to secure enough vaccine deals. There's uncertainty about the health advice and, in Sydney, people are driving around foreign air crews who haven't been vaccinated. The government had two jobs this year: to roll out the vaccine, effectively, and national quarantine. Why has it botched both?

         Throughout this global pandemic, the Australian government has acted on the advice of the medical experts. We've acted on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, we've acted on advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and we've acted on the advice of professors

         On the last point that the opposition leader made, is he seriously suggesting that we make the jabs compulsory? It is voluntary—

          He has asked the question. We want to encourage, obviously, all Australians to get that jab. It is so important. It is absolutely critical. Indeed, over the last seven days 731,660 people have got the vaccination; over the last eight days, 874,468; and over the last 10 days, 1.1 million. More than 60 per cent of people over 70 are protected with a first dose. More than 40 per cent of people over 50 are protected with a first dose. More than one in four of the eligible population aged 16 and over are protected with a first dose. In aged care, all 2,566

          To the opposition leader's point about the transport worker: we are happy to look into this particular case. Indeed, I'm happy to take any more information if the opposition leader has it. But the

          state government has been the gold standard by which contact tracking and tracing has occurred. It has made every measure and effort to keep New South Wales safe. Indeed, that is how they have kept their state safe, just as we have ensured that we have kept this country safe. We're doing this in the most practical, responsible way, listening at all times to the best possible medical advice.
