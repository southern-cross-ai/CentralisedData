        I want to bring to the attention of the House two issues of importance to my seat of Solomon—Darwin and Palmerston in the far north. On Friday I visited Jingili Primary School, which is in my electorate, and I promised young

        , a student there, that I would take his message direct to the Prime Minister. I do so now: JD says, 'We need more funds for our primary school.' With $70 million cut out of education in the
