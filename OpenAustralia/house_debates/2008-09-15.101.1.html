       <p>
        I recently had the opportunity to attend the opening of the Family Relationships Centre Coffs Harbour. I was delighted to receive an invitation to that opening and pleased to see the Attorney-General in attendance. Family relationship centres are a very important part of our social fabric going forward. Unfortunately, the tragedy of family breakdown is all too common in all of our electorates. I am delighted that the current government has continued this very fine program that was initiated under the watch of the previous Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to attend to the issue of family relationship breakdown at an early stage. Early intervention is the key in such matters, rather than getting to the court stage. If we can head off litigation and if we can reduce the pain of family breakdown, we can provide a much improved outcome for not only parents but most importantly children, and that is what all this is about. Family relationships centres will mean better outcomes for children and a strong society. I commend the government for continuing what is one of the really great programs that was instituted by the previous government.
