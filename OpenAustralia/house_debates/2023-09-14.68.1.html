        is getting left behind by this government. If the $5 billion of infrastructure projects that are on the chopping block get ripped away, we will have been abandoned by this infrastructure minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opposition members: Shame!
       </p>
       <p>
        It is shameful. One of the largest projects includes a rail link to Western Sydney international airport. Imagine that. The rail link that has been years in the development, years in the planning, that the coalition government invested in, could be ripped away.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a pity that the minister fumbled through her answer in question time yesterday to the member for Fowler about this particular project. She didn't even get halfway through her time. This is the contempt that has been shown to the people of western Sydney, to the non-Labor members in this House from Western Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is unbelievable that it is not just one project in my community of Lindsay that adds up to $5 billion and could potentially be ripped away; it is a number of projects: two Mulgoa Road updates that our community has been desperate for for many years; two commuter car parks at

        and Kingswood; and funding for roads surrounding the new airport. My community needs better from this government. We need answers. We don't need things dragged out. The minister needs to respond.
