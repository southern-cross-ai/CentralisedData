        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has claimed his office's only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was to pass along information. So why has the Audit Office told the Senate today that there were 136 emails about sports rorts going back and forth between the Prime Minister's office and Senator McKenzie's office in under six months?

         Neither I nor my office were the decision-makers in the process that governs the sports grants program. The decision-maker was, as has been rightly identified through the Audit Office processes and other reviews, the former sports minister. As I actually stated at the

              I will just ask the Leader of the Opposition to resume his seat. As you know, I listen very carefully to the questions. I believe the Prime Minister's completely in order because of the preamble that said 'claims his office was only involved in' et cetera. The Prime Minister, essentially, reiterated that at the start of the answer and is now elaborating on that very point.

               On the point of order, Mr Speaker, the first part of the question did go to his office's and the Prime Minister's claim he was passing on information. As for the members, the member for Lindsay wasn't elected at the time! That's one of the members who has just been mentioned, and that's why this—

                     I'll just say I heard the Leader of the Opposition very clearly. He essentially reiterated the point he'd made in his question about the scheme. I've studied that very carefully, because he's gone very close to the line—leaned over it, almost, a couple of times—but not crossed it, in some of the motions. But I'm saying to the Leader of the Opposition that he made the point himself about what the first part of the question said. If he doesn't want the Prime Minister to address that, he shouldn't have had it in the question. But it doesn't mean that you can stand up on points of order and start trying to correct what you see as factual matters. You can do that in other forms of the House. The Prime Minister has the call.

                      Mr Speaker, I'm happy to take the Leader of the Opposition's interjection, because what I know about the member for Lindsay—even if she wasn't in this place—is she knew what was right for her community. And guess what, Mr Speaker?

But on our side we understand that people who have a deep understanding of their community are in a very good position to advocate.

Ministers who've been asked about alternative policies today have been at pains to point out that they've been asked about alternatives. This is not an opportunity to go beyond the subject matter that was in the question.
