       <p>
        I'm really pleased today to join my Victorian Labor colleagues in congratulating the Andrews Labor government on their return. They are set now to deliver for another four years for Victorians. Like my colleagues, I want to congratulate the party and the broader movement on that victory, but I want to deeply thank the electors of Victoria, who've returned a government with a vision, a government that sees what needs to be done and sets about getting it done, a government that has worked on a first treaty in our country for our Indigenous communities, a government that held a royal commission into domestic violence and a government that is fearless in its approach to social issues.

        The opposition in Victoria went to an election this weekend with no statement on education. This was unbelievable. As a result, Victorians saw through that opposition and saw that they could not form a reasonable government that was going to deliver for people in my electorate of Lalor. When I'm talking to people in Lalor, those are the things that matter to them. They care about social issues. They care about the environment. They care critically about education and health. They want a government that is going to do the best for their families. I'm pleased to congratulate the Andrews Labor government and to congratulate
