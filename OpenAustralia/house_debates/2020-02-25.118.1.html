I recognise also the great efforts of the Barzani Charity Foundation, which donated 10 pallets of bottled water for bushfire affected communities. Furthermore, I thank Australian Islamic House and Human Appeal Australia for visiting bushfire affected areas and offering assistance. They provided much needed supplies from their generous food donations.

        Whilst this was one of our worst environmental disasters, it nevertheless displayed some of the best qualities in people and in the community. These generous community efforts are clearly the embodiment of the great Australian spirit.
