       <p>
        I am here today to acknowledge the efforts of a few inspiring community members from my electorate of Stirling. Local resident Jackie Percy and her sister Sharon El Wakil have been able to raise almost $20,000 and gain support for autism after a successful crowdfunding campaign. Jackie's son Ned was diagnosed with a severe type of autism at just three years of age. As a result, he is completely nonverbal and relies on sign language, grunts, picture cards and anything else he can find to let them know what he is thinking. After a long wait, Ned was finally accepted into the Smart Pups Assistance Dogs program, which allows him to be paired with a specially trained service dog—a puppy that will grow up with him and be his companion in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        These dogs, however, come at a very large cost, and Jackie and her sister Sharon have been fundraising for her son's autism ever since. They have set up an online fundraising page, including a blog giving insight about Ned's condition to members of the community. Their determination has seen them hold pop-up restaurants and quiz nights. Both have been very well received by members of the community and the family has been able to raise almost $20,000 in a few short weeks. I acknowledge not only the efforts of this family but also the generosity of the individuals who support such a deserving young boy. It is a privilege to have such a loving family in my community who are continually striving to achieve their goals. Their success is a testament to their hardworking attitudes and they are outstanding role models for all members of the Stirling community.

        Secondly, I would like to congratulate aspiring young basketballer 15-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Emma Clarke
        </a>
        , who received a $500 Local Sporting Champions grant through my office so she could compete in the under-16 Australian Junior Basketball Championships held in Tasmania in July. Emma is an enthusiastic sportswoman who spends more than 16 hours per week attending basketball training sessions with four different teams, including Western Australia's under-16 state team and the State Basketball League. In January, Emma underwent a series of trials in order to gain a position in the competitive team. Her hard work, dedication and enthusiasm towards her sport paid off and, as such, she made the trip as a player—and as the captain.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with Emma a few weeks ago and she told me of her experiences representing her state at the national level. At only 15 years, Emma has a dedication to her sport that is to be admired by all, describing herself as being 100 per cent committed and giving everything a go, no matter how hard the situation may be. She describes basketball as her passion and says life would not be the same without it. Her experienced gained at the national level has strengthened her resolve to take her basketball as far as she can. She hopes one day to be invited to the Australian camp and attend the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is great to see such inspiring young sporting members of the community represent their state with such passion and enthusiasm. I am pleased that her hard work has paid off and I wish her all the best for future events.
