       <p>
        As a great supporter of the arts and in the wake of the government's new National Cultural Policy, I want to speak about how regional arts are so often delivered. It's mostly done by locals and wonderfully creative and artistic people like Jamie Lea. Jamie is a young woman in my electorate who, from the age of 15, has had a hand in so many musical, cultural and art events in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of her signature events is the Secret Garden Gig. I've hosted and played at one such event. I did a version of Radiohead's 'Subterranean Homesick Allen', for those who are interested. Another event was in a disused quarry in a choir singing 'Solid Rock' by Goanna in front of a sheer cliff of solid rock, celebrating a real spirit of place. This is what Jamie does. She brings people together and gives a platform to artists. She does this because she loves what she calls her 'village', Greater Shepparton, the place that raised and nurtured her. And what an amazing dividend the village gotâ€”a highly energetic champion of the arts who lifts so many people up through an opportunity to perform.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are told the National Cultural Policy includes more funding for the regional arts. I hope it does. I hope it facilitates more work from people like Jamie Lea, people who have the capacity and commitment to bring arts and culture to their village and continue to inspire their communities.
