        Since the introduction of the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4187" rel="nofollow">
         bill
        </a>
        some issues were identified that require clarification. These technical amendments do not alter the policy intent of the bill. They are designed to improve the operation of the bill and reduce potential complexity. In relation to the expanded definition of ‘substantial interest’, the bill captures new forms of foreign investment transactions that configure future rights and interest to a foreign investor. Some rights are structured so the actual number of shares or potential voting power cannot be determined until these rights are exercised. For example, where a convertible note relates to shares equivalent to a specified monetary amount the number of shares and voting power attached to that instrument would normally depend on the value of the shares at the time of the conversion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments clarify that all rights over shares will be treated as having been exercised at a particular point in time—for example, when the agreement is entered into—or at the time a decision is made under the act. The act currently provides for regulations to be made to disregard certain prescribed types of interests in shares. We will shortly introduce regulations to ensure only currently held shares and voting power are counted when determining if an investor is a foreign person or foreign business and must notify under the act. This means investors can more easily monitor their foreign shareholdings to know when to notify their acquisitions under the act. Companies may not be able to determine the ownership, foreign or otherwise, of all rights to the future shares and potential voting power given the characteristics of derivative instruments and the way they may be traded off market.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments ensure regulations may be made with respect to prescribed provisions of the act such as the compulsory notification provisions. The act provides tracing provisions to enable substantial interests to be traced through the ownership of structures of relevant entities. The amendments ensure these provisions are applied consistently. The act also requires acquisitions or options to be notified only once—that is, at the time of the acquisition. The amendments provide that this also applies to other types of rights over shares or assets to make clear that a second notification is not required at the time the rights are exercised. Since the bill applies retrospectively, from 12 February 2009, transitional provisions are included so that foreign persons will not have committed an offence for failing to notify acquisitions of substantial interests in Australian corporations which would have been subject to compulsory notification by virtue of the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments ensure that acquisitions of urban land will also be covered by the transitional arrangements. Full detail on the amendments is in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The amendments do not change the national interest framework nor the screening arrangements of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I am confident the amendments help to modernise Australia’s foreign investment framework while providing certainty for prospective investors.
