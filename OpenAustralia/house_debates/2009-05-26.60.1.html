        Public School parliament, which celebrated its 20th official opening on Friday, 22 May. This is truly an amazing achievement. It recognises the commitment of the school community as a whole in ensuring the parliament is an ongoing success.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tea Gardens Public School parliament was established following a visit to Canberra 22 years ago. The staff at the school were keen to implement a parliamentary system to give the students a voice in implementing change at the school, which continues strongly today. The school parliament, which is based on the Westminster system, is highly valued and well respected by the students, staff, parents and the wider community. The ‘Prime Minister’ and the ‘ministers’ have designated roles and responsibilities and are supported by the ‘Governor-General’, the principal; the ‘senators’, the teachers; and the parliamentary advisor.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school parliament plays a significant role in implementing change at the school. Simply put, the voice of the children is listened to and acted upon. The parliament sits each fortnight, and ideas, motions and questions are put to the student members for discussion or vote. Each year the students receive their badge of office from the current Tea Gardens/Hawks Nest Lioness Club Citizen of the Year at a special school leaders induction service. The Tea Gardens Public School parliament has been a model for many other schools in setting up their own parliaments and is an outstanding example of student leadership within a school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to report to this parliament that the 2009 school committee is: Prime Minister, Sky Boonon; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Building and Health, Lachlan Hole; Minister for Special Events, Candice Cotterill; Minister for Transport, Ray Finch; Minister for the Environment, Jessica Treacy; Minister for Education,

        , Ryan Howarth; Deputy Speaker, Lauren McCaul; Serjeant-at-Arms, Ethan Schloeffel and Alex Bartholomew; Usher of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rod" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Luke Fenner; Hansard reporters, Taylah Cooke, Kant Richardson and Kiarna Eddy; and Parliamentary Advisor, Ms Annette Benton, who has been in that position for the whole of the 20 years the parliament has been established. And, of course, the principal, Sue Estens, is the Governor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motions that were put to the Tea Gardens Public School parliament at the 20th official opening of parliament were: (1) that the school get games to use during wet weather lunches, such as Twister and other board games—that was carried; (2) that the school set up a ‘Bully Bank’ where bullies are fined and the money given to charity—carried; (3) that the school get speakers put in every classroom so the principal can say messages to classes and she does not have leave her office—carried; (4) that we get new play equipment for the younger kids—unfortunately defeated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the parliament, the Senate—the teachers—meets to discuss the motions that were carried by the students. Some of the more memorable motions from the past 20 years have included: that we do 30 minutes of exercise a day at school; that we don’t have to tuck our shirts in; that the canteen sells stationery; that we raise money for a professional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for the year 6 farewell social; that the art area gets fixed; that the school get some new sports equipment, including pogo sticks; that we start soccer practice early so we have a chance to win; that we are able to go down the back at afternoon recess; that the school get a toilet down the back; that teachers should not be able to keep children in at lunch time; that the school get an alarm down the back; and that each classroom gets a telephone in case there is an emergency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students have some great ideas. However, sadly, not all their motions are passed in the Senate—that is replicated here. I would like to acknowledge that the inaugural Prime Minister in 1988 was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Hall
        </a>
        , followed in 1989 by Olivia Meek. In 1990 at the first official opening, the Prime Minister was Anya Cole and the Governor-General, the principal, was Daryl Martin. Even though Daryl Martin has been retired for some time now, he has managed to attend all of the official Tea Gardens Public School parliament openings. What I observe at each and every parliament opening that I have been able to attend over the past 13 years is that the children are well behaved and that they speak with unbridled passion yet with absolute respect for their peers. I congratulate the Tea Gardens Public School parliament on achieving its 20th official opening and 22nd year of operation.
