        I rise to speak about the scourge of the ice epidemic. As a former criminal lawyer, I saw firsthand the devastation of this evil drug. It is a drug that does not discriminate, with people of all ages and all backgrounds potentially at risk of having their lives destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I applaud the leadership shown by the Prime Minister in creating the National Ice Taskforce.

         Murray Bridge

        , Millicent and Naracoorte, to name a few. Each forum has confirmed that ice is ruining individual lives, destroying families and hurting communities.

        I pay tribute to Sergeant Paul Scicluna who was the 2014 South Australia Police Officer of the Year—awarded particularly for his work to reduce the harm of drugs like ice—and other members of the Limestone Coast Drug Action Team. I also wish to acknowledge those members in the northern areas of my electorate who are doing excellent work around the Riverland Community Service Alliance.

        The story of 'Riley', not his real name, from the Riverland forum, was particularly heartbreaking. Riley was 14 when his dad gave him a bag of methamphetamine and told him, 'Here, have that. I don't need it, I've had too much.' His drug use grew to the point where he involved himself in crime. Thankfully, he has ameliorated the effects of the drug and his life is on track. 'Lola' was another who said that the drug was destroying her from the inside. On one occasion she fell over when she was high, knocked herself out and nearly choked to death on her own vomit.

        Whilst the story of the ice scourge is an ugly one, it has caused communities to come together to battle this evil and to deal with the insidious groups that pedal this misery. I congratulate the Prime Minister and the coalition for going about dealing with this scourge, not just via the National Ice Taskforce but also with other practical measures that are being announced, including a $1 million boost to
