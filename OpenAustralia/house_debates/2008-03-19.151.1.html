        I would like to draw the House’s attention to a story of bravery and compassion that has touched my local community in Stirling. Frazer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLennan" rel="nofollow">

        , who is a year 7 student at Yokine Primary School, tragically lost his mother to breast cancer last year. Last Friday, surrounded by his family, his friends and his classmates at school, the 12-year-old shaved off his red curly hair in tribute to his mum, who had lost her own hair whilst in chemotherapy. Frazer had joined thousands of people around Australia—including in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , I understand—as part of the World’s Greatest Shave to raise money for the Leukemia Foundation. He had much support and admiration from his family and friends, teachers, classmates and sporting team-mates. Frazer initially had wanted to raise $1,000. I am told he has already raised in excess of $3,000 for the Leukemia Foundation, and donations are still coming in as more and more people hear about his story.

        I have not had the opportunity to meet Frazer yet, but I am looking forward to doing so when I return to Perth at the conclusion of this sitting week. Certainly he has warmed the hearts of many in Stirling. He has kept an online diary during this time and he writes in that online diary that he is 12 years old and that he lost his mum to breast cancer last year. He talks about how he remembered that she used to lose her hair due to chemotherapy, and how much it had meant to her when she did lose her hair. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am cutting my hair this year to remember my mum and to help out other kids who have leukemia. All my T-ball, soccer and school mates are supporting me. Could you please support me as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story received some media attention in Perth, and that of course has led to an influx of donations. That is brilliant because this is a very worthy cause. If you look at the website that Frazer established, he received many, many messages from members of the community. It is great to see that when people in my community of  Stirling see somebody doing something for the good of that community they are prepared to rally around them and give their support. The principal of Frazer’s school, Yokine Primary School, Mr Neil
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCallum" rel="nofollow">
         McCallum
        </a>
        , said that the event was a very moving occasion for students, teachers and parents, with more than 150 attending the shave last Friday during lunchtime. I congratulate Mr McCallum, the other teachers and the students of Yokine Primary School who got behind Frazer while he was pursuing this worthwhile cause. Mr McCallum said that some of the money had been raised by students actually guessing the weight of Frazer’s flaming curly hair once it had come off. And if you see a photo of Frazer you know that he had a tremendous lot of hair that he sacrificed in support of a very worthy cause—so I congratulate him. I just want to draw that event to the parliament’s attention.
