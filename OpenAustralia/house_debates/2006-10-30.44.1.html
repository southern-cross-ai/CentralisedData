        My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the security situation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        ? Will the minister also advise whether Australia will continue to lead the international security forces in East Timor?

         First can I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. There were some serious security developments in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         over the last week. The international forces, led by Brigadier Rerden, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         police have brought the situation under control. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         and the international security forces as well as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Police because it is dangerous and difficult work that they have had to do. As at lunchtime today the situation in Dili was calm, but there is still an underlying tension. The unrest was caused by clashes between rival gangs near the airport and in other isolated pockets around Dili. We are concerned that this violence may be organised in some instances for what might broadly be described as political reasons. The timing of the violence could be linked to the release on 17 October of a report by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Special Commission
         </a>
         recommending action be taken against a number of people whom the UN believe to have been responsible for the violence that took place in April and May.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am able to confirm reports that at least six people have been killed and another 50 have been injured since last Wednesday and note with concern reports that drugs have been used to fuel gang violence. I welcome the commitment by the United Nations Police to investigate this matter. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully and keep our travel advisory under constant review. At the moment it advises Australians to reconsider their need to travel to East Timor, at least for the time being, because of the uncertain security situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are around 1,000 Australian troops in East Timor. As I have said, they are doing an excellent job to keep violence under control. Any suggestion that the Australian troops have been anything less than professional and impartial in carrying out their duties is wrong, and it is ludicrous. I welcome the consensus decision by the United Nations
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         last Friday that Australia should continue to lead the international security forces in East Timor. That decision by the Security Council is consistent with the preferred position of the Australian government. I also note that last Friday East Timor’s Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Ramos_Horta" rel="nofollow">
          Jose Ramos Horta
         </a>
         , reaffirmed his government’s total support for the work being done by Australian troops in restoring law and order. He said it was ‘logical and necessary’ that East Timor accept the assistance of its neighbours in providing troops to stabilise its security and that that was—and I quote him again—‘in the best interests’ of East Timor. So we will remain committed to the task in East Timor through to the general elections, which are scheduled to be in May 2007 and, no doubt, beyond.
