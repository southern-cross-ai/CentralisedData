        I rise to acknowledge the efforts of three active groups in my local community. Residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Orchard Hills
        </a>
        have formed the group Residents Against Industrial Dump to campaign against a proposed industrial waste facility at the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Erskine Park
        </a>
        quarry at Patons Lane, Orchard Hills. The proposal is currently before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state government. I am opposed to this proposal because of the adverse impacts it would have on our local community. If this waste facility proceeds it will result in hundreds of additional truck berthings, the possible disturbance of asbestos already on the site and, ultimately, a 30-metre-high bund wall to contain the waste. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the members of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID" rel="nofollow">
         RAID
        </a>
        for organising their community to oppose the application, and I would like to thank Mr Dirk Kurver for alerting me to this proposal. RAID are holding a public meeting on 8 June. I will be attending and I encourage all local residents who have concern about the proposal to go along. While the federal government has no direct influence on this process, I know that the local community has the support of the

         Penrith City Council
        </a>
        in opposing this, and I would like to acknowledge the strong advocacy of Councillor Prue Guillame, who has been keeping me updated on this matter.

        Last Sunday I was honoured to take part in the 2010 Walk for Autism, organised jointly by the Luke Priddis Foundation and Little by Little Inc., the fundraising arm for Kurrambee Special School.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walk" rel="nofollow">

        for Autism raises money for both organisations, which in turn support families who have children with autism and other special needs. Around 400 people participated in the five-kilometre walk around the

        </a>
        on Sunday morning on what is now an annual event. I participated in the walk with my family, and it was wonderful to see so many members of the community coming together to support this event. I would like to congratulate all of those at the Luke Priddis Foundation and Little by Little, who worked so hard to raise funds and provide valuable emotional and material support to so many local families.

        The Barnardos Western Region Auxiliary recently celebrated its 21st anniversary, and I joined the group for their commemorative dinner at the lakeside restaurant. The auxiliary is composed of dedicated volunteers who work with the staff at Barnardos on their many programs. The volunteers assisted the Barnardos centre at Cranebrook to collect food from donors, distribute emergency parcels to vulnerable families and run some of the social activities that support the local community. It should also be said that their barbecues at the annual Barnardos centre open day are legendary. One of their most important roles has been in raising funds for Barnardos. Over the past 21 years the auxiliary has raised $100,000 for the organisation, and this money has gone to purchase equipment and support the activities of the Barnardos centre. The auxiliary are also out in the community, promoting the fantastic work of Barnardos, and their network of businesses and other community groups has helped them to rally a strong supporter base for Barnardos. I take this opportunity to thank the volunteers involved in the auxiliary. For 21 years they have been working hard to help others and they should be congratulated for their commitment and dedication.
