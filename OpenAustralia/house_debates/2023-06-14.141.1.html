       <p>
        I rise today to shine a light on a fantastic community based charity, Whitsunday Foodbank. We all know that Aussies are doing it tough, families are tightening their belts and the cost of living is going through the roof. Outside the Canberra bubble we see every day how the cost of living is nipping at the heels of thousands of Australian families. With interest rates continuing to climb and electricity and gas bills skyrocketing, for many families the cost of groceries is becoming unaffordable. Aussies are proud people. They work hard, but, through no fault of their own, they are drowning in these costs and are now reaching out for a helping hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's where an incredible local organisation comes in, an organisation that I want to give a big shout-out to, Whitsunday Foodbank. In recent weeks I attended the opening of the new Whitsunday Foodbank branches, in Mackay and Proserpine. Providing a hand-up, not a handout is Whitsunday Foodbank's motto, empowering our most vulnerable people to purchase their own groceries, offering them good-quality food at a more affordable price. And with more Aussies forced to turn to organisations like food banks than ever before, their role in our community has never been so important.
       </p>

        Under Labor's created cost-of-living crisis, the Australian way of life is fast coming a nightmare. In Dawson many families are forking out up to $1,100 more each month to pay their mortgage. A staple item like a loaf of bread is now over $4 for most brands, and it is easy to find some of our major brands of cereal at over $10 a box. The cost of necessary items like personal hygiene or feminine hygiene product are starting to become unaffordable. It is for this reason that I am so grateful to the team at Whitsunday Foodbank who offer the most essential products at discounted pricesâ€”for example, a box of milk for a gold coin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whitsunday Foodbank is available to pensioners, concession cardholders and healthcare cardholders. For food banks to offer this incredibly important service they need donations and volunteer support, so whether it be funds, food or volunteers, all donations are greatly appreciated. As we know, volunteers are the backbone of our communities, and I want to say a huge thank you to all the Whitsunday Foodbank volunteers who give their precious time to help our most vulnerable. To Jeff and Judy Boyle and family and to Christine and Vicky and all the volunteers and support crew, I say thank you for providing such an important service to Dawson. Your hard work and dedication do not go unnoticed.
