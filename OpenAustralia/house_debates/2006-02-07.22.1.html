        My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House on Australia’s efforts to help the people of Pakistan following last year’s earthquake?

         I thank the member for Herbert for his question and outstanding representation of the 3,500 Defence personnel in Townsville. With the possible exception of the Prime Minister, they have no greater advocate. On 8 October last year an earthquake struck Pakistan with devastating human, economic and environmental consequences. On 9 November last year the Prime Minister announced the deployment of approximately 142

         personnel to Pakistan. They are currently based at Dhanni, about 20 kilometres north-east of Muzaffarabad. I would also point out that they are working in very difficult terrain and in subzero temperatures as low as 20 degrees below zero Celsius. They have treated 8,200 Pakistani people with life-saving medical and surgical treatments. They have also rebuilt a school in the area where they are working. The four S-70A

         helicopters that have also been deployed are enabling the health care team to provide services in the region beyond Dhanni, where they are actually based. We are extremely proud of the fact also that about a third of those who have been deployed are reservists. I would pay particular tribute to the nursing and medical staff who are reservists who have left not only their families but their practices to provide a practical illustration of Australian Defence Force personnel working seamlessly with reservists and those who are in the permanent ADF.

         The Australian government has contributed almost $17 million to these activities since the deployment on 9 November. Shortly we expect the task before them to have been completed. On behalf of the Australian people and the Australian government, I express my admiration to those who have been deployed. I know the families in Townsville, Randwick and also in Richmond will look forward to their loved ones—Defence personnel—returning to Australia.
