       <p>
        I have received several complaints about long queues and customer wait times at Wallsend post office. Residents say they're waiting over half an hour to be served. Some have even been turned away because
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        staff do not have the time or capacity to respond to increased customer needs. One resident told me that she often leaves work early if she wants to be served at the Wallsend post office before 5 pm. Another noted that it's very common for there to be only three employees working during peak times, and they seem to be overwhelmed by the amount of foot traffic coming into the store.

        Wallsend post office serves a large region, including the rapidly growing suburbs of Maryland, Fletcher and Minmi. Postal services are essential, providing access to vital services connecting people and communities right across the country and the globe. This lack of resourcing is causing considerable stress to people of all ages in my community. I really appreciate the time and effort taken by those who have contacted my office to share their concerns and personal experiences with me. I stand with the people of Wallsend and support their calls for a properly resourced post office that meets customer and community needs not just now but into the future, and I call on Australia Post to invest in their workforce and postal services in Wallsend. They deserve nothing less.
