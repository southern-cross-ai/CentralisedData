        and the Liberals have shamefully teamed up to block 30,000 desperately needed homes. The Housing Australia Future Fund is a $10 billion investment in 30,000 new social and affordable homes and homes for veterans. It has the backing of housing experts, community housing providers, housing ministers from across the country and numerous crossbenchers in the parliament. The government wants to allocate this funding so it can start building, but we're being blocked by the Greens and the Liberals for political aims.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this won't deter the government from pushing forward on our efforts to ensure more Australians have a safe and affordable place to call home. Over the weekend, we've introduced a new $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, set to provide thousands of new social homes across the country and upgrade existing ones. We're also increasing rent assistance for the most vulnerable renters across Australia. This investment will enable the construction of more housing for more Australians in more parts of our nation. We've got an ambitious reform agenda to which we've been adding at every opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the Greens and the Liberals blocking this bill, our commitment remains unshaken. It now is their responsibility to explain why they don't support more homes that are desperately needed. They should stop blocking the Housing Australia Future Fund.

        On Sunday I was delighted to join our local Bangladeshi community for the Good Morning Bangladesh event at Mascot Public School. The event is part of the Cancer Council's Biggest Morning Tea, an initiative dedicated to raising funds for cancer research and treatment. It's now in its 10th year at Mascot Public School, and the Good Morning Bangladesh event is a fundraiser that's raised more than $60,000 for the Cancer Council over the decade. It's not merely about raising funds; it's also a celebration of multiculturalism and Bangladeshi culture. Some traditional dishes such parata, beef curry, piazu and haleem were served, and our community savoured these delicacies as we sipped warming masala tea.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank all those who've devoted their time and skills to preparing the meals and the treats. I commend all of the young volunteers under Azad Alam's leadership. The passion with which the next generation contributes to the community is really inspiring. I'm very proud to represent a thriving Bangladeshi community in

        . I want to thank them for their philanthropy and their contribution to our wonderful community. The Good Morning Bangladesh event makes a real difference to Australians that are impacted by cancer. It's an event that I'm very proud to support.
