       <p>
        Earlier this week, a spokesman from the Chinese foreign ministry tweeted a graphic, doctored and deeply disturbing image showing an Australian soldier holding a knife to an Afghan child. The Prime Minister rightly called it repugnant. I believe it is deeply offensive, a slap in the face to all Australians and an insult to the men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Those on the other side of the House have, rightly, joined with the government in condemning this tweet. When asked to apologise, the Chinese government doubled down. These actions are disgusting. This childish and petty act from an official Twitter account makes me sick.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
         The Chinese
        </a>
        government should be totally ashamed of itself. This image is state sanctioned abuse. It is toxic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Monday, my office has received hundreds of letters, telephone calls and other pieces of correspondence condemning the position of the Chinese government and demanding that I speak on their behalf. We should not allow ourselves to be silent and let the Chinese government lecture us on issues of morality or justice. They have no right to comment on such issuesâ€”no right at all. This is not a reflection on the Chinese people or the 1.2 million Australians with Chinese heritage who have chosen to make Australia their home. Actions such as this tweet and the fake, falsified image undermine the Chinese government's credibility, their legitimacy and their integrity in the eyes of the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        In August this year, China's Deputy Ambassador to Australia announced at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        that Beijing wanted a relationship marked by respect, goodwill, fairness and vision. This post represents none of those things. China says it wants to be considered a responsible and credible actor, but this tweet undermines China's credibility far more than it does Australia's. China says it wants to be Australia's mate. This isn't what mates do. The Chinese government is attempting to undermine and discredit the 26,000 Australians who served in Afghanistan with decency and honour. I myself served our nation in Afghanistan with pride. I met some of the civilian men and women and their children that this tweet is alleging we don't care about. I can tell you that, when these people saw Australian soldiers coming their way, they were relieved. They were glad to see us. They wanted to keep parts of our uniforms because they knew we were on their side. We, as Australians, won't be influenced by foreign propaganda or misinformation. We, as Australians, won't be intimidated by other nations. We are, and always will be, free from influence of foreign states.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recent IGADF inquiry demonstrates our nation's transparency and willingness to hold itself to account. The findings contain some very serious allegations. When we hear allegations of wrongdoing, we investigate them, so these allegations must be properly investigated and dealt with according to Australian law. But let's not forget: not one Australian soldier has been found guilty by an Australian court. They are all innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The very fact that our ADF has held itself accountable and conducted an internal inquiry is commendable. I can't imagine seeing an inquiry like this being done out of a country like China. If the situation were reversed, could you imagine the

         Chinese People's Liberation Army
        </a>
        holding a self-critical inquiry and holding themselves to account, let alone an Australian government department responding via a fabricated and disgusting tweet? I think Twitter has a case to answer for. The Chinese government does not allow its people to use Twitter, yet its government officials can to post falsified images. Why is this platform ignoring the calls for the images to be removed?
       </p>
       <p>
        My community is the largest garrison city in the country, and I support our men and women who put on the uniform every day. I stand with the Prime Minister in calling for the Chinese government to immediately apologise to our ADF men and women.
