       <p>
        Tonight I rise to pay recognition to the fine, outstanding volunteers in my electorate of Paterson. Last Saturday we celebrated the fourth year of the Paterson Citizen of the Year awards. There are four categories: Paterson Citizen of the Year, Corporate Citizen of the Year, Sports Achiever of the Year and Young Citizen of the Year.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were 19 nominees for Citizen of the Year: June Toms for her work on the Ladies Auxiliary of the

       </p>
       <p>
        But there can only be one winner and that winner was Ted Bickford. For more than a decade, Ted Bickford has been known as the graffiti buster in Forster-Tuncurry. Starting with a bicycle and a backpack filled with his wife’s kitchen cleaning aids, Ted took to removing graffiti from public and private property in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Great Lakes Shire
        </a>
        . Since those humble beginnings, Ted has been provided with a vehicle by the Great Lakes Shire Council. But Ted’s efforts have been expended on more than just removing graffiti; he has also forged strong friendships and links with and has been a mentor to many young people in the area who have witnessed Ted cleaning up the facilities that they use, such as the skate park. He has given many former graffiti offenders support and encouragement to become young adults who now take pride in their community rather than destroy it.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were five nominees for Corporate Citizen of the Year: Rodney Starr of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens" rel="nofollow">
         Port Stephens
        </a>
        Veterinary Hospital; Matt and Catherine Bliss from Coastline Plumbing; Allen and Sue Ray from Smarty Plants; and Brian and Marie Melick from McDonalds Forster; and the winner, Shane Bailey. Shane Bailey works for Hunter Workways and is a team leader in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Corps" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        program. Shane has been awarded the Corporate Citizen of the Year because of his efforts in mentoring young people. He works daily with Green Corps participants who undertake environmental projects in Port Stephens over a six-month period. But, instead of a leading a nine-to-five life and clocking off when the participants go home, Shane goes the extra distance by encouraging participants into the workforce, providing career advice and being a referee to employers. His strong connection with Green Corps members and his passion for providing training in the environmental sector mean that he earns their trust and encourages them to be the best they can be, whatever career path they might decide to take. Shane is a young ambassador for our region and is a future leader in our community.

       <p>
        There were four nominees for Sports Achiever of the Year: Carl Leonard, from Wirreanda Public School, who has done some outstanding work in the

        . Heath Francis is no stranger to accepting awards. He has been competing at a world level in running since 1998 and represented Australia at the Sydney Paralympics in 2000, at Athens in 2004 and at several world championships. This year he won gold at the Commonwealth Games in the 200 metres and he won three gold medals at the
