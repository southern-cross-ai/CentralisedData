        Congratulations to some extraordinary residents in the electorate of Bean who last week received national recognition for their service to our local community and Australia: Berwyn Clayton, for her significant service to the vocational education and training sector, particularly in research; Mrs Caroline Hughes, for decades of service to our local

         First Nations
        </a>
        people and community, including through

        </a>
        ; Mrs Elizabeth Harding, for her service to youth; Mr Barrington Jarman, for his service to Australia-Japan relations; Mr David Kerr, for his service to conservation and the environment; Mrs Nishi Puri, for her service to the Indian community of Canberra and to multiculturalism; and Mr Arun Venkatesha, for his service to the Indian community of Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        These humble Canberrans were largely caught off guard by this recognition. They have made, and continue to make, substantial contributions to our community. Some are volunteers; others have had a remarkable impact in professional roles; many have done both. All of them have something in commonâ€”people recognise the difference they have made to their community and country. I urge those in the community to take the time and nominate someone whom they believe has made a significant contribution. These extraordinary recipients would not have been recognised last week, and today, if it were not for the gesture of a friend, colleague or collaborator in submitting a nomination.
