        ROLLOUT: Resumption of debate (from 12 October 2015) on the motion of Mrs Wicks—That this House:

       <p class="italic">
        (1) places on the record that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) under the previous Government, at the time of the last election just 2 per cent of premises across Australia could access the

         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        (NBN); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) since the election the NBN rollout has ramped up significantly and today around one in ten premises can access the NBN and under the NBN's new Corporate Plan, by June 2018, three in four premises will have access to the NBN;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the NBN's 2016-2018 Corporate Plan reveals that a full fibre to the premises (

         FTTP
        </a>
        ) NBN could not be completed until 2026 at the earliest and could be as late as 2028—six to eight years later than the current Government's plan; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the NBN 2016-2018 Corporate Plan reveals that a full FTTP NBN would cost between $20 and $30 billion dollars more than the current Government's plan; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that it is essential to deliver fast broadband to Australians sooner—not force Australians with no or poor broadband to wait more than a decade for the NBN.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) February is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, which aims to raise awareness about ovarian cancer and help women recognise the signs and symptoms of the disease;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Thursday 24 February is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Day and encourages everyone to wear a teal ribbon to show their support for women living with ovarian cancer; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) about 1,500 Australian women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year and only 43 per cent of these will survive;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes with concern that ovarian cancer is diagnosed late as the symptoms are often similar to other common health problems;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that there is no early reliable detection test for ovarian cancer and that the Pap smear does not detect the disease;

        (b) the good work being done by Ovarian Cancer Australia to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of the disease;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) recognises that the four most common symptoms of ovarian cancer are:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) abdominal or pelvic pain;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) needing to urinate often or urgently; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) difficulty eating or feeling full quickly;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) understands that every Australian woman needs to know the symptoms of ovarian cancer; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) notes the need for more research funding to help Australian scientists find early detection markers and more effective treatments for this disease.
