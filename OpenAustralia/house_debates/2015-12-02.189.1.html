        Last Wednesday I had the opportunity of hosting student leaders from the Miller

        . Barbara Schefer, Edwin Lim, Mehdi Heidari and Chutikarn Chatree visited Parliament House from Sydney, together with their principal, Dr Ken Edge, and teachers Sally Atkins and Roger Thompson. These students visited Parliament House as part of a program that I have sponsored over the last 10 years. It provides student leaders with the opportunity to visit Canberra and to gain an insight into the roles and operations of our parliament.

        Miller Technology High School is located in my electorate in the south-west of Sydney in a very diverse and culturally rich community. The school's population has 50 per cent of its students coming from non-English-speaking backgrounds and seven per cent of the students are of Aboriginal descent. Many of these students come from families who have low socioeconomic backgrounds and the school facilitates a number of curriculum choices, including intensive English programs and cultural orientation to enhance the learning, understanding and knowledge of all students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the leadership of Dr Ken Edge, Miller Technology High School proudly celebrates its diversity through a range of cultural and artistic events each year. This year students were involved in the Fowler Anzac Centenary Competition designing artworks that depict their understanding of this important time in Australian history and to honour the commitment and service of those Australians during the

        . Miller Technology High School won a number of awards in the categories of visual arts and print. However, among the awards was a short film that was written, directed and performed by students, entitled

        . It took out first place in the performing arts category. It was certainly a most commendable achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June this year, 19 students from Miller Technology High School were also involved in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_Life" rel="nofollow">

        performance at the

        </a>
        . This was designed to commemorate Refugee Week. Their performances portrayed the personal experiences and stories of students that came from war-torn backgrounds in the hope of educating others and sharing their experiences in coming to this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year also represents a very significant time for Miller Technology High School as it marks the 50th anniversary since the school opened in 1965. I congratulate Miller Technology High School on reaching this tremendous milestone and wish them well for the future. I hope they continue their commitment to culture and diversity. It is an area we should be very proud of, particularly as it gives students the opportunity to extend themselves and be ready for employment in the bigger wider world.
