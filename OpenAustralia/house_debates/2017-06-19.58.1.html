        As Australians, it is our duty to care for the elderly, the infirm and those who cannot look after themselves later in life. I am pleased to advise that Bedingfeld Park, an assisted living centre in Pinjarra, received funding for an additional 25 beds under the 2016-17 Aged Care Approvals Round.

They often have to move out of town to find adequate services, meaning that they leave behind their community, their networks and their families. This funding represents an increase in Bedingfeld's capacity of more than 50 per cent, allowing more families to access the care they need without having to move to the city.
