        The people of Mackay, Proserpine, the Whitsundays, Bowen, the Burdekin and Townsville have been through a torrid few months, but now we're totally focused on the road to recovery. One of the keys is to support local jobs and local businesses. It's never been more important to do so than now. While there is plenty of work still to be done, particularly for those in the tourism sector, I stand by my record of delivery for the Dawson electorate and the huge volume of funding from the Morrison-McCormack Liberal-National government pouring into the roads, community facilities, schools and other not-for-profit groups across the region. There is $1.5 billion in major road upgrades between Mackay and Townsville right now supporting over 1,300 local jobs, with more jobs to come as other projects kick off next year. Our local councils have also had another $17 million to pour into their roads and community projects of their choice through this government's Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, together with the improved financial assistance grants. There is also $33.7 million in funding for community facilities in every corner of that electorate, including the Mackay northern beaches community hub, the Proserpine showgrounds, the Proserpine Entertainment Centre, on the Burdekin with boating facilities, and a veterans wellbeing centre in Townsville. All of these projects are supporting local jobs and local business.
