          My two questions to the minister are: what is the process by which the performance bonus for senior staff, including the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
           CEO
          </a>
          , are typically negotiated? What role does the minister play, if any, in approving those arrangements? The minister may know that the most recent annual report for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
           CSIRO
          </a>
          shows that the chief executive,

           Megan Clark

           and performance bonuses. To the extent that I cannot obtain that information in a timely fashion, I will get back to the shadow minister. I would like to take this opportunity to express the government's gratitude to Professor Megan Clark, because she has been exemplary in the work that she has done for

           â€”a great organisation in our country, which continues to work in the national interest for the people of Australia in leading-edge technology. We want that to continue, and I hope that we enjoy the support of the shadow minister in supporting the work of the CSIRO, including that of Professor Megan Clark.

            I have some further questions. Has the government sought to assure itself that there have been no instances where
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
             CSIRO
            </a>
            has not acted as a model litigant and how has this been done? Is the government aware that there have been cases in which CSIRO has not acted as a model litigant? Is it correct that CSIRO employees are encouraged and even obliged under their terms of employment to report instances of suspected bullying and other forms of unsafe workplace conduct?

                                , I am advised that the CSIRO has in place a range of measures to address situations where concerns are expressed about the behaviour of staff. CSIRO has engaged Emeritus Professor Dennis Pearce, former Commonwealth Ombudsman, as an independent investigator, assisted by law firm
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HWL" rel="nofollow">

                                Ebsworth, to review individual allegations and to identify opportunities for improvement in the organisation's processes for dealing with staff and welfare issues. Professor Pearce will provide his phase 1 reports to the CSIRO by 31 July.

                                It is, at least, ironic that the coalition are asking questions about harassment because we are implementing key recommendations from a report, through amendments to the Fair Work Act, to provide an individual right of recourse for victims of workplace bullying. The coalition said they would support the government's provisions. That has not happened. They have once again backflipped on a commitment that they gave, choosing to play politics rather than to protect vulnerable workers from bullying.

                                So, the coalition have demonstrated they cannot be trusted on workplace relations, They come here crying crocodile tears about workplace bullying or allegations thereof in the CSIRO, then actively vote down workplace bullying provisions. It just shows that the whole point of this exercise is trying to gain political points. I do not mind if they seek to do that against the governmentâ€”that is fineâ€”but to do it against the CSIRO and to attack the CSIRO

Given that the carriage, as the shadow minister knows very well, of the industry statement is actually by Minister Combet, perhaps it might have been sensible for the member for Indi to provide that question to Minister Combet. Maybe a question on notice would have been a more satisfactory approach to this issue.

                                       What you can take from me is that the ministerâ€”who has just arrivedâ€”oversaw the preparation of, I think, a landmark innovation-in-industry statement. It is a statement that has very widespread support. It also has support from the automotive industry, in which we have invested heavily and which the coalition would rip out half of its funding in 2015 aloneâ€”a fact that the shadow minister has acknowledged. Why? Because her shadow expenditure review committee rolled her. She has to go around the nation saying, 'We support auto workers' but in truth what they are doing is saying to the auto workers of Victorian and, more broadly, all the component manufacturers, 'Vote for us and we will cut your jobs; we will cut half your assistance by 2015 and that is coalition policy.'.

                                          On the point of order, the question was about the industry statement. The industry statement establishes innovation precincts. It supports a range of industries including the automotive industry. That is why I was answering the question. It was entirely relevant and, given that the shadow minister has no sensible questions to ask and that she has come here simply to try to score some points at the expense of the government, that is fine. But at the expense of Dr

                                            Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The government, of course, as has been well articulated, is committed to developing a clean energy future and at the same time ensuring a strong and prosperous economy with very strong policies and the support of industry and innovation.

                                            When proceedings were suspended, I was just about to remark that, since the last appropriations in the portfolio areas, the government have brought together the functions of climate change and industry and innovation into the overall department. Climate change, of course, is an important part of the government's policy agenda. It is an environmental problem which requires an economic solution, and that is why we have merged the responsibility for climate change policy into the department responsible for driving innovation and industry policy in the economy. The need to reduce carbon pollution and to transform the economy to compete in a low carbon global economy will be the key drivers of Australia's industrial structure.

                                            The evidence is clear that the carbon price is working: emissions are down and renewable energy is up, and the economy is remaining strong. It is worth putting on the record, I think, that, since the carbon price started on 1 July last year, emissions in the

                                            has grown at an annualised rate of 2.5 per cent since the carbon price started. That means that our economy has expanded by 14 per cent since Labor was elected in 2007. More than 150,000 new jobs have been created since carbon pricing commenced. Inflation remains contained at 2.5 per cent, the midpoint of the

Millions of households have been assisted with tax cuts, increases in family tax benefits and higher pensions and allowances, and the impact on the cost of living has been lower than expected. That means that the assistance has gone further in helping low- and middle-income earners to make ends meet.

                                            The fact is that the clean energy policies we have implemented are environmentally effective; they are economically responsible; and they are socially fair. Reducing the emissions intensity of the economy, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output, is in fact critical to Australia's future competitiveness and to the integrity of our trading relationships. Our trading partners want to see what Australia is doing while they are also taking action on climate change. We are the 12th largest economy in the world. We are the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and we are the largest emitter of greenhouse gases per person amongst all of the advanced economies. It is fantasy to believe that our trading partners, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, have no interest in Australia tackling the issue of climate change in partnership with them. The policy of the alternative government, of course, is to do nothing, in essenceâ€”nothing.
                                           </p>

                                            The government also supports jobs and growth in the economy. We support manufacturing with a strong set of policies. We understand that you cannot have a strong economy without a strong and sustainable manufacturing sector that employs nearly one million Australians across the country in well-paid, high-skilled jobs. We are acutely aware that the sector is facing challenges from the high value of the Australian dollar and intense import competition. To deal with those pressures, the government is investing a billion dollars to support and grow jobs.

                                            Our plan released in February, A Plan for Australian Jobs, has three core strategies: backing Australian firms to win more work at home; supporting Australian industry to innovate, increase exports and win business abroad; and helping Australian

                                            s to grow and create new jobs. The whole package builds on the support we have delivered in many sectors already, including measures like the Steel Transformation Plan, with $300 million to support steelworkers' jobs; the $5.4 billion New Car Plan, supporting the auto-manufacturing sector; and $1.2 billion in clean technology investment programs helping to transform the energy efficiency and emissions intensity of the manufacturing sector. All of these policies are funded in the budget announced in May. All of them are very important for tackling both climate change and the economic challenges the country has.

That would make six ministers in 16 months handling small business. It is good; you are probably at no more disadvantage than the incumbentâ€”but thank you. Minister, I will just draw your attention to some of the commentary on budget night.

                                             My first question is to invite you to see if you can identify any single specific positive measure directly intended to support the small business community. We could find no such measure in any of the budget documentation that has been available. Some commentary since has sought to cobble together bits and pieces going on elsewhere that may happen to go past a window of a small business in terms of their support.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             My second question relates to some of the measures that are included. I refer to the bringing forward of tax liabilities to a monthly payment arrangement for many Australian businesses, and an observation by some that that risks transferring the cash-flow burden to small business, where those caught up in that measure will need to rejig their own cash flow to respond to the tax office requirementsâ€”and that may be to the detriment of small business. I also invite you to advise whether any analysis has been done on the impact of that measure now, given that it was originally inspired by the prospect of a budget surplus that now is not on the horizon. The small businesses of Australia would have to see Labor elected four times before there is any prospect of a surplus.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             In relation to business confidence, there is the really worrying sign that, since Labor was elected, nearly 243,000 jobs have been lost from small business. Yet the government and the budget seem completely unresponsive to those job losses from what should be the engine room of the economy but actually feels like one that has had some cylinders taken out. Minister, it is a fact that there are 3,000 fewer small businesses employing people in the latest figures, compared to when your government was elected. Again, if you could point me to any measure in the document that seeks to turn that around and look beyond the economy as it is now to one where small business and enterprise are valued and supported, that would be helpful.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             There is also further money in the budget, on top of the $125 million, to fix the business names registerâ€”$7.8 million. I am looking for your assurance that that will fix the problems with the register, including the broken promise of this government not to breach the privacy of home based businessesâ€”a promise that has not been kept that we sought to pursue with the government late last year, to no avail.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Finally, one of the things the government likes to point to in the budget is its establishment of a small business commissioner, an able person that does not actually have a commission. There is no clear purpose or legislative basis for that role. We learnt through the budget and in Senate estimates last night that it is not actually an ongoing program, so that token interest is actually disappearing, even though the government announced this positionâ€”a commissioner with no commissionâ€”as being really significant to ensuring small business remains at the forefront of government policy-making.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Minister, essentially the thesis that the public is providing on the budget as it relates to small business is that it is not the kick-start they were looking for but just another kick; and it is making an already difficult situation worse, one compounded by the world's largest carbon tax, which you have spoken aboutâ€”that small business is supposed to simply suck it up or pass on the costs of that tax, when anyone with any appreciation of the real economy would know that, in many cases, neither is possible.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Are we to expect some new declaration of interest in small business in the 101 days before the next election? There is no provision for that in the budget, and I am wondering whether we can expect some sort of

                                              That is a pretty long list of questions that the member for Dunkley has advanced there, but I will do my best to work my way through them.

                                              The starting point is that the most important thing for small businesses, medium-sized businesses and large businesses, and the workforce generally, is that the economic settings are right. As the national accounts evidenced today, our economy is growing; real
                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

                                              is growing at an annualised rate of 2Â½ per cent. Very, very few economies internationally, particularly advanced economies, can claim such a growth rate. We have had, I think, two decades of continuous growth. We avoided the global financial crisis, we made investments in jobs and growth, and that same approach is, of course, reflected in this budget. I do not know that the coalition's strategy on fiscal policy would be of assistance to small business if the strategy involves cutting deeply and imposing austerity measures in the circumstances we are in. That would have a contractionary effect and it would be felt very sharply by the small-business community in particular. So the government has taken the view in fiscal strategy as a general approach in the budget, as we have in recent years, of making the investments that are necessary to continue economic growth and continue a positive environment for investment.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              What else is relevant to small business? Small businesses are benefitting not only from the annual economic growth we are experience but also from the significant fall in interest rates that we have seen in recent years. The official cash rate now stands at 2.75 per cent. We have got a stable inflationary environment, as I indicated earlier, with inflation at around 2.5 per centâ€”the mid-point of the
                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">

Again, the important thing at a macroeconomic level is that, since 2007, almost one million jobs have been created in our economyâ€”and at a time during which the international circumstances have been extremely adverseâ€”and growth has been experienced across the economy, not just in resources and resource related sectors.

                                             <p>
                                              On issues specifically to assist business, there are a range of measures in the budget that have been supported that I would draw the member's attention to. I referred earlier to the $1 billion investment plan, A Plan for Australian Jobs, which will assist small businesses grow and compete in global markets and create jobs. One of the features of that plan is to oblige the proponents of major projects worth more than $500 million, for example, to prepare Australian industry participation plans. These are plans that can and will benefit small and medium size enterprises gain access to the work that is going to be contracted in goods and services not only through the construction phase of major projects but also in their operational phase subsequently.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              As part of the plan, also relevant to small and medium size enterprises, the government is investing about $350 million in Venture Australia, a venture capital fund. It will be matched dollar for dollar in the private sector to stimulate Australia's venture capital market. The experience with
                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">

                                              s, in particular those that are innovative and have ideas and technologies they want to commercialise, is that they often have trouble getting access to the venture capital that is necessary to help them commercialise their circumstances. That is a significant initiative that has had bipartisan support over the years, but the government has invested another $350 million in it, with a track record of success.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              There is also in the budget a new $27.7 million Enterprise Solutions Program to assist small and medium size businesses gain access to public sector markets; the idea being that, when a governmentâ€”and in this case, obviously the Commonwealthâ€”intends tendering or contracting for a particular good or service, there will be a fund that will be accessible to SMEs to help them successfully develop the materials and do the work to be able to tender in a public sector procurement process. That is important. I can return to the issue again, but there is also very important funding of $500 million for up to 10 industry innovation precincts that, in particular, will be important for SMEs. I can return to that issue shortly, and there are other measures that I can also turn to in relation to small business.

                                               Minister, in your opening statement you talked about the challenging environment that manufacturing, in particular, is facing, with competition from emerging economies, the high Australian dollar, higher input costsâ€”particularly in the steel sector with coal and iron ore over the past three years at times hitting record prices. I am interested in some of the measuresâ€”some of which you have identifiedâ€”that are supporting manufacturing. It matters a lot in my electorate, the electorate of Throsby in
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                                               , which has traditionally had a big reliance on manufacturing and related industries for regional wealth creation and of course jobs.

                                              <p>
                                               I know it is outside of your portfolio specifically, but some of it falls within your portfolio. I count eight specific measures, one of them being the antidumping measures that have gone through a number of amendments over the last 12 months to bring them into line with international practice and the current circumstances. I would like to hear from you, Minister, why that and how that is important to Australian manufacturing businesses.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Minister, you also mentioned the innovation precincts in response to a question from the member for Dunkley. I am interested in how the innovation precincts would assist local manufacturers, not only now but into the future. The steel industry innovation plan is an important program for the steel makers in my electorate, particularly BlueScope. Why was that plan important, and how is it making a difference? Minister, could you advise us on how that is making a difference in securing the future of the steel industry in this country? I think you have already gone to the clean energy investment programs, so I will not question you further on that. The automotive industry innovation program is an important program. We know the industry is going through a lot of stress at the moment. Are there any threats to the ongoing future of that program?
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Finally, there is the Australian jobs legislation, the Australian Jobs Bill, which passed through the House of Representatives last week. A crucial part of that program looks at Australian industry participation plans. Of course, these are not new. We have had Australian industry participation plans in place for quite some time. What is new about the arrangements in the Australian Jobs Bill? What other provisions included in the bill will make a difference?
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               When I talk to manufacturers in my electorate, one of their common retorts is: 'We can't win work in a lot of these large resources, government and other related projects. We get mickey mouse invitations to tender. Sometimes they come in on the Friday and close on the Monday. We want to know what the government is going to do. How is this bill going to make a difference for businesses such as this to win work in these large projects and how is it going to support local manufacturing?'

                                                I thank the member for Throsby for those important questions. As I indicated earlier, the government announced in February a $1 billion plan for Australian jobs, and included within that are many of the measures which the member for Throsby is inquiring about. The first important part of the plan involves the establishment of Australian industry participation obligations on major project proponentsâ€”major projects being those worth more than $500 millionâ€”regardless of what part of the economy they may be in. Many people immediately think of the resources sector, which of course is a case, but it may in fact be a wind farm or a new power station. What is new in particular is that we formulated to implement that policy, the Australian Jobs Bill, and it is currently before the Senate, having passed the House. That will place for the first time a legal obligation on the proponents of these major projects to prepare Australian industry participation plans in consultation with a new statutory agency, the Australian Industry Participation Authority.

                                                The project proponents must, under the legislation and under the eye of the authority, provide fair and reasonable opportunity to Australian businesses to successfully tender in for the goods and services during the construction phase and the early operational phases of these projects. That is new. An

This will now apply to all projects worth more than $500 million.

                                                In consultation with manufacturers, whom we expect to benefit significantly from this legislation and this policy approach, they have raised many issues concerning the specifications, the timing, the lack of information, the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability that many project proponents have taken in their approach to date. For example, it is argued by the manufacturing sector that, with some of the major projects in Australia, the large international corporations come along and bring their global supply chain with them, because they know that supply chain works to particular quality standards, they are familiar with their supply chain and they simply engage in the contract to do the work through their contractors. We have to create the transparency and the accountability to ensure that manufacturers and

The detail in the Australian Jobs Bill will ensure that that is the case, and I have indicated to industry that if they see any concern for the way in which it is working they must raise it with the government and we will act upon it. Any fair and reasonable concern will be dealt with.

                                                In relation to other measures that the government has put in place that the member inquired about, antidumping is also extremely important. Measures are before the House at the moment, a further tranche of reforms to the antidumping arrangements and the resourcing for Customs to properly pursue antidumping applications. These are important reforms which are critical to the viability of many areas of manufacturing in our country. We put those proposals togetherâ€”myself and the Minister for

They will provide fast access and much more transparency and ability on the part of Customs to be able to deal with antidumping arrangements. Without any doubt, there has been in a number of markets a development of a glut of products on global markets, and many businesses have raised these issues with the government in the context of dumping. We want to deal with that issue and we want to get the legislation through as expeditiously as possible.

                                                 I have three brief questions for the minister. The first is that on the department's industry website key automotive statistics are fairly old and out of date; they date back to 2011 or earlier in some cases. What are the most up-to-date figures for the following categories: vehicle production, exports, turnover, labour productivity and R&amp;D? If the minister does not know, when will the opposition be able to have this information?

                                                 My second question is: who is attending the so-called crisis talks meetings on the car industry with the government on Friday, and is it true that at least one of the local car manufacturing companies is not even coming to the talks? If so, which one?

                                                 My third question is one that Senator Lundy could not answer in Senate estimates yesterday, so I will ask the minister. Will Ford's decision last month to shut down all of its car manufacturing in Australia change the total amount of money the government will make available through the

                                                    I will do it as expeditiously as I canâ€”there is no need to have any concern about that. In terms of the talks this coming Friday, I think the member asked me who is not coming. I am expecting all the principal representatives of the industry to be there. I have not been appraised of any apologies. However, what I can say is that it is an important discussion for representatives of the industry, including the unions and with the government, to consider all of the challenges that the industry is facing. Principal among those challenges is the issue of the high value of the Australian dollar. It is important to contemplate for a moment that for each one-cent appreciation in the value of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the

We have seen significant appreciation in the exchange rate in recent years, and in the last two years in particular, that has impacted significantly on the competitiveness of the automanufacturing industry in Australia. On top of that, the industry is going through massive structural change, at a global level. All of the major motor-vehicle manufacturers are restructuring their operations internationally. As is well known, there were various bailout arrangements put in place in the United States for Ford and

                                                      It is important to ensure that there is proper understanding of the issues confronting the industry, and the restructuring of the industry globally is very important. A lot of investment is going into expanded production in China. Expected production runs in a motor-vehicle manufacturing facility in China might be 250,000 units per year or 300 units per year or more. The major motor-vehicle manufacturers are looking at their operations internationally, comparing them to that sort of benchmark and the economies of scale that can be achieved and also contemplating the development of vehicles that are essentially globally designed and that are uniformly marketed across a range of markets.

                                                         These are important matters for consideration, the way in which the relevant vehicle-manufacturing industry is working. Within the context of the Australian operations, Ford is looking at its Chinese operations, looking at the capital upgrade that might have been necessary for production of new models post 2016, looking at the production capacity of its plant at Broadmeadows and the engine facility at Geelong and it came to a view, communicated to the government a couple of weeks ago, that it would no longer continue production past 2016. That international context is extremely important.

Can the minister confirm that it is the government's intention to proceed with a second phase of the carbon tax and that it is budgeted within the forward estimates to include a tax of approximately $510 million in 2014-15 alone, and does the minister dispute the evidence given to the Senate inquiry on the scrutiny of new taxesâ€”in particular, the carbon tax pricing mechanism of Friday, 22 July 2011â€”by Mr Tony Sheldon the National Secretary of the

He was referring specifically in that context to the impact of the heavy vehicle carbon tax.

I will come to the specifics of the member for Flinder's question but it is important to emphasise that in the first 11 months of the operation of the carbon price mechanism emissions in the national electricity market are down by 7.4 per cent. It is an equivalent of a 12-million-tonne reduction of greenhouse gasses in the national electricity market. Renewable energy generation in the market is up almost 30 per cent, all at the same time as the economy is growing with the national accounts confirming today an annualised rate of growth in real

The impact on the cost of living having been lower than anticipated, of course that household assistance goes further. So, all the nonsense that the coalition have gone on about is to be regarded with the greatest scepticism. There is not one thing that has been said in the terror campaign that the coalition has run about carbon pricing that has had the slightest bit of validity, integrity or legitimacyâ€”all rubbish.
                                                                  </p>

That remains the case. The budget does reflect the policy provision that was announced in 2011, that the government is committed to and that is reflected in the budget papers, that there would be an equivalent carbon price on heavy on-road vehicles subject to the specific detail that would be brought forward from 1 July 2014.
                                                                  </p>

They said it would be the end of the worldâ€”it has not been the end of the worldâ€”and that the price was going to go up and up and up. Now they are running around because of low market prices in the European market, arguing it is terrible because it is going to go down and down and down.
                                                                  </p>

I am sure that the member is well familiar with them. That means from 1 July 2015, subject of course to the market conditions and there are two more budgets before that time when Treasury will of course be revising their projections and ultimately their estimates and forecasts as that time nears, the price may be lower than the coalition is endeavouring to try to terrify people, including those in the heavy on-road vehicle industry.

I know there are many members on this side of the House that are very interested in the carbon price mechanism. I go specifically to the area that I have responsibility in, the Carbon Farming Initiative. I know there are many members who are interested in what opportunities the government has provided to the land sector as part of the Clean Energy Future plan.
                                                                       </p>

One of those elements is the carbon price; secondly, the renewable energy; thirdly, the energy efficiency; and, importantly, action on the land. The Carbon Farming Initiative is a key element of that plan to take action for our agriculture, forestry and landfill sectors.
                                                                       </p>

It is there to encourage the agricultural, forestry and landfill sectors to take action to reduce their greenhouse emissions or to increase their carbon storage through changing their agricultural, forestry and landfill practices. This is referred to as abatement. Those activities in those sectors, if they are achieving additional abatement, are able to create additional Australian carbon credits. These credits then can be sold in the market. There is a lot of good work and opportunity there for the land sector.
                                                                       </p>

We are now approaching 12 months since the Clean Energy Future plan commenced. In that time we have bedded down the CFI and busied ourselves with refining its detailed rules and methodologies. We have established rigorous expert review and integrity provisions that are ensuring that every tonne of carbon pollution offset by the CFI is a real tonne of carbon pollution. We have worked with farmers, landholders, and agricultural and forestry industries to establish projects and to support them to engage with Australia's carbon market.
                                                                       </p>

Farmers, landholders and regional communities are benefiting from new income that has flowed from the scheme and from the new jobs that are flowing to the regions. I know Deputy Speaker, Livermore, you are from a regional electorate and would appreciate the importance of the Carbon Farming Initiative.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        As already stated, the CFI provides farmers with the ability to create carbon credits and sell those into the market. But those credits will only fetch a decent price in the market if it has confidence that they represent real abatement. The integrity of the CFI is critical to the success of the scheme. That is why this government has established the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, known as the DOIC, to oversee the consideration of activities and methodologies, and to make recommendations to the government.
                                                                       </p>

The DOIC consists of a panel of eminent scientists and land sector specialists whose role is to assess and stress test every methodology before it is allowed in. All activities that can generate credits under the CFI can only do so because the committee has assessed them as being robust.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        The importance of this committee cannot be overstated. I certainly wish to thank the committee for their efforts over the past year. The committee really is a gatekeeper for the CFI, and it bears the important responsibility for ensuring the scheme is credible. In undertaking that task, the committee is assisted through the establishment of many partnerships with Australia's leading universities and research institutions to unlock the next generation of abatement opportunities on the land.
                                                                       </p>

The DOIC has been working hard to assess proposals that have been put forward since its commencement. I am pleased to report the CFI has grown in scope and coverage in the past year. The CFI relies on the existence of methodologies for each covered activity, and we now have 15 methodologies in place covering a range of abatement opportunities across the forestry sector, dairies, piggeries, landfill and grassland. Farmers can now own carbon credits by revegetating marginal lands on their properties; foresters can earn credits by reforesting cleared land; dairies and piggeries are able to earn credits by capturing methane from their facilities and burning those emissions before they escape into the atmosphere; and landfill operators can earn carbon credits by diverting organic waste and treating it safely. The member will be pleased to know that there is more on the way; in coming months, further methodologies will be finalised and new projects established.

During the course of that answer the minister made reference to the fact that the price paid after 2015-16 may in fact be lower than the revenue projections in the budget. I would ask the minister whether he stands by the revenue projections in the budget, or whether he is indicating that the actual expectation of the government is for a lower priceâ€”consistent with the forward European market priceâ€”than has been projected in the budget. In short, is there a black hole in the budget, or was the statement about lower prices merely false? It is a binary question; only one answer can be true. I will just note this: the government's price projection for 2015-16 in the budget is down from $29 in last year's budget to $12.10 in this year's budget. That is approximately twice the current trading range for European permits in the three-year forward market. It is, a year later, three times the trading range for forward permits in the European market. So the question to the minister is, which is correctâ€”are the government's revenue projections correct, or is the European market correct? Are we going to be paying over what the rest of the world is paying, or is there a black hole in the government's budget?

They provide a vital service to the nation. As the regional development minister can I say that the role that the ABC play in regional Australia cannot be underestimated in terms of providing a service to the community, particularly at times when information on natural disasters is important to be transmitted in real time. In addition to the continuing base funding of $2.5 billion over three years, $182 million will be provided to the ABC for new measures, including a loan to assist in the construction of a purpose-built facility at Southbank in Melbourne; funding to enable the expansion of ABC news and current affairs; funds to enable it to meet growing audience demand for its digital media services; and funding to produce documentaries commemorating the Anzac Centenary.

I note that the SBS has recently expanded some of its language services to facilitate access to some of the newer communities that have arrived in Australia in recent times. I congratulate them and the leadership that they show in the community in promoting inclusiveness as an essential element of the success of multicultural Australia.

In the spirit of seeking some enlightenmentâ€”light as opposed to heatâ€”I invite the minister to respond substantively, if he can; if he cannot answer substantively, then he should say so, rather than giving a sort of ad hominem spray, which is what we had from his counterpart Mr Shorten. This is the issue I want to seek the minister's views on. We know that the received wisdom, official wisdom, on asbestos isâ€”and I am quoting now from the code of practice How to Manage and Control Asbestos in the Workplace, at page 17. It says here:

However, if the asbestos or ACM has deteriorated, has been disturbed, or if asbestos-contaminated dust is present, the likelihood that airborne asbestos will be released into the air is increased.

Telstra's approach has been not to seek to replace asbestos-containing material unless the pit is disturbed for whatever reason. Of course, what we have seen with the advent of the

The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made it clear now that, despite the interest he evinced in 2009, he did not raise his concerns about this with either the communications minister or NBN and Telstra in 2011 or 2012.
                                                                                </p>

Of course, as the minister knows, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the Telstra pits are being replaced because they are too small for the NBN's purposes.
                                                                                </p>

The question is: given the remarks that the workplace relations minister has made, is the government's view that there should be, as Mr Shorten recommended in 2009, proactive material of otherwise stable, undisturbed, intact asbestos-containing material?
                                                                                </p>

The government is proud of its track record in supporting the national broadcasters, and it is a track record built upon the recent budget and the triennial funding announcement.

The government is also providing the ABC with a loan of $90 million over three years so it can consolidate the majority of its Melbourne based operations at its Southbank site. This will allow the ABC to achieve operational savings while continuing to deliver high-quality broadcast content. In addition to new funding announced in the budget, the ABC will receive $2.5 billion over three years in ongoing base funding from 2013-14. That base funding is important.

I remember the ABC out lobbying too at that time and walking around the halls of parliament, and I also remember that I wrote a letter about that to the minister, lobbying on it. I was at that stage the only MP who had written a letter on it. Then I led the charge to make sure that all the other MPs did that as well, and that was across the parliament.

The honourable member for Wentworth is fond of asserting that the public broadcasters have no greater friend than him.

They certainly play a fine role there.

We are committed to the independence as well of the ABC and SBS, unlike the former government that stacked the boards with right-wing ideologues. We have ensured that there is a professionalism brought to the appointment of the boards and to those institutions.

It must be said that the dangers were apparent to executives in companies such as James Hardie a long time before they were prepared to fess up to the consequences of this deadly product for which they were prepared to put profit before the lives of those people who worked with the product and those people who just lived in communities. Indeed, it is the case that where building work for infrastructure takes place in cities such as Sydney there needs to be absolute care to ensure that the workers are protected and also that communities are unaffected where this work is taking place.

This is something that does need to be above politics. The member for Wentworth is clearly genuine in his concerns about these issues; these issues are serious but they are not new. We know that claims, for example, that legacy infrastructure with asbestos will not be disturbed under the coalition's plan is not true. That is why these claims are now being refuted by industry experts. We need to make sure that this work occurs in an appropriate way. There is no way to avoid interacting with asbestos when you are working on Australia's fixed telecommunications network. The member for Wentworth cannot avoid dealing with asbestos if he is ever in a position to build his fibre to the node system which would consist of some 70,000 nodes at least.

We know that in 2001 Telstra wanted to create an independent body to fast-track compensation payments to employees exposed to asbestos. They sought approval from the then Department of Workplace Relations, but they got knocked back. The then Minister for Workplace Relations was the current Leader of the Opposition. So, the opposition leader knew about those issues as far back as 2001, when Telstra made a clear approach to the department. In 2005 it was raised again.

The minister provided an answer in February 2006 that explained Telstra's use of asbestos in pits, ducts and exchanges and the possibility of exposure. This has been an issue that has been around for a long time. This is an issue that requires every care.

I have found some of the politicking in the last week or so a bit galling, frankly, given the history of these issues. Of these issues, I would say that Telstraâ€”just like any other company or organisation engaged in activity that is likely to disturb asbestosâ€”needs to take every care possible.

The question was this: is the government saying that undisturbed, intact, non-friable asbestos-containing material should not be left in situâ€”as is the practice at Telstra; as indeed is contemplated in the national codesâ€”but rather should be proactively removed, notwithstanding that this carries, as the national code I read from earlier, risks of contamination?

That is why I said at the outset that I do not want to have a slanging match with the minister opposite. I do not want to get into ancient history. I want to get some clarity on this very important point. I will leave that with the minister. I would just respond to the honourable member from the north coast.

I want to ask the minister whether he is concerned and what he is going to do about the failure of the NBN to meet its rollout targets. It was originally forecast, in late 2010, to pass 950,000 brownfield premises by 30 June this year. In August 2012 that was scaled back to 286,000 premisesâ€”a massive reduction. As of the end of March, that was scaled back again to somewhere between 155,000 and 175,000 premises to be passed. As of mid May, so we have been told, they have only passed just over 70,000 premises.
                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                        The big issue here is whether there is a flaw in the construction model and whether this project is genuinely scalable in the manner contemplated in the corporate plan. We are being told directlyâ€”through the media and elsewhereâ€”that contractors are not making a living out of this work. I was talking to a contractor today who said to me that his rate to excavate, remove and dispose of a Telstra pit made of asbestos-containing material was $78. He said he cannot make a living out of that. He said his rate for putting in a new, large, plastic pit and setting it all upâ€”buying the pit, labour, materials and everything elseâ€”was $295. This is a very relevant issue. Is the reason the project is running so slowly the fact that the contractors are not making a quid out of it?
                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                        The challenge is that at the moment the NBN Co. is passing 353 houses a working day, in this half year. That is the current rate. They should have been passing over a thousand. Their plan calls for them next year to be passing 10 times that number. Every time the NBN Co. has missed a targetâ€”and this is a fact, this is not conjectureâ€”it asserts that the ramp-up is going to be even steeper. I ask the minister whether the government is satisfied with the rollout so far and what measures he believes the government and the NBN Co. should take to enable it to get closer to meeting the targets in its corporate plan?

It will cost just about as much, but for a far inferior product in which they have acknowledged would need to be upgraded before they have even started.

It is logical that the initial stages of the rollout of the NBN would be slower than the middle stages and the middle stages would be slower than the final stages. That is the way that infrastructure happens. Whether it be the NBN or the building of a road or a new rail line. If you look at the regional rail network in Victoria, which is in my portfolio, you will see that we are now expending over $100 million every month on what is the largest infrastructure commitment to public transport that any Australian government has given to any project. It ramps-up with huge benefits for Melbourne but also, importantly, for Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. We on this side of the House understand infrastructure and the way that it develops. We understand that you need to get it right the first time. We understand that you need to be committed to put that investment in and that you get a return on that investment. Indeed, the NBN will deliver a return, not just an economic return but a social return as well because of the benefits it will bring to the provision of education and health services, because of the opportunity that will be created, particularly in regional Australia, at overcoming the tyranny of distance that has been a disadvantage for people in regional Australia, compared with their counterparts in CBD electorates, or the distance of Australia from the rest of the world. This is a very important project. The rollout is proceeding. The only threat to the rollout is the failure to re-elect the Labor government in September.

Indeed, one of the universities that is in my electorate has already talked to me about ways in which they might be able to take the opportunity advanced by the NBN to develop some telehealth, some medical applications, for the NBN and to pursue opportunities there in conjunction with other organisations. It is very welcome in educational institutions. I know that it is certainly welcome by small businesses and large businesses alike and, indeed, by residents in my part of the world.

It is being very well received and there is much anticipation of the rollout in those areas, as there is across the

So I am sure he is familiar with the interest in the NBN's roll out to homes and businessesâ€”not to somewhere down the street but right to people's doors. This is so that they can use the NBN for the transformative purpose that it was intended to have, such as for social use by people who might be isolated in the more remote parts of my electorate. It will be very beneficial for not only a lot of elderly residents who have taken an interest in our Broadband for Seniors program but, needless to say, also business applications.

I can certainly say that there was much interest in the NBN's application for business, particularly in that part of my electorate which is effectively on the urban rural fringe of Melbourne. I guess you might call it a peri-urban area. For people who may have to travel quite long distances to transact business, when the NBN is rolled out to that area it will be extremely beneficial, and there was much interest in it. Likewise, I have mentioned medical use and, of course, educational use for the NBN. Clearly, a great deal of work has been done right across government, not simply in this portfolio but in the health portfolio and the education portfolio to establish the NBN and to contemplate its applications immediately as it rolls out and into the future.

Business operators are certainly acutely aware of the benefits that are presented to them by cloud computing, which enables them to have the potential to access quite powerful

Regrettably, those opposite routinely forget about the importance of upload speeds or upload capacity. Happily, we have not forgotten that. We are alive to it in the context of cloud computing. It is really unfortunate that those opposite have not seen the potential for cloud computing to advance business or the NBN as a means to advance businessâ€”those whom they purport so regularly to speak on behalf of.

I of course have had the pleasure of visiting the fine electorate of La Trobe, including to a community cabinet meeting where we had discussions with local business leaders about the capacity for the NBN to allow an area which is on the urban fringes of the great city of Melbourne to engage and compete in real time and not have to be located in the CBD. That has other advantages as well in terms of transport and transforming the lifestyles of people who live in such a magnificent electorate, which has lots of open space and a lot of attractiveness to it. The areas on the outskirts of our cities have had the disadvantage of distance, and one of the things that the NBN does is make it very possible for businesses to locate and compete in a real sense, because the physical location is not as important and, of course, there are all the applications that the member speaks about, particularly in terms of medical technology.
                                                                                          </p>

The sorts of comments that you see from time to time about the NBN just being about downloading movies faster than is possible in other areas is an example of that.

It is about embracing the opportunities that it will bring. It is a democratic mechanism, which is very important in terms of participation in that two-way interactive environment of the future. So I thank the member for La Trobe, and I certainly look forward to the opportunities of the future as facilitated by the rollout of the NBN.

He gives the impression that he is more familiar with roads than he is with telecom networks. But the point is not that the rollout is slower at the beginning than it is at the middle and the end; the point is that the rollout is so far behind the NBN Co.'s own corporate plan. It is the NBN not failing anybody else's standards but failing its own standards. In that context, I want to draw his attention to a report today in

The NBN Co.'s chief executive said to a Senate committee last week that the problem with the wireless rollout was due to large trees. I wonder if the minister could reflect on whether a cost-benefit analysis would have identified the fact that in regional Australia there are quite a lot of trees, large and small. It does seem curious that the presence of trees, large trees, would come as a shock to the NBN Co. and that it had not been anticipated. The other reason to which the chief executive of the NBN Co. attributed this huge failure to meet their target was inaccurate address information, which I gather means that they could not find their customers. This seems to be an extraordinary failure, and I wonder whether the minister's normal cheerful equanimity will be disturbed by the revelation that the NBN Co. failed to anticipate that there were large trees in Australia, some or all of them containing koalas, no doubt, and that the NBN Co., in addition to that, has failed to be able to find its customers.

I seek to get his views on this question of asbestos and fibre to the node by just drawing to his attention the fact that the whole point of a fibre-to-the-node rollout, the justification for it, is that it involves much less civil works. The minister would know that 80 per cent of the cost of a telecom rollout, if not more, is in the civil works. The electronics and the cables are actually a relatively small part of it, even though they are the most obviously ingenious and brilliant. So, by definition, a fibre-to-the-node rollout, while it does not exclude exposure to asbestos-containing materials entirelyâ€”and no-one has suggested that it does, least of all meâ€”does of necessity mean that the infrastructure between the street cabinet and the customer's premise is not being disturbed in the way it is with a fibre-to-the-premise rollout. That is why there is not the need to dig up and replace millions of Telstra pits and thousands of kilometres of Telstra ducts and pipes. I just want to draw that to the minister's attention and see if that would cause him to review his opinion.

I note that the Nationals' Senator Joyce said in 2009 that the National Broadband Network is 'truly the Nationals' broadband network' as it has been 'lifted', according to Senator Joyce, straight from the Page Research Centre's position paper in 2005 into telecommunications. The senator said, 'How could we disagree with something that is quite evidently our idea?'

And while on the subject of rural and regional Australia, as an aside, minister, you may also be aware of the principle in Labor's NBN of wholesale equivalent of pricing, whereas the alternative document proposes to get rid of this and exacerbate the digital divide not only on accessibility but also affordability as between regional and metropolitan areas.

That figure actually went up afterwards to be 78 per cent support from people compared to the alternative. So my question, minister, is: what are the benefits of rolling out fibre to 11.8 million homes and businesses in Australia?

Under pressure from the federal opposition, they have walked away from this. In Brisbane we know, as a result of the state government failing to support its own proposal for the cross river rail project, they are now proposing that they will rip out the seats from the trains so people will have to stand up on the trains. That is the alternative infrastructure vision of those opposite.

What the NBN has done in places like Blacktown, where it has been rolled out in the electorates of Greenway and Chifley, is provide economic opportunity. If those opposite have their way, as has been identified, some people in the community will have the NBN and some people will not. They will have a second-rate system. That is of enormous regret.

Those opposite have not done that. I note that it was a National Party member who came up with 'fraudband'. I say very clearly that the shadow minister for 'fraudband' and the copper economy should be embarrassed by his party's position, because to have fibre to some and copper to others after it goes through what the member for Wentworth says is a bar fridge on the corner of particular streets is just extraordinary. He acknowledges it is essentially a fridge-like large structure which will appear all over the suburbs. Every single one of those fridges will be a symbol of the backward nature of those who want to keep us in the copper age rather than the fibre age.

This budget invests record amounts in community-driven investment. In the budget we have built on our existing commitment to regional Australia, through the Regional Development Australia Fund, to finance very important infrastructure projects that address the specific economic and community needs of all of our regions.

Already 75 projects are under way ensuring people living in rural and regional Australia are getting the services and support that they need, supporting the improvement and construction of regional infrastructure, community sporting and youth associations and cultural projects across regional Australian communities.

They are two very important areas of the island and are in desperate need. We have also been extending the operation of the Reconstruction Inspectorate and the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce to ensure that every cent of our flood-rebuilding package goes where it is needed and helps flood-affected communities to rebuild their roads, bridges, rail lines and public facilities so that they can get their lives back on track.

It is important also as part of this budget that we recognise the important role that local government plays across this country. The budget includes funding, as we have been debating, to conduct a referendum on the financial recognition of local government in the Australian constitution. That referendum will be held on the same date as the 2013 election and $10 million has been funded for a national civics campaign and education campaign, which is to provide information to the general public about the referendum. It is some time since we have had a referendum. There are generations of kids who have not had exposure to what that means and they will be voting for the first time, so the civics education campaign is very important.

The minister here will talk a little more about that. There is also additional funding being provided in the sports portfolio. We want to continue the very successful, Active After-school Communities program. It is a terrific program that has been doing great work in small and large schools across the country. The program is extended for one calendar year until December 2014. The program also supports around 2,000 primary schools and 1,200 out-of-school care services to provide quality sport programs.

Our commitment in this budget to regional Australia and its long-term economic and social sustainability is strong. It is something that members on this side of the House have felt very passionately about for a long time and I am very pleased that in this budget we continue that commitment to regional Australia.

Why is all of Australia considered regional Australia? Why aren't regional Australia funds just for regional areas? Why are the capital cities included in regional Australia funding? Weren't you smart enough to develop an urban development fund and a regional fund? Because what you are doing is taking money out of the bush and putting it directly back into the city.

Is the shadow member saying that there were no area consultative committees in city areas? I have a recollection that there were five area consultative committees covering the area of Melbourne and that they put in applications under the Regional Partnerships programsâ€”and, I think, were successful. I have a vague recollection too of an inner Sydney area getting support under the Regional Partnerships programâ€”for a project on a beach.

Let me go to one particular project announced out of round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund which was raised by the shadow ministerâ€”the project in Werribee. I do not know whether you have ever visited Werribee, but let me suggest to you that you might want to do that. When I was in Werribee with the Prime Minister announcing that

She was originally born in my electorate in Trawalla, where Jim Scullin was bornâ€”I am very proud to have that association. She talked about how Werribee was a town of 8,000 people when she first moved there. It is, and was always viewed as, a country town. My sister moved there 20 years ago. It is a tiny country town. It has faced enormous population growth, which is terrific.

So you know that Werribee is a country town which has faced enormous pressure from population growth exploding out of Melbourne. The community had a tiny basketball stadium which was servicing a huge population. The opportunity to make that a regional sporting facility, a centre for basketball for the west of Victoria, is a terrific opportunity.
                                                                                                                    </p>

It is not just about regional provincial cities; it is also about regions and regional areas that cover a whole raft of areas. I know, having been in this area for a while, that the shadow minister is committed to making sure that we have good policy across our regions. I remind the shadow minister that, under the Regional Partnerships program, you did fund a whole raft of projectsâ€”some of which were successful and some of which were questionable, to be quite honest, particularly those in the private sectorâ€”and perhaps you might want to reflect on that when you ask a question.

It has made a really big difference to my area. This budget commits almost $1 billion through the Regional Development Australia Fund, to finance infrastructure projects throughout the nation. I am very proud that we have delivered so much.

That received $5 million from in the previous round of RDAF funding. It is a great investment in our area. That is to complete and do some major upgrades on our netball and tennis courts. When it is completed we will have an international-style facility for tennis and netball which we can be really proud of.

Finallyâ€”we have another very important one--$2 million from this government was delivered for Australia's first high-performance surfing centre at Casuarina. We actually have the world's only high-performance centre or surfingâ€”a great institute at Casuarina, just near Kingscliff. We have a lot of surfing greats that will come there and provide a mentoring service for young people. We are very proud to have the world's first. It truly remarkable.

What you see from this government is real investment in real projects right throughout regional Australia and right across the board, whether it is roads, health facilities or community infrastructure. I have seen firsthand the benefits of all these facilities and the difference that they make. I would certainly like to hear a bit more from the minister, and I would like the Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories to outline the importance of this government's support for regional Australiaâ€”particularly touching on our Regional Development Australia Fund and the difference that it makes local communities like mine.

Regional Development Australia Fund round 3 has been a very successful round. We took the opportunity after each round to review, to listen to stakeholders and to go out and talk to the RDA network about what was happening with that round. One of the things that we were fed back was that often it was difficult for small communities and small towns to compete against larger councils. So that round was specifically designed for towns under 30,000. I was really delighted to see that round fund some 79 projects right the way across the country and in some communities that are very disadvantaged and which would not previously have had the opportunity to apply for that funding of up to $500,000â€”many applications were smaller than thatâ€”and make a substantial difference across each of those rounds.

There has been significant investment by this government in improving the terrible divide that occurs in this country between city people who are diagnosed with cancer and people who live in regional and rural Australia who are diagnosed with cancer.

Again I reiterate how incredibly important those reforms are because of the loading on the basis of size and locational disadvantage and what that means for regional students. I cannot overemphasise how critical that investment is to regional Australia. I think that the

It is not something we often admit to but I know many regional MPs on this side of the House are very fond of members of the National Party. We share a lot in common in terms of the seats we represent. We do not often say that. I know many National Party members are of good heart and understand that the education reforms are a significant advantage to regional Australians and to many regional and rural schools.
                                                                                                                       </p>

In New South Wales, the National Party education minister absolutely gets it. This is critical. Our students in regional Australia are going to be left behind if we do not deal with this issue, if we do not put serious investment into our education system and increase funding on the basis of location and size. It is absolutely critical that we do so. The bills have now passed the House of Representatives. I certainly hope they pass the other place. What I absolutely hope is that the politics we have seen played out across the country is put asideâ€”about not wanting, in someone's political spin doctoring mind, to give the government an advantage if Gonski gets through, that we cannot possibly allow them a win. I hope that sort of commentary, which we are seeing from Liberal and National Party coalition governments in some states, is put aside and that we see increases in funding to regional students. There are some $6 billion that regional and rural schools will benefit from; under the opposition's policy $16 billion will be cut. I hope the Nationals see sense on this.

I congratulate the member for Ballarat for her rise on 25 March to be Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories. I am sure she will do a good job. I also acknowledge the fact that the member for Eden Monaro on 4 February was appointed Minister for Defence Materiel. It is good that Labor is finally recognising that they should have ministers from the bush, from rural Australia. Correct me if I am wrong here; howl me down if you will.

                                                                                                                               I will briefly cover a couple of points. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that you have pointed to funding under Regional Development Australia round 3 that was in your electorate. I am happy that that project has been widely welcomed in your electorate, as it has been across the 79 project areas that were funded under that. I think that round has been a very good round and some good lessons were learned about the importance of supporting smaller rural communities as part of that. I know members here also had a number of projects in their own electorates that have been important as well.
                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               The member for Maranoa, a good representative of regional Australia, got four projects under round 3 in his electorateâ€”with three projects totalling $1.2 million. I was very disappointed that I did not get, 'Yes, that's fantastic; we got three projects' and all I got, 'Where's my fourth?' I have to say that was very disappointing. I heard him on ABC regional radio bemoaning the fact that the fourth project did not get up. He was saying, 'I don't just want the three projects; I want more and I'm disappointed.' He also said that it was a rort and everything had gone down the eastern seaboard. Frankly, I was disappointed that he called it a rort in the sense that he got three projects and not four.
                                                                                                                              </p>

They will be announced over the course of the next month and I am looking forward to visiting many communities across the country to announce those projects. I was very pleased to announce the project in Werribee, which we discussed briefly before. Another project that we announced was in Sydney. Again, this is a very important arts and cultural precinct, which will be very important for that region. I know that it will make a substantial difference there. Also, a project that was announced in my own electorate, in Ballarat, was a regional soccer facility. Another very important project was announced in the member for Corangamite's electorate, not in my electorate, which I am sure he will have much to say about.
                                                                                                                              </p>

There were a number of hours of debate on them. So I say to the member for Cowper that the Senate estimates really did cover all of those questions.

The Active After-schools Community program is a fantastic program, and it has been largely rolled out in my electorate. We have a fantastic number of schools involved in it, and I do want to commend it to the government and also the continuation of its funding, Minister. Then there is the Creative Young Stars Program, which was announced recently and the $27,000 for every electorate. I congratulate the minister on that. I suppose he can read about it

Like many councils, they were determined to learn from round 1, and they were successful in round 2. Effectively, they got $520,000 from us, along with their investment. What is so fantastic about these programs is that you get the co-investment of the communities, and so $531,000 will be put towards revamping what we call the Dial Regional Sports Complex. This funding has allowed the community to completely redo the surface, which will make it an all-weather surface and, at the same time, fix up a lot of the seating, as well as revamp the administration building and associated other builds. The Central Coast Council is a council that does not ask for much, unless it is in their pitching itself as well. This is a genuine regional sports complex, carrying out really important workâ€”and that is, first and foremost, the health and wellbeing of our region and communities. A lot of RDA funding is associated with community health programs, so it is great for infrastructure and also very, very important for the health and wellbeing of our communities.

This is very important, particularly in rural and regional Australia as we are challenged economically in a number of areas for a whole variety of reasonsâ€”it is a fact. These projects are very important for stimulating and sustaining employment. One thing that I forgot to add about the regional sports complex projectâ€”and, hopefully, Minister, you will be able to open it when it is completedâ€”is that it involves improved lighting so that we will be able to have night programs for the region. I do congratulate the Central Coast Council on gaining that funding.

What have we got? The minister came over just recently: $500,000 to a project of well over a million dollars to completely upgrade the terminal. It is going to not only provide better amenity on the island but bring in even more tourists. There are no cows in this terminal! It is a fantastic project, and congratulations to the council. Minister, I am sure you will be able to enlighten us on other similar rural and regional projects and the importance of them to local communities.

This government has undertaken and designed it to help young people to achieve their full potential in the arts, creative industries, community service and the educational sector by developing their skills, abilities and professional connections and, as we said, opening up opportunities for work.
                                                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                                                  This is a similar program to the program we have developed in the area of sports. We do not want Australians just to be seen as brilliant sportsmen; we also want to see our National Cultural Policy develop in a creative Australia accessible to the young people of Australia. Creative Young Stars will see young people up to 25 years of age with the ability to apply for $8 million allocated across Australia to every federal seat equally. Grants are in four categories, for performing arts, cultural activities, academic endeavour and school and community achievement. The grants will help gifted young people to participate in such events as eisteddfods, public-speaking tournaments and cultural, artistic and academic eventsâ€”and, just like Mr Morrison recommended, in events like Generations in Jazz, which took place in Mount Gambier for the 25th year.

Individuals are able to access $500 and groups are able to get grants of $3,000 for groups of six or more members. The grants for Creative Young Stars open on 1 June and close on 21 June. You can visit the youth.gov.au website for information and application forms and I expect it will be of great use to all members of parliament, not just government members. We are expecting enthusiastic participation on behalf of the young people in your electorates in regional and rural Australia as well as right across all of the cities. I pay great tribute to the Office for the Arts which, if members of parliament are not energetic enough, is going to follow up through all the regional art networks, making sure that young people right across this countryâ€”not just where there are active members of parliamentâ€”can access this wonderful program.
