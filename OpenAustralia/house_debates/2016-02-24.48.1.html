        I rise today to announce a much-appreciated funding boost from the federal government to enhance mental health services in a town in the northern goldfields of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        . Leonora has been in the media for all the wrong reasons, with escalating alcohol-fuelled violence and a recent spate of Indigenous suicides. In such a small community no-one is untouched by these tragic events. Indigenous community leaders approached me late last year concerned about the deteriorating fabric of their community. I appealed to ministers Tudge and Scullion to visit as soon as possible. Both responded immediately. Minister Scullion released his Indigenous suicide response strategy in Kalgoorlie in late January, and Minister Tudge came twice to assess the situation for himself. In Leonora Minister Tudge participated in a community forum of shire representatives, Indigenous leaders and key community stakeholders. Jane Waterton, the town's only drug and alcohol counsellor, outlined the need for enhanced on-the-ground mental health and addiction support to help mitigate the ongoing issues that are driving Aboriginals to self-harm and even suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        To this end Minister Tudge, in his capacity as the assistant minister for social services, worked hard to secure an additional $510,000 in funding for the next two years. Centacare will use this extra funding to expand the scope and reach of their Family Mental Health Support Services, which provide non-clinical, early-intervention support to children and other young people suffering depression, anxiety, stress or other behaviours. It is my hope that Kalgoorlie-based Centacare will work closely with professionals like Jane Waterton who are resident in Leonora to provide a comprehensive in situ care and support program. I thank Minister Tudge for this extra funding to ensure that at-risk individuals across the northern goldfields have the best chance of a healthy future.
