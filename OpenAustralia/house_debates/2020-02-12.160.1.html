        and State Emergency Service personnel have been on the frontline, protecting our community and our fellow Australians across the state. The Penrith State Emergency Service were out in force over the weekend working through over 470 requests for assistance, clearing trees and debris on the roads, and they completed 15 flood rescues, including of one man who was clinging to a tree after being washed away in his car at the Kingsway at

        I have talked a lot about the community spirit in Lindsay, particularly over this challenging summer, and for good reason. While the

        have stood up and asked, 'What can I do to help?' It has been overwhelming to see donations coming in to assemble our community care kits and to deliver them where they're needed most after people have been impacted by these terrible bushfiresâ€”home kits, school kits and fireys' kits.

        It is appropriate that, among the fires, torrential rain and localised flooding, on

        Malcolm is not the only outstanding member of our community who was rightly recognised on Australia Day this year. A number of outstanding citizens were recognised, including Captain of the Orchard Hills RFS for 17 years, Greg Speed; local tennis legend and life member of the Nepean District Tennis Association, Dennis Sales; Malcolm Towle, Superintendent of

        Lindsay is truly filled to the brim and overflowing with community spirit, and, with people like these in our community, you can see why. Whether it has been responding to the bushfires that have been impacting our state or whether it has been getting out and lending a helping hand when people have needed help over the weekend with localised flooding, I couldn't be prouder of my community of Lindsay.
