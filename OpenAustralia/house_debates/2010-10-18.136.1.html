        I rise to inform the House about a major piece of community infrastructure that the Gillard Labor government is delivering in the Moreton electorate. We are partnering with the state and local governments, as well as the community sector, to deliver a community hub in Moorooka. The Gillard government has committed $3 million towards this project, which will locate a number of community services at one location on the corner of Beaudesert and Evans Roads, Moorooka. Brisbane’s south side is home to hundreds of active community groups who work to make this area better for everyone to live, work and play. These groups represent various interests. They include the Salisbury
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , multicultural groups, sporting clubs, volunteers, charities and support groups, churches, seniors groups, disability groups and neighbourhood groups, just to name a few. The value of these groups to the south side cannot be underestimated. They are the heart and soul of our community. Whilst some more established groups, such as churches and sporting clubs, have their own facilities, unfortunately many—even the Salisbury RSL—do not have a place to call home. These groups have a pressing need for a public space where they can meet together, hold community functions, store equipment and resources, grow their organisations and, most importantly, engage with the rest of us on the south side for special events. That is why I took this plan for a community hub to the last election.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Finn" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , have brought their enthusiasm and strong links with our local community to this project, making it a true government-community partnership. Brisbane City Council and the state government will be providing the land and then the community groups and the federal government will be providing some of the funding. Over the coming weeks and months we will begin consultation with the community about the exact kind of facility that we will build, but it is expected to include a 200-seat auditorium, a community hall, meeting spaces, storage facilities, a library and some commercial space. We are also working with the Brisbane Housing Co. to develop up to 60 units on the site, through a great blend of the experience of Brisbane Housing Co. in managing such projects and also their great expertise in delivering. So the community hub will be located on the corner of Beaudesert and Evans Roads, Moorooka, the former tram turning circle. It has excellent public transport access via the buses on Beaudesert Road and by the trains just down the road at Salisbury, Rocklea and Moorooka train stations. I will keep the House up to date on the progress of this important community project for Brisbane’s south side. I travel past this little block of land every morning on the way to work so I am particularly keen to make sure that it takes shape, and as someone who lives in Moorooka I know how important the need is in this area.
