        Australian cycling has a long and proud history, most notably dating back to Sir Hubert ‘Oppy’ Opperman, who was Australia’s greatest cyclist of his time and who held many world records in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1951 there was the great ride from all over Australia to Canberra, and there was the centenary ride in 2001 to celebrate 100 years since Federation.

        There are many great cycling moments of significance and importance in our history, from the opening up of the Tour de France by people like

All Australians are proud of his efforts and are hoping for bigger results in the future. Cadel, we are all with you in your efforts.

The elite road cyclist of the year was Cadel Evans from Victoria, who, at the peak of his career in 2008, was on the podium for second place in the Tour de France and who, despite an injured knee, finished fifth in the time trial in Beijing and 15th in the road race at the

She fought back from a broken neck to secure a start in Beijing and won an Olympic Games silver medal in the sprint. That was a fantastic effort from her.

        The Scody 2008 People’s Choice Cyclist of the Year was awarded to Anna Meares, a truly great Australian who overcame great adversity to be recognised for all her efforts and the silver medal that she won. For me whether it is a silver medal or any medal, it is gold, gold, gold all the way for her efforts. The biggest gong of the evening was the Sir Hubert Opperman Medal and Trophy. It was a wonderful evening and to have that presented to Anna Meares was a great finale to a fantastic event.
