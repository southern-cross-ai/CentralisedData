       <p>
        [by video link] My electorate has been one of the hardest hit in Victoria, both in terms of case load and job loss. The people of Fraser watched in horror as too many people in aged-care facilities suffered more than they should have when plans were implemented too slowly or were under resourced. Today I draw attention to the inadequacies of the budget for the people of Fraser. Even before COVID, the female underemployment rate was over 11 per cent in this area. The female underutilisation rate—those who were unemployed plus those who want more hours—was over 17 per cent. That's almost one in five—a shocking statistic.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to being in harm's way, in so many front line positions it was women who bore the brunt of the economic impact of this recession. A telling point of difference between the government and those on this side is the long-term, reform-driven plan to expand access to child care that was laid out by the Leader of the Opposition. This was in stark contrast to the silence of those opposite on the issue of female participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        To those left unemployed by this recession I say, 'You deserved better.' This government somehow managed to rack up a trillion dollars in debt but couldn't say a word or find a single dollar for those on JobSeeker. People have rightly asked me why the budget couldn't provide more clarity beyond a few weeks, particularly heading into Christmas. The budget spent a lot of money, but the government did so without an eye to the future and while continuing to leave far too many people behind.
