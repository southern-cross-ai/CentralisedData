        I seek leave to move the following motion:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes the:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Prime Minister's statement in the House on Monday this week that "Whether they're politicians, journalists, public officials, anyone—there is no-one in this country who is above the law";

        I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Manager of Opposition Business moving the following motion immediately:
