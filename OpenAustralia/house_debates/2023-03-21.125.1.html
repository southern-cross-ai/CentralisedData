        Today is the first opportunity I have had to rise and record my congratulations to and appreciation of the citizens in my electorate of Hindmarsh who were recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Honours List for 2023. I want to recognise: Dr Elizabeth Coates AM, who was recognised for her significant service to special needs dentistry and oral health care; my friend Ms Mary Patetsos, who was recognised for her very significant service to multicultural Australia and to aged care through a range of different board positions; Mr Geoffrey Ambler
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , for service to the community of Salisbury; Mr Russell Duncan OAM, for service to the community through not-for-profit organisations; Mrs Jennifer McDonald OAM, for service to conservation and the environment; Mrs Helen Bales, who received the Australian Corrections Medal; and Mrs Donna Dunbar, who received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSM" rel="nofollow">
         PSM
        </a>
        , for outstanding public service to the residents and employees of the City of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Sturt
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to place on record my extraordinary delight at seeing the recognition of the service of Alexandra Vakitsidis, now Alexandra Vakitsidis OAM, for her service to the Greek community of the western suburbs of Adelaide. I was delighted to be able to provide a reference for her nomination for that award. I have had the pleasure of knowing Alexandra for almost my entire time as the member of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        and then as the member for Hindmarsh. Alexandra migrated to Australia at just 17 years of age, about 55 years ago, and has not wasted a day since that time giving back to her community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2010 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council" rel="nofollow">
         World Council
        </a>
        of Hellenes Abroad awarded Alexandra the woman of the year award for her promotion of Greek culture in Australia, Asia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . A few years later, in 2015 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox Church
        </a>
        honoured Alexandra with the prestigious Golden Cross Class of the Holy New Martyr Agathangelos of Florina. And a few years after that she was made Citizen of the Year in the City of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Enfield" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide Enfield
        </a>
        . For decade upon decade Alexandra has volunteered tirelessly and provided leadership to the Greek community in the western suburbs of Adelaide, from day-to-day support of older members of her community to the famous Semaphore Greek Festival held on the esplanade down in Adelaide's west. She has always done it with a smile. Every year she leads a choral group to provide funds and fundraise for the hospital research foundation based at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Queen Elizabeth Hospital
        </a>
        and holds her Australia Day barbecue, which I attended, again, with the Premier, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the Treasurer and many other members of the western suburbs. Congratulations to all recipients of Australia Day honours, but particularly to Alexandra.
