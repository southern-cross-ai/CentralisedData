        'You were honourable, you were kind, you were charismatic, you were gentle and you were loving.' These are the words of John

        's proud granddaughters, which so eloquently put in perspective this great man. John sadly passed away last month, losing his battle to mesothelioma. He was a man who embodied everything about community and whose name was synonymous with the Campbelltown region.

        I had been privileged to know John ever since 2005. He was a successful businessman and a mentor to many. John had a profound effect on all of us. He was a gentle man, and family to him was everything. John was also very proud of Australian football, the

       <p>
        On behalf of the member for Werriwa and our families, we offer our deepest sympathies to his John's wife, Jan, and his children, Rod, Jamie, Matthew and Amanda and their families. I'd like to conclude with the words John often used: 'It's nice to be important, but it's really important to be nice.'
