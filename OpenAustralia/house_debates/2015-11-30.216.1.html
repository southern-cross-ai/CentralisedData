        is well known to some as the Festival State. It is with good reason, as the arts community in my state is strong and plays an im1portant role in the community. My own children have been introduced to the arts by

        Earlier in the year I was pleased to host an arts round table with the former Minister for the Arts, Senator George Brandis

        , and members of the arts community in South Australia. It was important to give Hindmarsh constituents who contacted me regarding arts funding an opportunity to speak with the federal arts minister. I have had conversations with the new arts minister,

        , who has said that the intention of the National Program for Excellence In the Arts was that it would be reshaped in the light of feedback from the Australian artistic community. That is what has happened. The government has created the Catalyst program for $32 million over the forward estimates to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">

        in recognition of their important role in supporting small and medium organisations and particularly individual artists who are at the heart of the arts in South Australia. This will take the total Australia Council funding to $783 million over the four years.
