       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge the passing of a wonderful Australian. Patricia Blashki, or Pat as she was to her friends, was an absolute stalwart of the Springvale community for more than half a century. To list some of the things that she was involved in:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital_Appeal" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Children's Hospital Appeal
        </a>
        calculator operator for 52 years; Secretary of the Bush Church Aid Society at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Ascension" rel="nofollow">
         Church of the Ascension
        </a>
        , Springvale for 42 years; convenor and organiser for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Day_of_Prayer" rel="nofollow">
         World Day of Prayer
        </a>
        for 42 years; member of the board of management for Springvale Hospital for 17 years; and volunteer driver and craft work assistant with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Vision Australia
        </a>
        for 32 years. Also, with the Springvale Benevolent Society, she was an absolute pillar of strength, again as a volunteer, over many years. Her activities were acknowledged with an Order of Australia in 1995 and she was a City of Greater Dandenong Living Treasure.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was so much more than all of that. She was married for 69 years to her loving husband, Albert Blashki, who has survived her and I know will be struggling with the very great loss. Albert was mayor on repeated occasions and a councillor for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Springvale" rel="nofollow">
         City of Springvale
        </a>
        for many years. I had the honour of succeeding him to that council in 1991.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was also the mother of six children, the grandmother of 16 grandchildren and the great-grandmother of 14 great-grandchildren, and there is still more on the way. She was a great Australian. She is someone who her family can be very, very proud of. I know she leaves many friends behind who will look back and say, 'This was a woman of great character and great care.'
