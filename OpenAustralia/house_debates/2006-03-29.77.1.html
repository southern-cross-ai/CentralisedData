        My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister inform the House how the Australian government and the banks are working to help the people affected by tropical

         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. As I said to the House yesterday, like many Australians, and many
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         ers in particular, including those that have been affected by the devastation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Larry" rel="nofollow">
          Cyclone Larry
         </a>
         , he has been working tirelessly to make sure that people can return to their normal lives as quickly as possible. It is important to report to the House and to keep the Australian people updated—and the issue fresh in their minds—on just how challenging the circumstances are that continue to impose themselves upon people living in the cyclone affected areas. It is important to give credit to all Australians who have given significant financial support and support in kind.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also recognise that the corporate sector has provided considerable support to the people affected in North Queensland. Today I want to publicly thank the Australian Bankers Association and the banking organisations within North Queensland, as well as the insurance industry, which have acted, on the advice to me, with great speed and have offered great assistance to many people, particularly those in small business and those with housing loans, to help them through this difficult period. The banking industry has provided support by suspending loan repayments in certain circumstances, providing residential business and agricultural loan restructuring without the usual bank fees, refinancing at a discounted fixed interest rate and a waiving of early withdrawal fees for those customers wishing to access term deposits. It is important that the bankers continue to recognise the circumstances that face people affected by Cyclone Larry and I commend them today for their assistance.

         Earlier this morning I spoke with the Minister for Human Services,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
          Joe Hockey
         </a>
         . He is in North Queensland speaking with many families that are affected to see how the Australian government can continue to provide Centrelink services, support and delivery of the announcements that have already been made by the Prime Minister. I assured the Minister for Human Services, as he was speaking to some small business people when he called, that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Taxation Office
         </a>
         —as I reported yesterday—will continue to offer flexibility for those people, particularly farmers, who might have
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAS" rel="nofollow">
          BAS

         s to provide to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         . We do have continued flexibility in support of those people in this devastated region. I commend all of those people who have provided support to those in North Queensland. I can assure the people in that region that the Howard government will continue its considerable support to help them get back on their feet.
