       <p>
        I have some very exciting news to share with the House today about someone who is much loved by all of us here in the parliament: Brigette Bull, better known as Brigette from Aussies. There was an exciting buzz at Aussies when I went there this morning. Upon my arrival, Senator Tim Ayres and the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        were announcing exciting news. Yesterday Brigette's partner, Anthony Wren, proposed to Brigette while they were FaceTiming with her parents, Chris and Kate Bull, who are in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . They were having a nice cross-Tasman chat on a Sunday afternoon when he presented the ring to Brigette and asked her to marry him. I know just how much Brigette has missed her family in New Zealand, particularly over the past few years with COVID disrupting so many travel plans and family reunions. It is obvious that her now fiance recognised the importance of having her parents online for this very special moment. Brigette has been proudly showing off her stunning engagement ring today. Great job, Anthony. Since Anthony has come into Brigette's life, she has started a little later at Aussies. I know the chief whip and I both miss seeing her smiling face first thing each morning. Jo and I are very early risers. Huge congratulations to Brigette and Anthony, and our very best wishes to their parents, Chris and Kate Bull and Wendy Chose, as they celebrate this news and the happy couple begin to plan their wedding. I just hope it doesn't interfere in Brigette giving the member for Macnamara a ribbing about his almond lattes.
