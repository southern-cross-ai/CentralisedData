        For the benefit of members, it is the case that when the House adjourns at a later hour, very soon, the Speaker will suspend the sitting of the House until the bells ring. It is the government’s intention for the House to be resumed on Monday morning at 10 or 11 am or thereabouts. I say it is the intention because we are obviously going to deal with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
         CPRS
        </a>
        . I can inform the House that there are 295 amendments to be moved in 35 groups. So far, two of the 295 amendments have been debated by the Senate. Therefore, it is the intention of the government to consult with the Speaker, as is proper practice. We will also consult with the Manager of Opposition Business about the precise time of recall. A recall time of 10 am does allow members in

        and Tasmania, I understand, to come here on Monday morning, but it may well be that if the Senate continues then to save the cost of bringing back the House the recall will occur at a later time. I am sorry that we cannot be more precise—

         Or perhaps a later day. That is in the hands of the Senate. We will, as we have on these matters, continue to consult the opposition. We have been constructive in how we have tried to do this.

           And of course the crossbenches. That is as precise as we can be at this moment. Some people will be able to get home this evening and spend tomorrow in their electorates. But people can expect to be back here on Monday morning to deal with the amendments. It is also envisaged, following discussions between the government and the opposition this morning—both the House of Representatives and Senate office holders—that we would have an agreed time of conclusion of that debate in this House so that there can be some certainty about members’ travel times and also, it must be said, certainty for the staff not just of members of parliament but of the parliament itself. I thank the House.

            Madam Deputy Speaker, I would make an observation to the Leader of the House on indulgence. I appreciate that you cannot give us a definite time, and I am not being critical of that at all, but many members actually have to leave home on Sunday at midday or thereabouts. So if perchance the House is not sitting on Monday notification on Saturday would be very helpful.

             The intention and understanding of the Senate was that the Senate committee stage would be completed by 3.45 pm on Friday. That is a reasonable thing for the Senate to have done to allow proper debate. That will allow members to be notified late on Friday about whether this sitting will resume at 10 am on Monday.
