        Last Friday I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        Show—the 80th anniversary of what I consider to be the best small island show in Australia. There was something for every age group: wood chopping displays, farm machinery, dog agility courses, a quick shearing display, rides for the kids, a grand parade—with a vintage Citroen that would not look out of place in your driveway—sheep and cattle judging; just to name a few of the attractions on offer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The catering was looked after by my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        colleagues on Flinders Island. And, once again, they did not disappoint: scallop pies, wallaby pies, beautiful lamb wraps, and the best chips north of Launceston. The wonderful Pura Graham was named Flinders Island Citizen of the Year. Pura is an icon on Flinders Island, with an extraordinary generosity of spirit. Hector Grimshaw was the Lions Club Young Citizen of the Year, a community-minded young man with a bright future.

        I congratulate all of the organisers, particularly the Show Committee President, Louise Angel; Secretary/Treasurer, Robyn Dilger; and the other members of the Show Society who made the 80th anniversary of the Flinders Island Show one to remember. I encourage everyone to put a diary place marker in their 2015 diary for the 81st Flinders Island Show and enjoy this jewel in the crown of the

        group.

        I spoke about Peter earlier this year in my address-in-reply speech, thanking him for his tireless work in the 2013 Kingston election campaign. He did have ongoing health issues but it did not stop him from being out there on the polling booth on election day. I offer his siblings, Bill, Robert and Mary, and his daughters, Chloe and Sophie, my sincere condolences, and I pay tribute to Peter's contributions to the Labor movement.
