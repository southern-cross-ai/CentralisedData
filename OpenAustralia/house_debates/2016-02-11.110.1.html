        My electorate is named after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River" rel="nofollow">
         Swan River
        </a>
        , and anyone who has been to Perth would know that the Swan is a very popular spot for kayaking, canoeing and many other water sports with its flat, shallow waters and accessible banks. The sport of kayaking and canoeing, which is an Olympic sport, is run by Canoeing Western Australia under the guidance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Rosalie Evans. Rosalie has visionary and exciting plans for the sport in WA, and I met with her twice over the course of the Christmas break to lend my support for construction of a Perth whitewater centre, which is close to becoming a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 13 December I visited the preferred site on the banks of the Swan River in Burswood. The centre would include an Olympic-length slalom course, with facilities for whitewater canoeing, kayaking, rafting and surfing, similar to the renowned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_International_White_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Cardiff International White Water
        </a>
        park in Wales. The point of difference for Perth, though, is that this centre would be built right next to the Swan River, so you could imagine the great opportunities there would be for kayakers to train in both the slalom and distance forms of the sport from the one base. Another reason Burswood has become the preferred site is that the Burswood Peninsula is being transformed into the new Perth stadium precinct, with the new stadium to open in 2018. I again congratulate the Liberal state government for opening up the possibilities on the Burswood Peninsula by making the decision to build their new stadium there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Canoeing WA have had a private investor that is committed to building the centre for some years now, and all that remains to make this a reality is an arrangement to be made with the WA government to purchase the land. I have been able to put Rosalie in touch with the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         South Perth

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
         John McGrath
        </a>
        , who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier and who can provide her with some further advice on how to take this further. I think the private investor has seen a huge potential here. There is a large local market but also a big market for European athletes seeking opportunities to train in the warm climate during winter months. We also have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_Descent" rel="nofollow">
         Avon Descent
        </a>
        in Perth. It is an international 124-kilometre whitewater event held each year. I note that the plans for a Perth whitewater centre have been on the table since 1998, when the Harvey International Slalom Course was closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember our dear friend and the former member for Swan and Canning Don Randall tried to get a whitewater park up and running at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         Champion Lakes
        </a>
        and secured a $5 million commitment from the coalition at the 2010 election, although the coalition were not able to form a government after that election. I congratulate Rosalie on her vision and will do what I can to help progress this and continue the transformation of the Burswood Peninsula into a sporting precinct in my electorate of Swan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I will briefly mention a campaign called Swim and Survive that I helped launch with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Life_Saving_Society_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Life Saving Society Australia
        </a>
        and Rosalie on 20 January at the Ascot Kayak Club. The campaign is aimed at promoting water safety on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        on the Swan River and in the lead-up to Australia Day as many people flock to the river to watch the Skyworks each year at 8 pm. The royal life saving is now doing some of their bronze course in the Swan River, and I congratulate them and all those associated with them.
