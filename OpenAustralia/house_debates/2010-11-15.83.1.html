        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Will the minister outline to the House the implications of last week’s High Court decision on the processing of asylum seekers? How has this decision been received and what is the government’s response?

         I thank the honourable member for her question.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursday" rel="nofollow">
          Last Thursday
         </a>
         the High Court delivered its decision on the challenge to refugee processing of offshore arrivals. It is very important to be clear about what this decision did and did not do. The court has found that the refugee status assessments and independent merits review is subject to judicial review in some circumstances relating to procedural fairness. Importantly, this decision has no impact on the government’s capacity to establish a regional processing centre which would be operated as part of an international framework. However, there are doubts and serious questions about whether decisions made by Australian government officials in third country processing would be subject to judicial review where they are not part of an international agreement and where they are not partnered with international organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that the opposition have sought legal advice on the issue of whether the Nauru solution would be made impractical by the High Court’s decision. They got it from their preferred independent and impartial legal adviser, Senator Brandis. I am sure the House will be relieved to know that, after deep consideration in his chambers, Senator Brandis has given the opposition policy a big tick and cleared it on legal advice. But you do not always have to get legal advice from somebody who happens to be the shadow Attorney-General. There are other lawyers in Australia. For example, Julian Burnside

              Mr Burnside said, ‘I think there is a respectable argument that if officers of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Commonwealth
              </a>
              operating in Nauru make a life and death decision they also would be subject in the same way to review that the High Court has said today.’
             </p>
             <p>
              It is important when considering implications of the High Court case that we base our policy responses on the consideration of the facts. I noticed on
              <i>
               Lateline
              </i>
              on Thursday night the member for Cook was asked to respond to my suggestion that the so-called Nauru solution might be caught up in the High Court case. The member for Cook said this:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Well, if
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen" rel="nofollow">
               Chris Bowen
              </a>
              ’s right, then that means the 47,000 applications that were made offshore for protections visas in Australian missions and with Australian officials around the world or the thousands of other applications that are made for skilled visas and others would all be reviewable by the High Court.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is what the member for Cook said—‘If Chris Bowen’s right, this would need to be true.’ Guess what? It is true. The honourable member for Cook appears to be unaware that those applications are subject to judicial review by Australian courts. It just goes to show that when it comes to policy it is important to be good at more than sound grabs. It is also important to be good at sound policy, which the honourable member for Cook and his colleagues appear not able to be. The government will continue to work through the implications of the High Court decision in a calm and methodical manner, and the opposition might care to do the same in relation to the High Court implications for their own policy.
