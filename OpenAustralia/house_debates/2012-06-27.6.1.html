        Introduction
       </p>
       <p>
        Twelve months ago, the government announced
        <i>
         Streamlining Australia's anti-dumping system
        </i>
        a policy document that set out the most significant reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system in over a decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased today to present the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 3) 2012, which is the fourth and final tranche of legislation to implement the reforms in this policy document.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I foreshadowed in March, when I introduced the third tranche of legislation, this fourth bill implements reforms across three broad areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, it will better align Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system with those of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
         WTO
        </a>
        counterparts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, it introduces provisions designed to address the circumvention of trade measures. These important amendments establish, for the first time, a mechanism for Australian industry to apply to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Customs
        </a>
        and Border Protection Service for an inquiry into business practices which are designed to avoid the payment of dumping or countervailing duties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, it strengthens our system's ability to address parties' non-cooperation during the investigation process.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also makes a number of minor corrections to Part XVB of the Customs Act 1901.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now step through each of these in detail. Aligning subsidies provisions with the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the bill amends the provisions dealing with countervailable subsidies to more accurately reflect the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. In particular, this bill:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Anti-circumvention inquiries
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, this bill introduces a new division in Part XVB of the Customs Act, Division 5Aâ€”Anti-circumvention inquiries. This division will allow Australian industry, or the minister, to initiate an anti-circumvention inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Circumvention is a trade strategy used by the exporters and importers of products to avoid the full payment of dumping or countervailing duties. Circumvention activities take various forms and exploit different aspects of the anti-dumping and countervailing system. For example:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Division 5A empowers the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs_and_Border_Protection_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Customs and Border Protection Service
        </a>
        to inquire into those circumvention activities and provide the minister with a report recommending whether the original notice should be altered or remain the same. As a result of these amendments, the minister will be able to extend the original notice imposing the anti-dumping measures to cover the circumvention activities of exporters or importers if the minister is satisfied that, as a result of the prescribed circumvention activity, the duties which would have otherwise been paid on imported goods have not been paid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stronger provisions to address non-cooperative parties
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, this bill strengthens the provisions that deal with non-cooperation in sampling exercises in investigations, continuation inquiries or reviews under Division 5 of Part XVB of the Customs Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sampling exercises are undertaken where the number of exporters who provide information is so large as to make a determination for each individual exporter impracticable. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will be able to limit the examination either to a reasonable number of exporters which are a statistically valid sample, or to the exporters who are responsible for the largest percentage of the volume of the exporters from the country in question which can reasonably be investigated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, an exporter of goods which are the subject of an investigation must have been either a selected exporter or a residual exporter. A residual exporter would generally receive a duty equal to the weighted average of the examined selected exporters' duty rate imposed by the measures. This would normally be more than the rate for an exporter who failed to cooperate in the investigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service's view has been that residual exporters only exist in cases where the sampling provisions were applied. In a recent Trade Measures Review Officer decision a loophole was identified which could lead to a counterproductive outcome that benefits non-cooperating exporters, that is, they may receive a more favourable rate than the rate provided under the current approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment will prevent potential manipulation of this provision by creating three categories of exporters: cooperative, residual and uncooperative.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, the minister will be able to determine:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        This approach is consistent with the approach taken in a number of other jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This reform will ensure that Australia's anti-dumping system effectively deals with parties that do not cooperate with investigations. This ensures that the minister will have the power to impose tougher dumping margins for parties that refuse to provide necessary information within a reasonable period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill completes the implementation of the legislative reforms outlined in the government's
        <i>
         Streamlining Australia's anti-dumping system
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The 'Streamlining' reforms represent the most extensive improvements to the anti-dumping system in a decade and address long-standing systemic issues such as those identified in the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        But more can be done to ensure that the system can respond to new and emerging trends. For example, there may be more that we can do to address sales at a loss, aimed at avoiding the effect of our anti-dumping system. I am looking at this and other areas where future reform may be required, and will bring forward further legislation for the parliament's consideration if it is needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is still more to do. This bill is an important step, and I commend it to the House.
