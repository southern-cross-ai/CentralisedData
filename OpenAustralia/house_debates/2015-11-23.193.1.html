       <p>
        Today I stand in Australia's federal parliament to warmly congratulate Susan Chow on her richly deserved Victorian Senior of the Year award. Susan has been president of the Fitzroy Chinese Women's Association since 2003 and President of the Fitzroy Chinese Association since 2006. In this time, she has made a huge contribution to my electorate of Melbourne. I am inspired by the Chinese community in Fitzroy and Yarra, because Fitzroy is a place where people care for each other. But we can all learn a lot from the way the Chinese community comes together to share experiences and activities and care for older members of the community. None of this would be possible without the incredible commitment and hard work of Susan and others.
       </p>
       <p>
        For years, Susan has given so much of her time and effort to tirelessly volunteer on behalf of the community. Because of her work, the community has enjoyed regular shared activities and built lasting connections and friendships. If there is one word that all who know her use to describe Susan, it is 'selfless'. I am told that the award won by Susan included a prize of several hundred dollars and, rather than keep this money for herself, she used it to bring together over 100 community members for a free lunch and get-together. These are the values that have made the community what it is today. I have seen Susan in action. At every event that I go to in the Fitzroy Flats, Susan is there bringing people together. Whether it is a joint 80th birthday or a tour being organised in some part of outer Melbourne, Susan is behind it. Thank you, Susan, and the Fitzroy Chinese community for all that you do to make Melbourne a great place for everyone.
