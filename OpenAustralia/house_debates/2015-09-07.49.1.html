        I rise today to speak about last week's Legacy Week, the national appeal to raise awareness and funds for the families of our injured and deceased veterans. I was away for most of the week, for the

        Geraldines', as we are called—but more on that in another speech. I flew back late on Thursday and first thing Friday was out selling Legacy badges at Woden Westfield. A number of people I approached had already bought a badge, and, if they had not, many bought one from me. It was fantastic to see old and young people supporting Legacy Week, sending our veterans and their families a clear message that we care and we will be there for you.

        Legacy Week began in 1942, and the funds raised over the years have helped Legacy assist around 90,000 widows and close to 2,000 children and people with disabilities Australia wide. The funds raised during the week help Legacy provide essential services as such as counselling, special housing, medical services, advocacy and social support. It is a historic and wonderful appeal, and I thank and acknowledge all those involved. In particular, I want to thank Peter Ellerman and Neil Horn, who were coordinating the efforts in Woden. I also want to acknowledge the boys from

        , who were also selling badges in Woden. Thanks, Canberra, for your support of this wonderful appeal.
