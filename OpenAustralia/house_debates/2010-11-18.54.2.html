       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the Tasmanian Bartlett Labor government on its decision to renew its agreement with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorn_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Hawthorn Football Club
        </a>
        and I confirm my support for the continuation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        This deal represents the best for all Tasmanian interests, having both community and commercial benefits, by guaranteeing the continuation of the Hawthorn Football Club playing a minimum of four home and away matches in Launceston over the next five years. This is tremendous news for all of Tasmaniaâ€™s football supporters, as well as for the business community and the tourism industry. It will inject millions of dollars a year into the Tasmanian economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The arrangement between the state government and the Hawthorn Football Club also provides infrastructure investment of $300,000 for the continuing development of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Aurora Stadium
        </a>
        in Launceston. Having Hawthorn games at Aurora Stadium is supported by community
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Aussie Rules
        </a>
        associations in Tasmania. Whilst I continue to have criticisms of the lack of financial support for community Aussie Rules by the AFL, not the least of which is that no draft fees are paid to community football clubs in Tasmania, at least this deal will not disrupt community football rosters, which an unreasonable number of additional AFL games would have done. Once again, I wish to put on the record my full support for the initiative taken by the Tasmanian government and the Hawthorn Football Club in their continuing support of AFL games being played at Aurora Stadium in Launceston.
