        <p>
         Madam Acting Speaker, the procedures of the House are such that the member for Stirling is now entitled to read his suspension of standing and sessional orders motion, and then the Treasurer is quite entitled to use that power under the standing orders. The member for Stirling is entitled to read his motion.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Stirling has the call. He is entitled to seek a suspension and I will allow him to proceed on that basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, Madam Acting Speaker. I move:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Stirling from moving the following motion:That:

             (b)

             proposals stand condemned for failing to recognise and understand the difficult conditions already being faced by small business who cannot afford to face massive cost increases and a one size fits all approach being advocated by the Government;

             recognise that if they don’t change course they will be condemning many small businesses to closure, they will increase costs for consumers and they will be throwing tens of thousands of Australians out of work; and

             Madam Acting Speaker, I would like to raise a matter with you and request that you give it some consideration. In relation to the seeking of leave and suspension this morning, the honourable member for Stirling did seek leave to move his motion. As a matter of courtesy and convenience to the House, the Treasurer rose to indicate that leave would not be granted and that it might be more appropriate for the member to proceed directly to the suspension. I think that is a very courteous way to proceed and it does assist the House in dealing with the matter. I would ask you, Madam Acting Speaker, whether you would consider the matters that I have raised and perhaps, if appropriate, provide some clarity as to the best way of handling these matters.
            </p>

             The Acting Speaker:
            </p>
            <p>
             I thank the Chief Government Whip. I will seek advice and proceed with that. The difficulty is that often people seek leave when they should not be seeking leave, and that confuses the issue. Sometimes when people are rising to speak to motions they seek leave when they did not need to or they do not know at what point they need to seek leave. That confused the matter a little this morning, but I think the Chief Government Whip has a valid point and I will raise the matter with the Speaker.
