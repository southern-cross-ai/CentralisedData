        <p>
         I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The Rudd government have supported Australia’s small businesses through the global recession, and we continue to support small businesses during the economic recovery phase. They need our support because they are still struggling. We recognise that and we want to support them in a number of important ways. But at every turn the coalition in opposition have tried to undermine the support that this government has been providing for small business. The coalition voted against our stimulus package designed to help our tradies and the small businesses that supply them. The coalition have indicated that, if elected, they would scrap the small business tax breaks. Why would you do that? They say they are the party of small business, but they would scrap our small business tax breaks. The coalition have said that they would pull the plug on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         , which would be so important to our small business community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia’s 2.4 million small businesses are required to follow the rules, and we are helping them to do that. We are helping them to follow the rules with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Business_Reporting" rel="nofollow">
          Standard Business Reporting
         </a>
         , which will start on 1 July, enabling small businesses to meet their compliance obligations with the Commonwealth through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Securities and Investments Commission
         </a>
         and to meet their tax obligations with a real reduction in red tape. We are helping small business comply with their superannuation obligations through the superannuation clearing house that will come into force on 1 July again, in just a couple of weeks time. The Rudd government is creating a national business names registration system so that those small businesses that operate across state boundaries do not have to register their business name in each and every state and territory and make those renewals every couple of years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Small business owners, like all Australians, are expected to comply with these basic rules of disclosure and accountability, and parliamentarians are among those Australians who are expected to comply with their obligations of disclosure and accountability. Yet of course the Leader of the Opposition failed for two years to disclose a $700,000—

          Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 98(c):
         </p>
         <dl>
          <dt>
           (c)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible …
           <dl>
            <dt>
             (i)
            </dt>
            <dd>
             public affairs;
            </dd>
            <dt>
             (ii)
            </dt>
            <dd>
             administration; or
            </dd>
            <dt>
             (iii)
            </dt>
            <dd>
             proceedings pending in the House.
            </dd>
           </dl>
          </dd>
         </dl>
         <p>
          The minister for small business has absolutely no responsibility for the pecuniary interests of the House, therefore his answer at the moment could not possibly be relevant to the question he was asked.

          <p>
           First of all, the Manager of Opposition Business has based his point of order on the standing orders relating to questions. I am just indicating that that is the case. Therefore, it relates to the question. The question was in order. He then makes a point that he would like that to then apply to the answer. He quite correctly has understood that he cannot directly use the matters that can or cannot be contained in a question to dictate that. The suggestion is that there is a thread between the intent of the standing orders on the questions and what should be contained in the answers.
           <i>
            House of Representatives Practice
           </i>
           actually has a good discussion about that but has indicated that—despite, from time to time, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Procedure Committee
           </a>
           offering comments—there has been no attempt to address the standing orders. In this case, without ruling the minister out of order, I indicate to the member for Sturt that I will listen carefully to the way in which the minister relates the material that he is producing to the question that was in order.

            Mr Speaker, on the point of order: there are some requirements placed on members as to the reporting of their financial affairs. My clear understanding is that the detail of those amounts is not public property, and nor should it be. Any attempt to disclose that is contempt of this parliament and its standing orders.

                 I was asked whether all Australians, not just small businesses, should meet their obligations of accountability and transparency. Of course, small businesses should meet their obligations of accountability and transparency, and that is what we are helping them to do. But there should be one rule for all Australians, whether they are small business owners, whether they are parliamentarians, whether they are working Australians or whether they are companies—and that is my point. I am not suggesting that this case was anything but an oversight.

                   I really think from time to time that the member for O’Connor should think about the way in which he is not really assisting. One of the things that I have to say as the Speaker is that, when I am asked to make sure that a minister is actually answering a question in a certain way, I am supposed to possess a wealth of knowledge and to know all the answers. I only say that in the context of some comments which have been made by way of interjection in the last minute or two, which I do not know the background of and which are, therefore, a bit difficult for me to act upon. Certain people who are making those interjections should temper them. I am listening carefully to the matters that are now being raised by the minister. I would prefer some members to keep their comments to themselves.

                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was asked: should there be a single standard of reporting and accountability for all Australians, whether they are small businesses or other Australians? And I am directly answering that question. The answer is that there is a double standard. There is a double standard going on in this parliament.

                       Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of view. I listened very carefully before to your quite correct and lengthy description of the standing orders in respect of this matter in relation to my last point of order. I think in addition to what I said before that there is a line of bad taste in this House, which obviously the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister think is reasonable to have crossed on this occasion, but the response from the opposition is, unfortunately, commensurate with the attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I would ask you to ask him to sit down for the benefit of the House.

                             Before I deal with the members for O’Connor and Goldstein, the member for Bowman will go for one hour under standing order 94(a), and I indicate to the House that this is an illustration of the failure of 94(a) because people now think that one hour is a reward. In dealing with the member for Goldstein, he will leave the chamber for one hour under 94(a), because exactly the same thing that he had one hour for he has repeated. The member for O’Connor, because he is displaying things, waving around and interrupting proceedings, will leave for one hour as well.
                            </p>

                             The members for Bowman, Goldstein and O’Connor then left the chamber.
