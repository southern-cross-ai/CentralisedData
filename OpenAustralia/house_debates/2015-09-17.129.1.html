        It is a pleasure to rise to tell the parliament about a few of the schools in my local electorate that are celebrating some significant milestones. I have spoken previously in this House about a couple of schools: Seton College, which had its 50th anniversary last year, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Laurence's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Laurence's College
        </a>
        , which had its 100th anniversary this year, its centenary. It has been an absolute honour to attend some of the events in celebration of those milestones.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wanted to mention a couple of primary schools, each of which has reached 100 years this year. The first I would like to mention is

        State School, which is a school in my local suburb. It has been the centre of the community that it services from its opening in 1915 until the present day. Throughout its life, the school has been the venue for countless events such as dances, socials and concerts, dramatic performances, fancy dress balls, agricultural shows, welcoming home soldiers from the

        , political meetings and elections, cat and dog shows, fetes and fairs, lectern lectures and flower shows. The original 1915 school building was described as the most scientific building in Queensland and a high mark in school architecture. A lot of thought was given to the positioning of the buildingsâ€”

          As I was saying, the school buildings are well known for the work that went into positioning them for the healthy education of children. In 2005 the school was nominated for and secured a place in the

A centenary dinner dance will be held on 23 October, and I certainly wish them well for that and the centenary fete the following day.

          On the weekend I also had the great pleasure of going to the Greenslopes State School, which actually celebrated more than 100 years. It celebrated 125 years, believe it or not. It was opened in 1890 and it was called Mount Pleasant Provisional School at the time and then renamed Dunellan Provisional School as it stands on Dunellan Street. It was the 614th school built in Queensland and on the second day of opening boasted an enrolment of 65 children. Students were drawn to the school from surrounding farms, shops and local industry, and by July 1923 all of the land currently used by the school was purchased and the school was renamed Greenslopes State School. It is an absolutely beautiful school and it was such an honour to get to celebrate the 125th anniversary with the school community that day.
