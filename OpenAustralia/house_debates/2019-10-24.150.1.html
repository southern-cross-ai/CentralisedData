       <p>
        I rise today to speak on two issues affecting my electorate of Macarthur which by now would be well known to members of the House. They are matters that I've sought to bring before the parliament in both the federal and state Liberal-National governments on a number of occasions. The first matter I wish to speak on is Macarthur's unique koala colony. While rapidly developing and being located on the outskirts of metropolitan Sydney, Macarthur possesses a rural charm. It has unique heritage of both Indigenous people and white settlers and is home to a wide array of flora and fauna. The House would be well aware of Campbelltown's uniquely disease-free koala colony and, since being elected to this place in 2016, my consistent calls for its protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        Macarthur's koalas are under threat. Urban sprawl and a lack of adequate environmental protections place the very existence of the colony at risk. Quite frequently we see koalas killed or severely injured as they attempt to cross

        , or face an attack from a dog in a backyard when they have had their habitat destroyed. We need adequate protections put in place to ensure that our disease-free koala colony can continue to thrive. That's why I was pleased to have secured a commitment by the opposition during the last election to provide federal funding to establish a wildlife bridge, in conjunction with upgrades to Appin Road, to preserve our wildlife corridor. I've called upon the coalition to match this commitment, and I do so again today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm of the opinion that development must come to a halt in this area until adequate steps are taken to protect and preserve our region's flora, fauna and heritage. If we don't do that—if we continue with the urban sprawl and development that's already occurred—our flora and fauna will be destroyed. That would be a great tragedy. I'm also calling for the creation of a koala national park in the region to protect our unique colony—a policy taken to the state election this year by my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        Labor colleagues. I recently had the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, along to see the area, and he recognises the importance of preserving our unique flora and fauna, and in particular our koalas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to touch briefly on the government's lack of provision of infrastructure in Macarthur. We are the most rapidly growing electorate in New South Wales, yet transport infrastructure has been sorely inadequate. People face long commutes in their cars on overly congested roads, without the thought of public transport. The government has just walked away, at both a state and a federal level, from providing transport infrastructure for Macarthur. Our region also has overcrowded hospitals. One of our schools has more than 40 demountable classrooms. In a school that was planned for 600 children we now have 1,800 children. It's a great tragedy. Macarthur needs appropriate infrastructure.
