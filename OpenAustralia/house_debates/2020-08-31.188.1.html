        On 22 August I joined the official opening of Ourimbah mountain bike park's newest trail, Amaroo, with Labor Councillor Jillian Hogan. The 1.6 kilometre flow trail combines a smooth, wide track with pumping sections, steep burns, jumps and rollers to create an experience that beginners can enjoy as much as the pros. This new trail was funded by the Central Coast Mountain Bike Club with support through my Stronger Communities Program and a grant from David Harris MP, the state member for Wyong. Secretary of the club, Leif Arnebark, told me, 'Mountain biking is growing rapidly and has an enormous take-up within the general population as a recreational activity. It is an ideal fit for active lifestyles that fits hand in glove with sustainability goals and a green future.' I couldn't agree more. Being outdoors and active is good for your health and wellbeing and fantastic for our community.

        Free, local activities like that offered at Ourimbah are even more important as COVID-19 continues to unfold. Congratulations to President Paul, Secretary Leif, Vice President Dee and Trail Manager Paul for your advocacy and support of mountain biking on the coast.

        With more locals getting active and outdoors due to the pandemic, the timing couldn't have been better for the launch of the new flow trail at Ourimbah mountain bike park. I hope that, when restrictions ease, mountain bikers from outside the coast will add the Central Coast Ourimbah mountain bike park to their itineraries and take a few runs down Amaroo. I thank my cousin Damien and his son Ollie for coming along.
