       </p>
       <p>
        In just a single term of government, the Labor Party has allowed the critical road infrastructure in regional and remote Australia to deteriorate significantly. The current government's approach to road maintenance and the safety of its users has been chaotic, especially for those living in regional areas. In May, the Prime Minister and several other Labor ministers visited Rockhampton for Beef 2024, claiming to support the cattle industry and our region. However, their actions have failed to match their words.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        's beef corridor road network is essential, with nearly a quarter of Australia's cattle herd bred within the 457-kilometre network of roads. I take pride in the fact that the beef produced in my electorate of Capricornia is amongst the best in the world. The 2,300 farmers within this network of roads contribute an astounding $2.7 billion to the Queensland economy. This substantial sum directly funds hospitals, schools and the roads that those of us in urban areas often take for granted. The roads in South-East Queensland are some of the finest in the country, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our cattle farmers, whose efforts generate the funds needed to build them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the immense economic contributions these graziers make to our nation, they are not seeing any return on their hard work. Labor has neglected the very infrastructure that supports one of Australia's most vital industries, demonstrating a lack of respect and appreciation for the contributions of regional and remote communities. Unlike the current government, the former coalition government could see how important the beef corridor road network is for farmers, with interconnected road infrastructure being a critical part of agriculture's supply chain from west Queensland to east Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>

        from Lotus Creek said, 'Proper road infrastructure would expand out markets, increase accessibility to important infrastructure for both our families and business and reduce the disruptive impacts caused by standard weather events.' The coalition recognised the critical need to upgrade these essential roads to enhance supply chains, ensuring that suppliers could deliver their products to the market more quickly and safely. This initiative was aimed at boosting economic activity and creating more job opportunities. With the strong backing of the seven councils in the region, we pledged a substantial $400 million in 2022 to seal 457 kilometres of road infrastructure, bringing it up to 21st-century standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I was shocked and deeply disappointed to learn during Senate estimates earlier this year that the $400 million investment had been delayed until the 2027-28 financial year. This delay is particularly frustrating, given that preparations were already underway, with shovels ready to break ground next year. This decision by the Labor government highlights their blatant disregard for not just the agriculture sector but all those who live and work in regional and rural Queensland. Labor's actions not just are a setback for infrastructure development but also pose a risk to the lives of people who rely on the regional roads for their daily travel. The government's apparent indifference is a serious concern for all those dependent on safe and efficient transportation in these areas. The hazardous road conditions are not only putting lives at risk but also imposing significant financial burdens on business due to the increased cost of maintaining their equipment. These dangerous roads lead to more frequent repairs and higher maintenance expenses, ultimately impacting the profitability and efficiency of businesses that rely on transportation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ken Dillon, a livestock transported from Clermont, stated that the poor road conditions resulted in significant maintenance costs for his trucks, making it their largest expense. Ken said: 'The people who make the decisions aren't where the action is going on but in metropolitan areas. They need to be more hands on, get out and work out what's going on.' This is something I wholeheartedly agree with. The people in the bush, where the wealth of the nation is created, get left behind by decisions made in the cities. Quite frankly, those of us who live in these areas are sick and tired of our regions being bled dry by Labor. The decision by this Labor government to delay the full funding of $400 million is reckless and has created enormous uncertainty for those living and using the roads within the beef corridor network. I call on the minister for infrastructure to step up and reinstate the original funding profile of $400 million back to the 2025-26 financial year start date to ensure that the much-needed road upgrades can begin. This will allow the beef industry to deliver its high-value product to market and get those who use the roads home safely.

           Let's be clear: the Albanese Labor government is delivering the beef corridor road project, something the coalition talked about but didn't deliver in their nine years. The funding for this project has not been delayed. This idea of funding profiles and being cut is simply nonsense. The coalition allocated fake funding to this project. It's another example of all announcement and no delivery from the former coalition government. The reality is that the Queensland government has undertaken rigorous planning for these projects, and they're now moving into the construction phase. Here's the thing: the funding profiles reflect the real deliverable milestones of the project. We're a government focused on actually delivering projects, not issuing press releases alone. Undertaking the proper design, consultation and procurement for these initiatives takes time and ensures the projects that are built are the right ones in the right locations and to the right budget.
          </p>

           is Australia's heartland for beef production. The region is set to benefit from the development and progressive delivery of $500 million in upgrades to priority road projects that support the beef industry in Queensland. Queensland's beef corridor network extends nearly 218,000 square kilometres and runs east to west across Central Queensland—and, yes, I have been there. The strategic web of roads carries world-class beef products and contributes billions to the Queensland and Australian economies. Upgrading the beef corridor network will increase productivity across agriculture and the resource industry and improve safety.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian government is partnering with the Queensland government and working with seven local councils and key industry stakeholders on the identification of short-, medium- and long-term beef road priorities to inform a 10-year Central Queensland beef roads investment strategy.

          </p>
          <p>
           To kickstart the initiative, on 13 March this year the Miles Labor government announced the first stage of construction, with early works expected to commence progressively from 2024-25, and we're getting this done. The project is being funded on an 80-20 basis, with the Albanese government committing $400 million as part of last year's MYEFO and the Queensland government contributing $100 million, including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Transport" rel="nofollow">
            Queensland Transport
           </a>
           and Roads Investment Program 2023-24 to 2026-27. These roads upgrades provide safer and more efficient transport solutions across the area. We are engaging with the local councils and industry stakeholders to develop that 10-year strategy.

           In my own electorate, we're investing $177 million in the

            Warrego Highway
           </a>
           to improve the safety and capacity of this vital transport link. We're investing $470 million of funding for the entire Warrego Highway in the budget. Why is this critical? Because the Warrego is one of Queensland and Australia's main freight corridors and supports the beef supply chains. It's part of a $2.5 billion investment for Queensland in the budget, including $453.5 million in the central west corridor, $111.7 million in the

           pavement strengthening and widening packages 1, 2 and 3, and $45.5 million in the Springsure to Tambo upgrade. Make no mistake: we are partnering with the Queensland government, and we're backing the industry. It's really, really critical.
          </p>
          <p>
           Not long after all of this back in May, including the Prime Minister attending Beef Week, we announced that China was lifting the suspension of imports from several Queensland meat-processing plants, including
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">

          </p>
          <p>
           This is a great outcome for meat processors in my electorate and for workers in my electorate, not to mention the cattle producers and the wider red meat and beef processing industry in Queensland. I want to thank

            I'm proud to second the member for Capricornia's motion as I too understand the importance of the beef industry and the need to upgrade the beef corridors. The motion acknowledges that the cattle industry within the Queensland beef corridor road network consists of a quarter of the Australian cattle herd population. This is an important contribution to the Queensland economy, worth $2.7 billion. The beef corridors consist of a 457-kilometre road network, which serves as a crucial interconnected system for agricultural supply chains spanning from east to west. This infrastructure facilitates the seamless movement of premium beef throughout every stage of the production cycle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beef produced within the beef corridor road network is of world-class quality and is transported on dangerous, substandard roads. But don't just take my word for it; these are some of the comments from local mayors within the councils of the Flynn electorate.

            : two in Rockhampton and one in Biloela. Between them, they employ 2,000 people and rely on delivery of up to 3,000 head of cattle per day. We need to be able to get the road trains from Central Queensland to the Gladstone port via the Capricorn, Burnett and Dawson highways via Dululu, Biloela and Gladstone. Beef corridors will also benefit our tourism industry and other strong export commodities that are transported from western Queensland to Gladstone, like grains, mung beans and chickpeas.'

            , are undertaking their own expansions to process more beef for more domestic and international markets and will rely heavily on improved transportation from across Central Queensland. Growth opportunities also exist at the Gracemere saleyards, which are currently at the mercy of a beef transportation system that hasn't changed since the 1950s. We are calling on the government to establish a reliable and robust corridor road network that will assist councils across Central Queensland.'

            incorporates the Gladstone port access road, which currently does not allow for type 1 road train access. Upgrading type 1 road train access from the Dawson and Capricorn highways to the Port of Gladstone will reduce logistics costs and time. The Port of Gladstone is the gateway to the rich central western hinterland of Queensland and needs more efficient connections throughout the Queensland beef corridors. Accessing the Port of Gladstone can open the door for beef export as well as agricultural exports straight to the Asian markets. This improves supply chains for agricultural inputs and consumables.

            is committed to the ongoing support of the Queensland beef corridors project. Reliability creates confidence, confidence drives opportunity and opportunity creates investment and employment. As a result, regions and communities are revitalised and linkages between our communities improve capacity and the sense of identity for our beef region. Despite our resilience, innovation and early adoption of 21st-century technology and our incredible superiority in genetics, we are burdened with the uncertainty and unnecessary cost that comes from an inexplicable lack of investment in road infrastructure. Our communities deserve better by any measure of ambition or equity? I agree wholeheartedly with their comments.

            In 2022, the former coalition government committed $400 million to make the crucial improvements to the beef corridor roads. I condemn the Labor government for its reckless decision to delay the funding of $400 million to the beef corridor road network upgrades, creating uncertainty around this critical road safety project.

             I'm all for freedom of speech and democracy, but I did think it a little bit strange that the member for Capricornia, who is leaving the chamber, brought this motion for debate today, given the coalition's history on the beef corridor projects. More hide than banana, I would suggest.

              The member for Hawke would get that reference, obviously. It's a common theme of those opposite to talk about important projects but fail to deliver them. They talked about an anticorruption commission but it took a Labor government to deliver it. They promised a budget surplus, but after nine years in office all we saw were plenty of mugs, but they couldn't deliver. A Labor government delivered a budget surplus in just one year, and then the first back-to-back surplus in almost 20 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              They talked about the beef corridor projects, but it's taking a Labor government to actually deliver them. The coalition, when it came to the beef corridor, were more of a beef substitute—sort of like a tofu or something like that. In government they were all talk and no action; all announcement, but no delivery; big hat, no cattle. These are the people we're supposed to believe can build and regulate a safe nuclear power plant inside a decade. I wouldn't trust them to deliver a pizza. The coalition allocated fake funding for the Queensland beef corridor and—as we just heard from the former speaker—before any due diligence was done to ensure its readiness for delivery.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a representative of the great state of Queensland, I'm very happy to inform the House—and particularly the member for Hawke, who is following this debate closely, and the member for Capricornia—that the Queensland government has now undertaken the appropriate due diligence and is proceeding with construction. I know this will come as a shock to those opposite, but to actually deliver projects like the Queensland beef corridor, you need more than just a press release. You need proper design, consultation and procurement—especially in some of the regions where Labor is a little bit short because there's a little bit on in Queensland at the moment. All of those take time. Our focus in government is on actually delivering projects, not just announcing them.
             </p>
             <p>
              This talk from the opposition about delays is quite interesting. As the member for Capricornia knows, the government has made available $401 million of actual funding, with the Queensland state government contributing $100.2 million. In March of this year the Queensland government announced the first stages of construction would begin with the Clermont-Alpha Road in the Mackay, Whitsunday and

              districts; the Alpha-Tambo Road in the Central West district; the Fitzroy Developmental Road—which I've travelled a few times; and the May Downs Road all to receive improvements as part of the Queensland beef corridor projects.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Queensland beef corridor basically spans an area of 218,000 square kilometres right across

              . We're all about getting it done and servicing this important trade part of Australia. It demonstrates our commitment to rural Australia and rural Queensland. In fact, this Labor budget delivered $21.6 billion for Queensland. There are seven local councils involved in upgrading this critical network of road and improving access to the port of Gladstone.

               Labor should fund the beef roads to the tune of $400 million because the stakes are too high not to. It is so important to make sure that we put the right infrastructure in the right place, and as the member for Capricornia says in this important motion, it is vital that these beef roads get the upgrades that they need.

               I appreciate that the member for Moreton once famously said, 'If a road doesn't have bitumen on it in the last seven years, why would you put that paving on it now?' That is the Labor attitude. I do thank him for giving me one minute on this. I just want to go straight to the mayor for

               , Kerry Hayes, a good man. He says the delays were 'just wrong', and he's right. It shows Labor's lack of understanding in Queensland and Labor's lack of care and empathy for the cattle industry and, particularly, for regional Australians.
