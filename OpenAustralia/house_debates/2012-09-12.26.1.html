        I would like to take this opportunity to speak in celebration of the life of Cec Clark, a local community leader who, sadly, passed away in August at the age of 87. Cec was an avid campaigner for the local community, having helped save the Beenleigh showgrounds from a proposed rail line. He founded the Beenleigh branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which he was involved with for some 23 years. He was on the committee which started the Meals on Wheels service in Beenleigh, which has been delivering meals for over 25 years. He was an avid fundraiser, raising valuable funds for the

        </a>
        of Queensland. He was also involved in the founding of Olivers Sports Complex. Cec will most certainly be remembered as a great contributor to our local community, and he will be dearly missed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also last month we mourned the death of the much loved Director of Performance Music at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_College" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Mrs Susan Gouchee, who, at the age of 49, lost her battle with cancer. She was best known for her outstanding work in music education and was the driving force behind the award-winning Cantabile Choir. Even as late as June this year, she accompanied the Cantabile members to Cincinnati, Ohio, where they competed in the 7th

        and came second. Susan is a great loss to the Canterbury College community and to her family and friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        May we remember both these wonderful members of our community very fondly.
