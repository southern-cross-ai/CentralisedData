        Narelle Ober has been a source of inspiration for me since the moment I first met her. Recently diagnosed with untreatable and aggressive cancer, sadly, Narelle passed away last weekend. I met Narelle in 2006, when she was one of the leading assistance advocates for drought-affected farmers—part of a group called Hands Across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . They sent thousands of bales of hay, special women's needs, clothing and scholarships for children to continue to attend school—myriad items to make the lives of our farmers better.

        Narelle always fought with passion and determination no matter what she did. Apart from that project, which lasted many years, I have a special connection with Narelle. I was born at Milton hospital and this has been the focus of Narelle's driving force, constantly raising money and funding for a range of new services and equipment for the Milton hospital. She had previously worked with a hospital auxiliary in Sydney, so quickly took a leadership role with the one in Milton, becoming the state's most successful in raising more money per capita of population than any other in rural New South Wales. During her time on the executive, this totalled more than $1 million to help build and equip the new renal and palliative care units, provide humidicribs for transporting infants and so many other pieces of equipment—it is a very long list. No-one ever said no to Narelle. In 2011, on
