        I would like to take the opportunity to encourage my constituents to shop local this Christmas. My electorate of Solomon has a large range of locally owned retailers that stock wonderful products, and we have a great range of locally owned services we can all utilise this festive season. In the lead-up to the busy Christmas period, it is important to visit local shops and small businesses when thinking about your Christmas presents and Christmas preparations. I understand that shopping small can sometimes be a little more expensive, but I like to think that, when you are shopping locally, you are giving back to your local community by supporting local jobs.

        , Australians will spend around $32.6 billion on Christmas. The power of shopping small or shopping locally has huge potential if we want to embrace it. If we all chose to divert just one per cent of that money into the more than two million small businesses in Australia, that would mean an extra $326 million into our local businesses. For every dollar we spend at a chain store, just 13.6 per cent is re-spent in the local economy. However, for every dollar spent at a local small business, 48 per cent is said to be re-spent locally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Imagine the money that could be pumped back into the communities of Darwin and Palmerston if we all chose to shop small this Christmas. If Australians can shop small to the point where one million local businesses can employ just one more staff member, that would be one million extra jobs.

        Darwin City, as you know, Madam Speaker, has a great range of locally owned retailers with excellent Christmas gift ideas. For example, we have Cameo Gifts and Homewares on Cavenagh Street, Embrace Boutique on Knuckey Street, Stomp Shoes on Knuckey Street, Elevated Boutique on Cavenagh Street, The Bookshop Darwin in the mall, Pink Hill Boutique in Knuckey Street, Splash on Knuckey Street, di CROCO in the mall and Elements Day Spa.

        A popular Christmas gift this year I am sure will be the

        , showcasing their most popular headlines and front pages. Who could forget front pages like 'Why I stuck a cracker up my clacker', 'Taxpayers fund bondage workshop', 'Horny rooster stalks woman' or 'Dog ate my G string'. I am sure this is going to be very popular. I went to purchase a couple of copies to share with my colleagues. Unfortunately, the books were sold out. But I do understand we can buy them online.

        Another favourite gift I have received in the past is from Territory photographer

        , why not do some Christmas shopping at the local surfwear shop, Beach Bums. Fannie Bay also has a great IGA, a fantastic butcher and an awesome Outback Bakery. If you are looking for gifts for the little ones, try Little Lamb in Casuarina, Little Rompers in Coconut Grove or the newly opened Milly, Molly and Mandy in Cullen Bay. I love to visit the local

       </p>
       <p>
        If people work around Winnellie, they can grab some groceries from the Winnellie Supermarket or order their Christmas ham from the Trader on Winnellie Road. Dimitrios Speciality Cakes on Eric Street in Alawa create amazing cakes, which would be a very impressive contribution to any Christmas party. But, if you live around Gray in Palmerston, my dad swears by the Gray supermarket schnitzel sandwich.

       <p>
        For your Christmas day seafood or takeaway chicken, consider the Chook Shed or Mr Barra in Tipperary Waters. Or you can try Parap Fine Foods for all your specialty food requirements for the festive season. This year, I encourage you to try and spend just one per cent of your Christmas budget at a small business near you and watch the benefits it will bring to our local area. Shop small this Christmas.
