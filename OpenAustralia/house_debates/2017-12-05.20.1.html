       <p>
        Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for looking after me. That cautionary warning is needed because, after the Moreton against Rankin community cricket cup—after Moreton was victorious in that match—I couldn't be prouder of the spirit in which the game was played and I couldn't be prouder of my teammates from the Rohingya community. I did miss Ali Kadri. I would note, for the member for Rankin's benefit, that the score of 105 was actually the first time that a three-figure score has ever been reached in the playing of this annual event. I could talk about the member for Rankin's outfielding—I hope that bruise on your hand heals soon; obviously we can work on your catching next year—but I do note I scored a four, and took a wicket as well. Member for Rankin, I can talk you through some of the finer points of the game down the track!
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank a few people: obviously, James Stedman for scoring; Murray, John and Muhammad from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Cricket" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for helping us out in the morning; St Laurence's for providing the field and putting it in tiptop condition. I look forward to the game next year. I particularly want to thank my teammates: Nurul Mustafa, Shafi Mohammed, Salim Mohammed, Rafique Mohammed, Ismail Mohammed, Afser Nurul,

        , Shafiki Alam, Yousuf Mohammed, Osman Gani, Ribatul Islam, Rezwan Mohammed, Alam Mohammed and Hakim Nurul. Good on you and well done. I look forward to coming back and winning it two years in a row next year.
