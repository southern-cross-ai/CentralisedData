        My question is to the minister for infrastructure. How will the Albanese Labor government clean up previous failures affecting the infrastructure investment pipeline and ensure that Australians can believe what the government says when it comes to major infrastructure projects?

             just say thank you very much to the member for Gilmore for the question. She knows just how important infrastructure investments are for our regions and for our cities. But, more importantly, she knows how important it is that when you promise to deliver infrastructure, it is actually delivered. That is why reforming the $120 billion infrastructure investment pipeline is so incredibly important. The previous government left this pipeline in a total mess, riddled with projects that were simply underfunded, had no funding partner, had not actually had proper cost-benefit analysis done and had not got the support of the states and territories. They were poorly scoped and were simply unable to be delivered. We saw the pipeline grow from 150 projects to 800 projects, a large number of which were under $50 million and simply could never be delivered.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the previous government somehow thought that they were going to deliver every single one of those 800 projects that were poorly funded, under scoped and not supported by the states and territories, then they had rocks in their heads. That is why we have had to look closely at this infrastructure investment pipeline. We want to make sure that if we promise a project, we actually deliver the project. That is what our regions deserve, it's what our rural communities deserve and it's what our cities absolutely deserve.

              <p>
               The growth in this infrastructure investment pipeline won't surprise anyone. Where was the major growth from 2016 to 2019? What was happening in that time? There were election campaigns on! That's the way in which those opposite used public money in infrastructure to invest in projects that suited their political purposes right the way across the country—so they could put out a press release. I've said before that you cannot drive on a press release!
              </p>
              <p>
               We are doing the hard work of cleaning up the mess that those opposite left an incredibly important part of this budget in. One hundred and twenty billion dollars has to be delivered through the infrastructure investment pipeline, and it can only be delivered if we look at every project. We will look at the cost of those projects and make sure that we can actually deliver them—that we have funding partners for them. We are cleaning up the mess that has been left by those opposite, to make sure that we can deliver infrastructure in our rural communities, in our regions and right the way across our thriving and growing suburbs.
