        I want to congratulate the

        premiership this year after a 32-year drought. It was a great performance by the

        , and I was pleased to be there on the day and celebrating with a friend of mine in the outer. I want to put on record my congratulations to the West Adelaide Football Club as a whole; their chief executive, John Kantilaftas; their president,

        a couple of times a year. It was great to see them getting a deserved result after coming close about a decade ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to congratulate the Woodville West-Torrens Football Club, another fine football club in my electorate, for reaching the grand final and having a very good season. Although West Adelaide came from ninth and obviously won the grand final, Woodville West-Torrens did very well as well. They had a very dominant year across the board and their reserves won the premiership, I think, and they had a great season overall. Good luck to them next year and well done on reaching the final. They were not the best team on the day—that is what the grand finals are all about—but I am sure they will be back next year and will continue the good work that the club does.
