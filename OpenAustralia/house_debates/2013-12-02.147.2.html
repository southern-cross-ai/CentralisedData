        I rise today to support this motion from the member for Higgins. As previous speakers are already noted, yesterday, 1 December 2013, was World
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        Day. It is important to restate some figures to remind us all just how widespread and dangerous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        -AIDS has become. This reminder is necessary because somehow the scale of AIDS no longer manages to shock us and no longer stirs our compassion as it should. We have become inured to the facts of AIDS. More than 35 million people now live with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and almost 10 per cent of these people are under the age of 15. Alarmingly, every day more than 6,000 people contract HIV.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our nearest neighbour,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        , is also fighting this deadly epidemic, and I am pleased Australian aid money assists them with this challenge. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge my colleagues from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        government. In 2011, the Kirby Institute estimated the number of people living with HIV in Papua New Guinea to be 34,000, which translates into an HIV prevalence rate of 900 per 100,000 people.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNAIDS" rel="nofollow">
         UNAIDS
        </a>
        's estimates for 2012 put the number of people living with HIV in PNG at 25,000. UNAIDS has also stated that in 2012 there were 13,000 children under the age of 17 left orphaned by AIDS in Papua New Guinea.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2011, I visited PNG with the then shadow foreign affairs minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Bishop
        </a>
        . During our time there, we met with representatives of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_Search" rel="nofollow">
         Oil Search
        </a>
        , including Managing Director Peter Botten and Mr Aopi. We saw firsthand some of the outreach work Oil Search is undertaking with local villages. Oil Search operates all of PNG's currently producing oil and gas fields and has a 29 per cent interest in the PNG
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        Project. Most importantly, the company has successfully developed public-private partnerships with PNG's national and provincial governments, non-governmental organisations and faith based organisations to improve HIV prevention and treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the Oil Search Health Foundation, which was established in 2011, the company has been able to secure grants from the global fund worth nearly $
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        80 million, and the company has also contributed more than $10 million of their own funds to tailor HIV programs to meet the specific needs of PNG people. Working closely with the PNG Department of Health, the Oil Search Health Foundation has aligned their HIV program and support services to the country's national standards and is now delivering health, education, treatment and support services where they are needed most. Today, a team of nearly 100 health foundation staff, most of whom are PNG nationals, deliver HIV, maternal and child-health and malaria programs in six of PNG's 22 provinces and support 55 health facilities that have performed over 36,000 HIV tests and distributed over 600,000 condoms since 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        On World Aids Day, oil search raises awareness about HIV by putting up big red ribbons at all its camps. Staff are also invited to participate in educational presentations. The Oil Search HIV program conducted its first HIV questionnaire last year for oil search's workforce in PNG. It showed a solid level of knowledge and understanding of HIV. The questionnaire was also repeated this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the services provided by the health foundation, since 2003 oil search's in-house medical team has also treated over 32,000 patients from its workforce and from communities in and around the areas in which it operates. Managing director Peter Botten says that these figures make oil search PNG's largest healthcare provider outside government. This is clear evidence of the enormous impact that businesses can have on people's lives, and I encourage more businesses to follow oil search's lead. In July 2014, Melbourne will host the 20th international AIDS conference. It will bring together 14,000 delegates from around 200 countries, making it the largest medical conference ever held in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The challenge of AIDS has not abated. The cost of care remains incredibly high, and the impact on those who have AIDS, their families and friends and the broader community make this a challenge that we must confront. I join with the member for Higgins in asking this parliament to continue Australia's strong commitment to an enduring and effective partnership between government, scientists and the community to meet the needs of people living with HIV, to continue Australia's strong commitment to medical health and research and to foster and cultivate Australia's medical health and research community and researchers to ensure that we stay at the forefront of all aspects of treatment, care and research in HIV. I commend the motion to the House.

         I am glad of the opportunity to speak in recognition of World
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
          AIDS
         </a>
         Day, and I thank the member for Higgins for bringing this motion. As the motion notes,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
          HIV
         </a>
         /AIDS has been responsible for the death of some 36 million people worldwide and, since the beginning of the epidemic, has affected more than 75 million people. While Australia's response to HIV/AIDS from the earliest days in the 1980s was forward-looking, proactive and effective, over the last few years there has been a worrying rise in the otherwise low rate of infection in this country, and this needs to be addressed as a public health priority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia contributes to the worldwide challenge of reducing HIV infection and treating those with AIDS both here and abroad. The motion acknowledges the significance of the 20th international AIDS conference, which will be hosted in Melbourne in 2014. This will be a crucial opportunity for the 14,000 delegates from around 200 countries to consider our position in relation to millennium development goal No. 6, which calls for unprecedented action to first halt and then reverse the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS. On that point, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNAIDS" rel="nofollow">
          UNAIDS

         <i>
          lobal report on the AIDS epidemic 2013
         </i>
         , released only last month, provides a sober reflection on progress made and challenges ahead. While we have achieved an estimated 33 per cent decrease in the number of annual new infections worldwide between 2001 and 2012 and a similar decrease in the number of deaths, there continue to be more than 35 million people infected by HIV. That includes 25,000 in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wholeheartedly support part 4 of the motion that calls on the parliament to continue efforts to support medical health research and to meet the needs of people living with HIV. But in my contribution to the debate I want to add how important it is for parliament to continue to support Australia's international contribution to combatting the global epidemic. The AIDS conference in Melbourne next year will certainly consider the domestic health efforts made by participating countries. But more importantly it will consider the global AIDS epidemic and the coordinated effort required to address the epidemic wherever it occurs. The fact is that through our aid program Australia plays an important role, especially in the region, in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. I take this opportunity to include within the debate on this motion a clear call on the government to sustain Australia's work and funding when it comes to the shared international effort required to defeat HIV/AIDS.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is salient to point out that the government has announced a $700 million cut to Australia's foreign aid budget in this financial year without providing details of how those cuts will be achieved. The cuts over the forward estimates amount to $4.5 billion. This year is nearly halfway done yet we still do not know where $700 million, or one out of every eight dollars of Australia's aid for this year, will be cut. I think it is unlikely that those cuts or the rest of the $4.5 billion to be slashed from our development assistance budget can be made across the range of bilateral, multilateral, regional and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         programs without withdrawing funding from health initiatives that are essential to saving lives from the scourge of HIV/AIDS.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will just mention a few of the existing commitments that we can only assume are now under question. First, there is the provision of up to $100 million over eight years, 2008 to 2015, to Indonesia for HIV prevention and care and the provision of $59 million over nine years, 2007 to 2015, for a regional program across Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines and China with a focus on harm reduction among people who inject drugs. And there is the provision of $30 million over five years, 2009 to 2013, for the Pacific Islands HIV and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STI" rel="nofollow">
          STI
         </a>
         Response Fund. If the government would make a commitment that no cuts will be made to programs that address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many people would be happy to hear it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the Labor government, in 2009 we launched a new international development strategy entitled Intensifying the Response: Halting the Spread of HIV. In October 2010 we announced a 55 per cent increase in our commitment to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Global Fund
         </a>
         to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. What the position is now, in terms of the Australian government approach, is unknown—because the new government has not made it clear where the $700 million in cuts to international assistance will be made this year, let alone the $4.5 billion in cuts over the four years to 2016-17.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the UNAIDS
         <i>
          Global report
         </i>
         notes, 'Our ability to lay the foundation for an end to the AIDS epidemic continues to be undermined by a major resource gap.' As we look forward to hosting the 20th
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Conference" rel="nofollow">
          International AIDS Conference
         </a>
         in Melbourne next year—the largest medical conference ever to be held in Australia—I look forward to hearing about how the government intends to maintain the absolutely critical growth path in Australia's contribution to the regional and global fight to defeat HIV/AIDS.
