       <p>
        Over the last week and a half, and I suppose the last year, what we have seen is a government which is suffering from a blue-collar revolt. We have seen a government that has completely forgotten about Tony's tradies, about blue-collar workers and about working-class communities. It has completely forgotten about the nation's vital industries, and we now find a government that is on the ropes. It has a jobs embassy out the front of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        members from the

        </i>
        and I share their cause with them. They were dragged off the ship in the middle of the night by security guards—off their place of work—so that their work would go elsewhere. It is a disgraceful and disgusting reflection of this government's attitude to maritime workers and seafarers.
       </p>
       <p>
        We see the same thing going on at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whyalla_Steelworks" rel="nofollow">
         Whyalla Steelworks
        </a>
        . We see the same contempt and the same attitudes at work there from this government. We had the member for Sturt bragging that he had saved Whyalla—that is what he told the Adelaide media last Wednesday night. But there was a delegation of Whyalla steelworkers in the House today, pleading for the government to do the right thing on procurement, contracts, antidumping and co-investment. They were led by Mr Eddie Hughes, the state member for Whyalla,

       </p>
       <p>
        We know that all of those workers did not come to Canberra because they love the place—they like making steel in the steel city—but they came here because they want to send this government a message about supporting blue-collar workers and blue-collar communities. It is about time the government listened; it is about time the government fulfilled its obligations as part of the member for Sturt's rhetoric to back in these blue-collar workers.

        We have also had another ship building delegation, led by

They are second to none in this country and around the world in their dedication to their work and in the skills they apply to that work. They should not be badmouthed by this government, which said that they could not build a canoe. They should not be badmouthed by the current Minister for Defence, who says that we do not have the capacity in this country to build ships. We do.

        What has happened is that this government has been exposed by, of all people, the Spanish press—

             The shipyards are emptying, the workers are being laid off. Those opposite can interject all they like, but they have to realise that you have to own your own work. You are the ones who sent the supply ships to Spain and so you should own it. We are going to make you bleed through the eyes for this decision—
