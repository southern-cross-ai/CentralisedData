       <p>
        It was my pleasure to welcome an official delegation from the City of Nanxiong People's Government last week at Kogarah within my electorate of Barton. The local area of Barton has a strong connection with those of a Chinese background. Approximately 18,000 residents of Chinese ancestry live in my electorate, contributing to the fields of business, manufacturing and trade. I am proud to have been mayor when Nanxiong City became a partner with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Kogarah" rel="nofollow">
         City of Kogarah
        </a>
        in 2010, as well as the significant moment in 2012 when Kogarah signed a memorandum of understanding with Nanxiong City. I was also privileged to be present within China in 2010 when we officially entered into our partnership. I hope to carry our relationship forward with me now as the member for Barton so that our national ties can be strengthened as well as our local ties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegates officially presented me, and Kogarah City councillors, with a book of 134 Cantonese surnames of people who participated in an ancient southward migration from Zhuji Lane within Nanxiong City. Many of those surnames are carried forward by Chinese residents in Barton today. These surnames represent a significant story of migration aimed at building a better life This is just one story, and point of origin, which those of Chinese ancestry in Barton share with those in China today, and it is these shared connections which bring us closer together as two partner cities. I am looking forward to the future of the relationship between Nanxiong City and Kogarah City, as well as the broader future of China and Australia in this Asian century. I appreciated the opportunity to reinforce this connection and I thank the delegates for their time with us and their Australian friends last week.
