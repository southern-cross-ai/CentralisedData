       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I introduce the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Bill 2021.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Electoral_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Electoral Act
        </a>
        1918 to strengthen the integrity of party registration by ensuring there exists a genuine base of community support for political parties and reduce the risk of voter confusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill responds to reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, known as JSCEM.
       </p>
       <p>
        P olitical party membership requirements
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill amends the Electoral Act to ensure that registered political parties are built on a genuine foundation of community support.
       </p>
       <p>
        It does this by increasing the minimum membership requirements for non-parliamentary parties from 500 members to 1,500 members.
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision will apply from the date of the royal assent for new political parties applying for registration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Non-parliamentary parties that are already registered will be provided three months from the date of the royal assent to demonstrate they have at least 1,500 members nationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also clarifies the existing requirement that an individual who is a member of more than one party can only be counted once for purposes of demonstrating a party's minimum membership requirements. This in no way precludes candidates contesting elections as independents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Political parties with same words in names or logos
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends the Electoral Act to minimise the risk that a voter may be confused, or potentially mislead, in the exercise of their choice at an election due to political parties being registered with very similar names.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment guards against this risk by requiring the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Electoral Commission
        </a>
        er to refuse an application to register a political party if a party name replicates a word in the name of an existing registered party.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will include commonly accepted variants of a word, and will also apply to the proposed abbreviation of the applicant party's name.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commonsense exceptions will apply:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Further, where an applicant provides written consent from an existing registered party with a similar name, the Electoral Commission will be able to accept the applicant party's name even if it contains the same words as the existing registered party.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         The Electoral Commission
        </a>
        may also refuse to register the logo of a political party on the grounds that it contains a word or abbreviation of an existing political party.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments are made to section 134A of the act to ensure consistent application to all existing registered parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Electoral Commission decisions in these matters will be reviewable by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Together, these provisions will enhance the integrity of the electoral process by reducing the likelihood of voters inadvertently associating or confusing political parties with similar-sounding names.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment responds to a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its
        <i>
         Report on the conduct of the 2019 federal election and matters related thereto
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
