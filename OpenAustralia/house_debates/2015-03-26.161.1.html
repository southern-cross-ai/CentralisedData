                  I did refer to him as the member for Deakin. I specifically said the member for Deakin. In 2014 we saw approximately 6,000 residents move into the area around Mernda and Doreen. It is a massive population migration from metropolitan Melbourne.

                  As we know, the growth of the Mernda and Doreen area has been continuing since its explosion nearly a decade ago. Initially they were well designed suburbs with three primary schools. There was also a town centre plan which was approved in 2007 and was to include community centres, libraries and many more facilities. Unfortunately, for the last four years has been a complete stop on any of the much needed infrastructure in our community. The fault lies solely on the shoulders of the former Liberal government. During their four years, not one cent of road spending was put into an area which has seen some 20,000 residents move in. Their ineptitude and inaction has left have left residents in Mernda in despair. Sadly, there are many families contemplating moving away because of the inaction of the Bailleau-Napthine failure.

                  As a result of the failure of the Bailleau-Napthine shambolic term in office, there is a backload of projects that are needed urgently. For instance, there is no secondary school or police station in the area and extremely limited transport options. There are not many recreation facilities throughout the community and we do not even have a town square. Luckily the Andrews government has swung into action and help is on its way. Last month,

                  announced the fast tracking of the Mernda Central p-12 school. Construction is due to commence at the end of the year and will open in the 2017 school year. It is going to make a huge difference to the lives of people in Mernda.

                  There is also the issue of the

                  </a>
                  . Labor's NBN plan, rolled out through Mernda and Doreen, was chugging along nicely until the Abbott government was elected and scrapped it. Many residents now live in areas where you can get NBN on one side of the street but not on the other because the now government tore up the plan and is delivering a second-class service to the people of Mernda and Doreen and in many other areas.

                  In the City of Whittlesea, the local council went out and invested time and money to put pipes into the ground ready for the rollout. But because the Abbott government has stopped the rollout of NBN, the council is now out there seeking an

                  to actually fill in and take up the charge because this government here in Canberra has ripped up NBN and at best is offering a second-class service. Even last week we saw the Minister for Communications finally admit that another promise was broken. They cannot and will not deliver the service that they promised the people of Victoria at the last election. They cannot do it and they are not going to do it.

                  Each and every day in this shambolic chaos of a government, we see backflip after backflip. There is not a promise they have taken to the last federal election that they have not broken. It is a sign of concern to residents of Mernda and Doreen, who want to get access to broadband for education, the business and for entertainment. They know that under this government it will not happen.
