        I rise to speak on an issue that is deeply important to both me and thousands in my community—the ongoing crisis in housing. My community is acutely aware of the issues of renting and buying homes. They've been living it for many years, whether they are in social housing, waiting for social housing, renting or first home buyers that have taken out a mortgage. They know all too well that the housing and rental markets are becoming increasingly difficult.
       </p>
       <p>
        Werriwa has suburbs that have seen fast-growing development over the past few years—suburbs such as Austral,

        and

        </a>
        . Established suburbs in Werriwa also feel the pressure from the rising cost of living and rental and mortgage stress—suburbs like Miller, Cartwright, Bonnyrigg and Sadleir. Recently, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings, Bonnyrigg was listed as having the second-highest percentage of borrowers who were behind on their mortgage. My community is experiencing all aspects of the housing crisis.
       </p>

        The Albanese government understands these pressures and is acting in a number of ways to address the issues.

        budget increased the amount of Commonwealth rent assistance, which will benefit almost 9,000 households in Werriwa. It also provided $2 billion for the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation's liability cap, which will support greater investment in public housing; an expansion of the Home Guarantee Scheme to help more Australians into their first home; and an additional $67.5 million to tackle homelessness through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement 2023-24.
       </p>
       <p>
        These budget measures were on top of the existing investment of $350 million to deliver 10,000 affordable rental homes over five years from 2024, through the National Housing Accord, and a widening of the remit of the national infrastructure facility, which will make up to $575 million available to invest in social and affordable rental homes. Last week the Prime Minister announced a further $2 billion for the Social Housing Accelerator, which will deliver thousands of new social housing homes throughout Australia. That funding will begin to roll out within the next two weeks. That's $2 billion that will go towards building new homes, renovating and refurbishing existing but uninhabited stock, and expanding programs. My home state of

        will receive $610 million. That is real funding going to where it is needed now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can't count how many times I've had people come to my office regarding the social housing waiting list. Waiting lists in my community stretch up to 20 years. For those already in social housing, there are growing concerns with the state of their homes, from mould to desperately needed repairs, with some housing stock over 60 years old. This funding boost will go a long way to improve the state of our social housing and help reduce an already record-high waiting list.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government understands the pressures that face Australians, but we don't pretend that there is nothing that can be done. We act. The Albanese government's investment in housing and homelessness stands at more than $9.5 billion this financial year. Unfortunately there is a roadblock that's preventing further investment into social and affordable housing. There are real people in communities around Australia who are waiting for relief and support. The government understands there is still a lot to do, and passing the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill would start that process.
       </p>

        So it has been distressing this week to see the political pointscoring that has seen the Greens political party again vote with the coalition because their demands have not been met—just so they can campaign. It is astonishing. The young woman who contacted my electorate office with three kids, who was escaping domestic violence and was on a long waiting list for housing, will be equally disappointed, through her tears.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        have not been supported by social housing advocates, homelessness service providers and housing industry groups, who have urged the passage of the bill. For every day that this bill is delayed past 1 July, that is $1.3 million a day not being spent in the social and affordable housing space. That's $250 million for every six-month delay. The government will continue to find practical solutions to help with the housing needs of Australia, with or without the Greens' support. We won't allow our community to be sacrificed by political pointscoring. We've had enough, and our community deserves better than this.
