       <p>
        Being a parliamentarian is an absolute honour and, I believe, the best job in the world—leading our communities in the Australian parliament. But this job is not the only way to lead. And by no means does leadership mean elitism. There are corporate leaders, political leaders, community leaders. But this is not what makes a leader. We can all be leaders, we can all be mentors, and we can all be role models. It is about leading in whatever drives your passion—in work, in our community, and in our families. It is about leading by example. It's about mentoring other women, and it's about not pulling up the ladder behind us.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing I feel more strongly about than mentorship when it comes to supporting women in their leadership potential and getting more women into leadership roles, for gender equality and women's economic empowerment. It takes those of us who are in a position to mentor to do it sincerely, passionately, and consistently. The reason I started a

        before coming into this place is that I felt that we weren't getting anywhere in this debate. We had stagnated. We had an opportunity to learn from the United States and they from us, and one of the best things I learned from that work was from a leading professor at

        , Iris Bohnet. Iris was a professional and an academic in behavioural science, and her research showed that, above all the diversity programs within organisations, the most success came through mentorship and supporting others, particularly when women were supporting other women into leadership positions, where mid-ranked and senior women and also men saw opportunities in their daily interactions to develop or grow junior colleagues. It is widely argued that mentorship plays a big role in changing an organisation's culture and is essential to long-term success.

       <p>
        My passion for getting more women into leadership positions has also led me to develop a Lindsay Women in Leadership Award, and I'll be announcing that award, along with a number of other leadership awards across Lindsay. The award will recognise a woman who positively contributes and demonstrates leadership in our community and in their chosen field. This is one way we can acknowledge, applaud and promote the efforts of women right across Lindsay who are making a difference, setting an example, mentoring other women, and leading the way. Another award that I will be announcing is an 'Aussie Made' award. Lindsay is a great place to live, work and stay, and our local businesses are vital to what makes our community so great. I'm passionate about Australian manufacturing and I'm proud of the manufacturers in Lindsay creating and supporting local jobs, contributing to our economy and making high-quality Aussie-made products. That's why, in recognising an outstanding local manufacturer, I'm announcing the Lindsay Aussie Made Business Award. We have an incredible manufacturing industry, from rail parts to keep our trains safe and moving across our country to advanced electronics in our Army's vehicle communications systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        I often say that Lindsay is full to the brim and overflowing with community spirit. This has shone through in our community and has helped us band together, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Service is a hallmark of our community spirit, so the Lindsay Community Service Award will recognise a selfless, honest, compassionate, hardworking person making a positive impact on those around them. As we look to the future, from inspiring our future leaders to making sure our kids have the skills they need to take on the jobs of the future, education is key. That's why I'm also announcing the Lindsay Educator of the Year Award, recognising a local educator for their contribution to our community. The coronavirus pandemic has put our community's health in the spotlight, particularly the incredible efforts of our frontline health workers, so I'm announcing a Lindsay Healthy Active Living Award to recognise someone who is making a positive contribution to the health of our community through their leadership in this field.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage our community to think about people who are able to apply for these awards—incredible people making an impact on you and showing leadership in our community. I look forward to the applications coming through my office soon.
