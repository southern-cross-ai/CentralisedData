        , raised four kids and welcomed six grandchildren. Ray was a hard-working railway worker during his time. He always advocated for improved safety and working conditions. When he retired he was a volunteer with the Mount Druitt Senior Citizens Welfare Association, where I got to meet him. For over a quarter of a century he served as their president and secretary or was connected with the association in some way. He took great pride in being the instigator of a club which had close to 200 members and which was open five days a week and offered a wide variety of activities. I can recall on many occasions when Ray was kind enough to let us use the rooms for an annual seniors forum, where hundreds of people would be in attendance. Ray and Claire were jointly recognised in 2006 as Blacktown senior citizens of the year.

        Ray's work didn't stop with the senior citizens association. He received countless awards and assisted with many activities and events for
