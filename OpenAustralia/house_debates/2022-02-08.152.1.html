       <p>
        I rise today to implore the government to get a move on and immediately roll out funding under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">
         Black Summer
        </a>
        Bushfire Recovery Grants Program. It's been two years since the Black Summer bushfires wreaked havoc on communities across my electorate. Since then this government has made multiple announcements, committing funding to supporting bushfire affected communities. I can honestly say that I welcome those announcements. I welcome any funding and any commitment from government to support these communities, because I know how much this support is needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem is that this government is really good at making the announcements—they're experts at standing in front of the camera and making promises—but this government has not been good at the follow-through. One of the big announcements this government shouted from the rooftops in April last year was the Black Summer Bushfire Recovery Grants Program; $280 million in funding was made available to communities still recovering from the 2019-20 bushfires. Following this announcement I met with countless community groups to discuss the funding and possible projects and to encourage organisations to apply. Our communities know what they need, so I was happy to listen and advocate on their behalf. Successful projects under this fund were originally expected to be announced in November or December last year. Because of this published time line, community groups applied for funding for time-sensitive projects that started early this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        These competitive grant processes are not easy. They are complicated and stressful, and volunteers spent hours compiling documents and pulling together comprehensive grant applications. But the government, whilst eager to make an announcement, didn't prioritise the delivery. We're now in February, and Eden-Monaro community groups, businesses and councils are still in the dark about whether they'll receive any of this much-needed assistance. Projects that were going to start this month are being delayed or cancelled because community groups don't know whether funding will come. All the while, individuals and communities are still struggling to get back on their feet after the fires. The fact is that the Morrison-Joyce government should have done everything in its power to avoid delays. Instead, my communities have been left waiting for two months, with no reason and no explanation. This has caused unnecessary stress and uncertainty. We're two years on from the Black Summer bushfires. The money has been allocated, and, quite frankly, the government needs to get a move on and make sure this money flows.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that this government likes to throw around money during an election campaign. It is my sincere hope that this is not what has caused the delay with the Black Summer Bushfire Recovery Grants Program, because to even consider delaying bushfire support for political sway is deplorable. Stop the delays, stop the frustration and get on with it, because the truth is that I am sick of having to stand here and call on the government to do more. Supporting bushfire affected communities is a no-brainer, and two years on communities shouldn't still be waiting in the dark.
       </p>
       <p>
        In times of crisis, communities band together in recovery. Unfortunately, almost immediately after the Black Summer bushfires were over, the pandemic hit and our communities were forced apart. Restrictions meant important community events and social activities were cancelled, including agricultural shows. But, after a two-year hiatus, countries shows are back, and I was thrilled to attend and speak at the Candelo Show recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agricultural shows are the heart of so many rural communities. They're an integral part of our community identity, and it is wonderful that these shows are back, across my electorate. It's at ag shows that you can witness firsthand the intrinsic value of community that is still so strong in towns and villages across Eden-Monaro. Of course our ag shows have all the traditional activities such as woodchopping, dog jumping, horse programs and baking competitions. When you attend these shows, what becomes obvious is that the backbone of the agricultural shows are the volunteers that make them happen and the personal connections made.
       </p>
       <p>
        After two years it's so special to see people catching up while celebrating something that means so much to them. These catch-ups and connections are so valuable to people in regional and rural areas like mine. On top of demonstrating the best of our agricultural industry and community, ag shows like those in Candelo and Nimmitabel are an important way for people in other parts of our region to get an understanding of the job our farmers do. They're also a fantastic opportunity for children to get up close to farm animals and learn about the role in supplying produce across the state and country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I give a big shout-out to all of our volunteers who have worked tirelessly for months to get these shows back up and running. It's a huge effort to coordinate and organise these wonderful shows, and I know so many people in our local communities are very thankful. Unfortunately, it is not possible for me to get to every ag show across Eden-Monaro, as much as I'd love to. While I'll get to the ones that I can, I encourage everyone else to get out there and support your local shows. The Candelo, Eurobodalla and Nimmitabel shows were all fantastic family-friendly events, and the Cobargo show is on this weekend. I know how excited this community is for the show to be back. If you're on the coast, please head into Cobargo and check out the show. If you live in the Snowy Monaro, Queanbeyan-Palerang,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yass_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yass Valley
        </a>
        or Snowy Valleys, and Cobargo is too far to travel, don't worry; there are plenty of other shows coming up that will no doubt showcase the best of our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I won't sing the tired old song '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I've_Been_Everywhere" rel="nofollow">
         I've Been Everywhere
        </a>
        ', but, over the next two months, the shows that are coming up include Bega, Braidwood, Delegate, Tumut, Dalgety, Cooma, Adelong, Bemboka, Bombala, Tumbarumba, Yass and Batlow. Odds are, if you've got a free weekend over the next two months, there's a country show in the region that you can attend. So, please, get out there, take your family, enjoy the entertainment on offer and support our country shows.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, before I wrap up, I'd like to keep the positivity going and talk about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        honours list, to reflect on the contributions and achievements of some local residents. Across Eden-Monaro we have an extraordinary number of volunteers who dedicate huge amounts of time to giving back to their community. Almost every town and village across Eden-Monaro took the opportunity on Australia Day to recognise and thank community members who have gone above and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased to attend Australia Day ceremonies in Yass, Cooma and Queanbeyan, where I was able to congratulate Barry O'Mara, Helen Drayton and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Butler" rel="nofollow">
         Christine Butler
        </a>
        for being named citizens of the year in their respective communities. Congratulations also to Snowy Valley Citizen of the Year, Raymond (Dossie) Carr and Bega Valley Citizen of the Year John Cullen. But they weren't the only ones to receive this honour. All across Eden-Monaro, individuals and groups were recognised. To everyone who received an honour or award, please accept my sincere congratulations. Our communities wouldn't be the same without the efforts of these incredible people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across Eden-Monaro, dozens of new Australians also took the citizenship pledge on Australia Day. To all of our new Australians: I'm thrilled that you've chosen our country as your new home. Please accept my heartfelt welcome. We are so happy to have you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I sit down, I want to give a shout-out to the Eden-Monaro residents who were recognised in the Governor-General's Australia Day honours list: Andrew Colvin of Sutton, who has been appointed an
