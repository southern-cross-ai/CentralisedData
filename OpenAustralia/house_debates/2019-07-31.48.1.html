        A lot has changed since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Hyperdome" rel="nofollow">
         Logan Hyperdome
        </a>
        shopping centre first opened its doors 30 years ago. There were a water park and a zoo at the present site and, sadly, I had a lot more hair. The centre was opened by then National Party Premier Mike Ahern, and I can remember that back then the locals, including me, were amazed at the state-of-the-art centre. Back then, there were statues from Expo 88 throughout the centre. There were even a rock pool and a large water feature. I have many fond memories of the circus theme there and the old playground opposite the food court. My kids were quite unimpressed when they took it away. I am sure many people in Logan would have vivid memories of the Hyperdome, and it is encouraging to see that the centre is still open for business today. On opening day 144 retailers lined the central hallway, and many of the original shops still call the centre home today, including Sizzler, Prouds, Stefan and Coles. It now features over 220 retailers and continues to enjoy strong trade and support from the local community. To celebrate this milestone the centre will reward 30 locals nominated for their community work and feature an in-house exhibition showcasing their stories and contribution to Logan. I look forward to coming back to the community and celebrating this great anniversary and enjoying a slice of the famous cheese toast at Sizzlers.
