        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. How is the Albanese Labor government investing in defence to keep all Australians safe? What does this mean for

          The defence minister will pause. We are 10 seconds into an answer. The minister for Casey has been

          all week. He is going to leave the chamber under 94(a). It is completely unacceptable to start yelling within seconds of when a minister has just begun. It is highly disorderly and highly respectful.

           At the Osborne Naval Shipyard in Adelaide, at full production, there'll be 4,000 to 5,000 people building our future submarines. In combination with those building our future frigates, the Osborne Naval Shipyard will be home to 7,000 highly skilled workers. To enable this, the government is investing in a skills academy, which will be situated at Osborne, and modelled very much on the training academy of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">

           , at its facility at Barrow-in-Furness.

            ASC
           </a>
           is standing up a workforce of 500 people to sustain submarines as part of the Submarine Rotational Force West, and that is happening right now. There are employees of ASC on their way to Hawaii to gain valuable experience. Indeed, by next year we will see a target of a hundred employees of ASC working and gaining experience at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" rel="nofollow">
            Pearl Harbor
           </a>
           . That is in addition to 1,200 people that will be needed at the future Henderson naval precinct to build Navy's future platforms, including our general-purpose frigate. To see that happen, we're working closely with South Metropolitan

           But to do this requires resources, which is why the government is increasing defence spending to 2.4 per cent of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           . Those opposite have been repeatedly asked about defence spending and they have stubbornly refused to answer that question, which leaves them where they were at the last election, which is a spend of 2.1 per cent of GDP over the same period. But the issue is that 2.1 per cent will not build our frigates; 2.1 per cent will not manufacture long-range missiles; 2.1 per cent will not deliver us an amphibious army; and 2.1 per cent will not give us A

            US
           </a>
           . Those opposite stand for cuts to defence spending and, with it, they stand for cuts to jobs in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           and in Western Australia, the shadow minister's own electorate. But, much worse than that, those opposite now stand for compromising Australia's national security. The Albanese government is committed to increasing defence spending, to deliver our future submarines to keep Australians safe.
