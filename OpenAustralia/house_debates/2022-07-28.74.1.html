         I thank the member for Lingiari for her question and congratulate her on her very powerful speech last night. And I want people in this chamber to note that history is being made right now with the member for Lingiari asking me this question. History is calling us all. The Australian government is committed, as the Prime Minister just said, to implementing the Uluru statement in full. We will hold a referendum to enshrine a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         Voice in the Constitution this term of parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         The oldest continuous cultures in the worldâ€”something that is a gift to all of us. Despite inhabiting this land for more than 60,000 years, we have no place in the founding legal document. It is a glaring omission. This is not a radical proposal; it is fair and it is practical. It is about growing our nation up together. It's about unity. It's about hope. It's about consulting, as the Prime Minister has just said, Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people about laws and policies that affect us, and it is about delivering practical outcomes. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create lasting change. It is one shot in the locker. Every Australian will have the chance to answer the Uluru statement's patience call, and I invite them to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Uluru was five years ago. Since then there has been consideration by constitutional experts, First Nations leaders and parliamentary committees. I believe Australians are ready to take the next step. I want to acknowledge the shadow minister and his really good will and involvement in the discussions that we have had. I am encouraged by the in-principle support of all the state and territory leaders, including Premier Perrottet from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Premier Rockliff from Tasmania. I invite all the members of this place to join us on this journey.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an issue that does not belong to either side of politics. It is about building a better future. History is calling us. Australians believe in decency, and I say to those on the other side: get onto the station; we want you to be on the train with us.
