        The Australian government extends its deepest condolences to those people who have lost family or friends on Germanwings flight 4U9525 that crashed overnight in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Alps" rel="nofollow">
         French Alps
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, French authorities have confirmed that none of the 150 people on board have survived. Two Australians, Carol Friday and her son Greig Friday, residents of Victoria, were on board the flight. Consular officials have been in contact with the Friday family and are providing all possible consular assistance. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this unimaginably difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The family are issuing a statement, at this moment, through the

        and have asked me to read part of it to the parliament:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our family is in deep disbelief and crippled with sadness and would like to ask for privacy. Carol was a loving Mother of two, a devoted wife to her husband Dave and a sister to three brothers. She celebrated her 68th birthday on March 23rd.

        Greig was to turn 30 on 23rd April. He was a loving son to Carol and Dave and an exceptional brother to his sister Alex. He was adored by all of his family and friends.

       <p class="italic">

        Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay—

        We are checking passenger information to determine whether any other Australian citizens, dual national or permanent residents may have been on board.

        recovery operation is underway, but it will be a challenging task given the remote location seven kilometres from the nearest road and at 1,600 metres altitude. They are currently deploying over 600 gendarmes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our consular officials will set up a mobile office nearby where they will liaise with French authorities on the recovery effort. It is premature to speculate on what may have caused this terrible incident. Relevant authorities will undertake a thorough investigation. The parent company, Lufthansa, is working on the assumption of an accident, while French Prime Minister Valls has said that no hypothesis can be ruled out. When the black box is analysed this will hopefully provide more answers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will, of course, assist in any way possible.

        <p>
         We are all deeply saddened at this terrible news of this tragic loss of so many lives. Australians are great travellers and we have to be because of our distance from the rest of the world. And so, air disasters very often touch our nation, even when they occur in the other side of the world. So it is with this case, with the distressing news that two Australians, Carol Friday and her son Greig Friday from Victoria, were on-board Germanwings flight 9525.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have all farewelled friends and family on their way to a holiday overseas confidently expecting them to return safely with stories of their adventures. All of us, and all Australians, feel deep sympathy for the family of these two citizens who we are now mourning after such a senseless and tragic loss. Across Europe there are other families, including the parents of the students from Joseph-Koenig Gymnasium returning from a school exchange, who are also experiencing this devastating grief and loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that the conditions around the crash site are making the work of recovery and investigation very difficult. We thank the government of France, emergency workers and officials for their efforts. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of all of those on board, as well as the people of Germany, Spain and France.
