          I congratulate Dr Gillespie, the member for Lyne, for a lifetime of service to medicine and patients in his local community. He is very keen to see additional health services delivered into the electorate of Lyne, but, of course, it is made more difficult because Labor wasted billions of dollars. They set up what they claimed at the time to be the signature health policy of the Rudd-Gillard years—the so-called
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
           GP
          </a>
          superclinics. That saw $650 million of borrowed money going into a program, including this one at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
           Port Macquarie
          </a>
          , but the problem is that not many patients have been seen.
         </p>
         <p>
          I thought we were running out of examples of the success of the GP superclinic, but this one at Port Macquarie is pretty special. It is pretty special because the taxpayers of Australia have paid $5.6 million to this particular superclinic in Port Macquarie that was promised in 2010, but not a single patient has been seen at this clinic. So people rightly had an expectation that, when the Labor Party promised that a clinic would be set up, doctors would actually be employed and that patients would be seen.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not think it gets much more basic than that.

             People who build a house pay progress payments to the builder and pay a payment on completion. The problem is that Labor gave all of the money up-front. They devised some great schemes. As we know, the member for Sydney—who is now looking through press clips and all sorts of other issues but not concentrating on this area—after the success of the superclinic program, moved on to the housing affordability scheme that put money into housing that ended up sinking into the earth.

                 I welcome that interjection from the member for Ballarat, because, let me assure you, these promises from Labor have been coming since 2007. The original proposal from Labor was that these superclinics would be set up and that people would be diverted away from emergency departments, but quickly they retreated from that statement because there has not been one shred of evidence in the last six years that any patient has been diverted away from an emergency department. At the same time, the Labor Party created 12 great, big, new health bureaucracies in Canberra. There are now 21 bureaucracies in addition to the department of health—and we do not run a single hospital. We do not employ a doctor, a nurse or a pharmacist that sees a patient. Yet, Labor diverted money away from these communities into these bureaucracies in Canberra. It is an absolute disgrace. I can tell you one thing: this government will not make the same mistakes that Labor did. We will put money back to frontline services and we will clean up Labor's mess in health.
