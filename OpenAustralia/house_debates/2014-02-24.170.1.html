        I would like to congratulate Yasmin Catley on her preselection to be the Labor Party candidate in the state election in the seat of Swansea. Yasmin is an outstanding woman who has many, many attributes. She is the kind of person who is an actual doer as opposed to the current member for Swansea. She has children who range from primary school age to high school, and she is really aware of the issues that are important to families. She knows how important it is that there are good services in our local hospitals and that kids get great education, and she knows how important jobs are for the people of the Swansea area. She is also very active in local community groups and sporting groups. Her children play netball for

        and they play every Saturday in Belmont. Yasmin will be an outstanding member of parliament. I am sure the current member for Swansea—Liberal member
