        An ironman triathlon is rightly considered to be one of the world's most challenging and physically demanding events. The pinnacle of the international series is the

        in Hawaii. Qualifying for the world championship is no small feat, let alone competing, but that's just what one of my constituents has achieved. Nathan Parker, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berowra_Heights" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , conquered the course in October, and equally impressive is the road he took to get there. Balancing both his fitness and his family commitments, Nathan began competing in ironman events in 2007. In his decade-long journey to qualify, Nathan battled three stress fractures in his pelvis, a torn muscle and recurrent plantar fasciitis. With the support and blessing of his wife, Tracey, Nathan missed his children's netball finals and soccer gala days in pursuit of a goal. His efforts were rewarded when he won his age division at the

        </a>
        half ironman event in May, and just over a month later he placed third in the Asia-Pacific championships and secured his spot in Hawaii. In preparation for the big day, Nathan turned to his community to train. He cycled the Old Pacific Highway each weekend and ran through the Berowra valley with the Berowra Bush Runners club.

        After a decade of sacrifice and dedication, in October Nathan completed the gruelling Hawaii course in a time of nine hours, 35 minutes and 54 seconds, coming an impressive 16th in the 40- to 44-year-old category. Every morning alarm, every social commitment sacrificed and every pain barrier broken was rewarded by such a remarkable effort. Congratulations, Nathan Parker, on your outstanding achievement.
