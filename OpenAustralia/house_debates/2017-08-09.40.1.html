        —invictus is Latin for unconquered—is the international sporting event for wounded and injured servicemen and women. The 2017 Invictus Games are being held in Canada next month, and I am very proud to inform the House that there are three members of my community representing our country. Twenty-one year old Lismore man Nathan Parker was a trainee pilot with the

        when he lost his arm after a bus carrying 50 academy personnel rolled over, injuring 30. Nathan had a prosthetic arm fitted last year. Nathan set himself two goals: to fly again and to represent his country in the Invictus Games.

He has numerous musculoskeletal injuries and, like many returned servicemen and women, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. He says his greatest achievement in life so far was recognising he needed help to manage his
