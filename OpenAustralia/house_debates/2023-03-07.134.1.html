        LING () (): Darwin is Australia's Fleet Base North, and it is increasing in value to Australia's defence as our strategic circumstances worsen. As the ADF goes on a footing of what Minister for Defence Richard Marles calls 'impactful projection', long-range strike capability is going to be a key part of the equation for keeping any adversaries at bay, and, with our F-111s retired now, AUK

        submarines will be the key to boosting Australia's power projection into our Indo-Pacific region. Rotating nuclear-powered submarines through Darwin could prove tactically decisive in our ability to deter or defeat a long-range threat. As a 2011 Defence department report concluded, 'Darwin, as a forward operating base for future submarine operations, will enhance future submarine capabilities.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Rotating through Darwin also gives our conventional Collins class submarines 10 days extra fuel and that much more range into the Indo-Pacific. Additionally, Darwin has the logistical, airport and housing infrastructure to sustain a skilled local workforce to perform light maintenance on civilian and ADF vessels. And we are closer than ever to this goal. Just this week, the

        Just this week the Northern Territory government awarded a design consultancy contract to Wallbridge Gilbert Aztec for the building of the $515 million Darwin ship lift. It will be the largest facility of its kind in northern Australia. Currently ships must travel to Queensland or

        for maintenance. It's a long way. Not only is this ineffective but also it is costly in terms of time, fuel and wages. The ship lift at East Arm will bring millions into the

        While at the Avalon air show last week I discussed some of these matters with US Navy Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Sam Paparo. I also met with former defence minister and former ambassador
