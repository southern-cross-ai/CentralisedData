       <p>
        Today I rise to speak on renewable energy—a matter I also raised in the Main Committee earlier today, where I discussed the Howard government’s programs and policies that have directly supported or generated investment in renewables in excess of $3½ billion. In contrast to the member for Werriwa, I clearly remember the 17 per cent interest rates, the record bankruptcies and double-digit unemployment of the 1990s. The member for Werriwa mentioned job security and financial security. We have never been in a better time in Australia’s history as far as economic prosperity is concerned.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to continue with the theme of renewable energy in my home state of Tasmania. I particularly wish to acknowledge a company called Roaring 40s, which was established in 2005 as a joint venture between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydro_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         Hydro Tasmania
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLP" rel="nofollow">
         CLP
        </a>
        Power Asia Limited. Roaring 40s not only operates the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolnorth_Wind_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Woolnorth Wind Farm
        </a>
        in Tasmania’s far north-west but also is involved in some of the great work and industries that they are creating in China.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opportunities exist in the renewable energy sector not only in connection with construction and the creation of clean, green energy; there is also considerable potential for maintenance services to the existing wind turbines both here in Australia and overseas. For example, Australia currently has 542 wind turbines. Another 119 are under construction and an additional 426 have been approved for construction. Approximately another 220 are expected to be built in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , and others have been proposed in Victoria. The current estimated market value for wind turbine maintenance and service in Australia is $10 million. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        has forecast that this amount is likely to increase to approximately $100 million by the year 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also substantial overseas maintenance and service opportunities, including in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        market, which is growing significantly due to New Zealand’s high renewable energy target. The growth of the maintenance market in New Zealand is expected to reach some $130 million by 2016. The value of wind turbine establishments in Asia is predicted to increase substantially over the next decade, adding to this opportunity. Major wind energy projects are underway in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. Taiwan is expecting its demand for wind turbine components to grow from $
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        80 million to $US 550 million by 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        North West Tasmania provides an exciting opportunity for developing industrial centres of excellence as well as offering the development of strategic supply chain and servicing alliances. The region offers considerable potential in the provision of professional services in designing and developing new technologies for wind turbine components and renewable energy equipment which is currently being exported overseas. In addition, associated export facilities provide the region with significant investment opportunities across a range of high-end manufacturing, technology and related service sectors. For example, as part of developing a high-end industrial cluster, a family-owned Tasmanian company, Aus-Tech Composites Pty Ltd—which was established in August 2002 to supply a growing Australian wind turbine market—is the first and only company to manufacture wind components in Australia. Aus-Tech Composites supplied Vestas, the world’s leading wind turbine manufacturer, with composite components including nacelle covers, nose cone, and spinner sets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Braddon has a ready-made skilled labour supply which is experienced in many facets of wind energy and related manufacturing. There are substantial opportunities to foster linkages and to broker both skill and intellectual capital partnerships with local employers, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        , and the local campuses of the University of Tasmania and the North West Tasmania Australian Technical College. It is so important that they work together to achieve the best not only for industry but also for education.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe wind energy has the potential to be a key element of the Howard government’s long-term strategy for cleaner energy. I will continue to strongly encourage the government to continue to support research and investment in this field—not only as part of its ongoing development of a practical suite of renewable technologies but also to ensure Australia’s energy security, to lower Australia’s emissions and to safeguard Australian jobs. I am committed to doing all that I can to further technological and manufacturing opportunities related to the wind energy sector, especially in North West Tasmania and associated areas that have the potential for wind energy.
