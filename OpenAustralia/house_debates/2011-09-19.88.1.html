        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister outline for the House modelling on how the government's plan to put a price on carbon pollution will affect public transport? What is the government doing to assist commuters to have greater access to public transport?

         I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and indeed for her ongoing commitment and support for public transport, particularly for people in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         . This is a government that has committed more for urban public transport than was committed by all governments between Federation and 2007. Part of that commitment, of course, was to the Parramatta-Epping rail link, which the state government, in their budget a few weeks ago, walked away from. They walked away from that commitment in spite of the fact that it had some support from over there, sometimes, but consistent support from all those on this side of the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the member for Parramatta would know that the government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         also walked away from the $4 billion of state funding which had been committed for the Western Express line. That would have been of great benefit for all residents west of Parramatta on that line.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are committed to public transport as part of our commitment to dealing with climate change. One of the benefits of increased use of public transport is that it lowers our carbon footprint by lowering our emissions. So this is a vital economic reform but is also vital for our environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am asked about what modelling has been done. Of course, the government is ensuring that for any increased prices there is full and proper assistance given. Indeed, greater assistance will be given than the cost. Treasury modelling shows that there will be a modest impact of some 0.5 per cent on public transport.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to provide assistance nine out of every 10 households will receive assistance in the form of tax cuts or higher payments and there will also be direct assistance in terms of increased pensions and increased assistance for those on benefits. Compare that with the impact of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         . The impact on public transport fares was some eight per cent—that is, eight per cent under the GST; 0.5 per cent under the carbon pricing. This carbon pricing relates to just a few cents on the ticket price for most public transport services. For example, a ticket from Parramatta to Central would have an increase of 2c or 3c.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about modelling that has been done. I was very surprised to see an exaggerated claim in the

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you made it very clear in the last sitting week, last Wednesday, that these kinds of attacks on state Liberal governments or the opposition would not be regarded as relevant or in order. I would ask you to draw the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport back to your ruling from last Wednesday.

           <p>
            I am very clearly about the modelling for the price impact. What the email of 14 July said was this: 'Juicy quotes from the department of transport's brief. Note that there are some not so helpful quotes in the brief too.' You bet there were. What the department of transport's brief said was, 'The introduction of the carbon tax is not expected to have any measurable effect in people's choice regarding public transport or private car use.'
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
             NSW
            </a>
            Treasury found, 'The impact, in terms of price impact, was 0.49 per cent,' exactly what our federal Treasury modelling showed, and that the impact would be miniscule. It is important in the debate about our clean energy future that people stick to the facts, not to making up figures.
