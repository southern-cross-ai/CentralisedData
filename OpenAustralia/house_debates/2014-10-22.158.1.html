        I rise today to commend the work of secondary schools in Hindmarsh, as hundreds of year 12 students prepare for their final exams in the coming week. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work of school teachers, parents, students and the school community generally. I congratulate all the year 12 students in Hindmarsh on their 13 years of education and wish them the best of luck.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hindmarsh is home to a large number of talented students, and today I want to acknowledge students from

        After the award ceremony, over the morning tea, I enjoyed talking to a number of the college community, including the chair of the school board, parents and students, as well as school captains Hannah Schwarz and Michael Ucci. Congratulations to both Hannah and Michael on their speeches in the award ceremony as well as their awards and achievements during their years at St Michael's.
       </p>
       <p>
        Awards presented during the ceremony ranged from academic excellence to sporting achievements, and from school service and commitment to all-round recognition. I was very impressed with the achievements of all the award winners as they were read out during the ceremony, and I take this opportunity to congratulate the following high achievers: Lucy Tweed,

        I would also like to make a special mention of Ella Kearsley, who was the inaugural recipient of the Hindmarsh Shield Award. The Hindmarsh Shield Award is presented in the spirit of Sir John Hindmarsh whom the electorate was named after and who was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Governor of South Australia
        </a>
        from 1836 to 1838. The award acknowledges the valuable contribution of a student, recognising excellence with leadership, community service, sporting or the musical domain. When presented with her award it was very clear that Ella was a very worthy winner. Throughout her time at St Michael's Ella had shown a positive contribution to the school and to the local community. With a strong sense of community Ella was at the front line when volunteers were called on, rising to any challenge. Ella has a no-fuss attitude and is always willing to lend a hand, whenever and wherever required, and it a strong and solid work ethic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I enjoyed talking to Ella's family afterwards, and it was lovely to learn that her family had arranged for her grandmother to make a special visit to Adelaide to attend the ceremony. It was great also to hear that Ella's brother had previously received the
