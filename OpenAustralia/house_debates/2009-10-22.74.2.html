       <p>
        On indulgence: it is my sad task to inform the House of the passing away of the American born but very popular Australian entertainer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Lane" rel="nofollow">
         Don Lane
        </a>
        , who has died from a dementia related illness aged 75. Many of us in this House and many listening will know Don Lane for his work on the
        <i>
         Don Lane Show
        </i>
        . It debuted on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network" rel="nofollow">
         Nine Network
        </a>
        in 1975 and ran for almost a decade. Over what was a very extensive career, he won some 15 Logie awards, and in 2003 he was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. Lane was diagnosed with dementia in 2005. I think that he has been living in a care facility since reports surfaced that he was suffering from dementia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Interestingly, Don Lane began his working life as a nightclub performer and singer. He briefly appeared on one episode of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan_Show" rel="nofollow">
          Ed Sullivan Show
         </a>
        </i>
        in the late 1950s as one half of a double act. In Australia in the sixties he was involved in a number of different television programs, but it was the
        <i>
         Don Lane Show
        </i>
        on the Nine Network that made him a household name around Australia. On behalf of the government, I pass on to his family, friends and colleagues our sympathies for this tragic loss.

        <p>
         On indulgence, on behalf of the coalition, we would like to associate ourselves with the remarks of the minister on the passing of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Lane" rel="nofollow">
          Don Lane
         </a>
         . He is certainly, although not a native-born Australian, someone who made a very marked impact on Australian cultural life. Many millions of Australians would recognise the amazing contribution he made. Having been born in New York City to a Catholic mother and a Jewish father, he certainly grew up with a lifestyle and in a family that was, although not unique, perhaps interesting coming into Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         His early work as a nightclub performer and a singer, doing a mix of comedy and singing, certainly boded well for his subsequent years on the
         <i>
          Don Lane Show
         </i>
         . Of course, he worked very closely with a number of famous Australians, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Newton" rel="nofollow">
          Bert Newton
         </a>
         . The various national Logie awards that he received—including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Logie" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Logie
         </a>
         ; Most Popular Male Personality; Most Popular Male, in Victoria; and Most Popular Show—were all a testament to his fine contribution to Australian culture. He will certainly be missed.
