       <p>
        Last Friday night, I attended the St George Art Society's annual art show. We have many talented artists in the St George region, and indeed in my electorate of Banks. It was terrific to attend the annual show. The society was formed back in 1944, and for 71 years the annual arts show has been held. If we reflect on all the things that have changed in our world in that time, it is somewhat comforting to think that the St George art show has been on every single year.

        Jean Harrow, who is the president of the art society, does a fantastic job, and there were scores of paintings there on the evening. There were seven different categories of awards. One of the awards that I presented was the Wal Chandler Award for traditional paintings in oil or acrylic; I also presented the overall Award for Excellence. It was sad that Mitzi Tilley was not present that evening, although many of her paintings were on display, and many of the members of the society spoke of her with great fondness. The society is open to all artists and goes from strength to strength, and I certainly, along with many other members of my community, look forward to attending the annual art show again next year.
