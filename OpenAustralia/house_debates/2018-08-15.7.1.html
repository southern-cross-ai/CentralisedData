        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable and premature death and disability in Australia. Australia is a world leader in tobacco control and was the first country to introduce tobacco plain packaging. The plain packaging measure remains an important element of Australia's tobacco control measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is committed to reduce the number of people taking up smoking and to assist those already smoking to quit. While progress has been made, 12.8 per cent of Australians aged 14 years or older still smoke daily, and, every year, smoking kills an estimated 19,000 Australians and costs the community $31.5 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011, plain packaging compliance and enforcement activities are undertaken by authorised officers. Authorised officers must be persons appointed or engaged under the Public Service Act 1999or a member or special member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        . A person is appointed as an authorised officer in writing by the secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        , who must be satisfied that the person has suitable qualifications, training or experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill proposes to expand the range of persons who can be appointed as authorised officers for the purposes of undertaking compliance and enforcement activities. The bill will allow the secretary to appoint as authorised officers Commonwealth officers not appointed or engaged under the Public Service Act 1999, state and territory policer officers, and state, territory and local government officers with responsibilities for health or tobacco control matters. The secretary must still be satisfied that any person appointed as an authorised officer has suitable qualifications, training or experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will enable the government to respond more flexibly to non-compliance with the tobacco plain packaging legislation. The bill will provide the Department of Health with access to a wider pool of officers eligible for appointment as authorised officers, providing greater flexibility to respond to any organisational and administrative changes which may occur in the future. This will also provide more opportunities for authorised officers to cooperate and respond to potential noncompliance. This bill does not change the plain packaging requirements and will not impact the obligations of tobacco manufacturers, distributors or retailers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consultation was undertaken with each state and territory agency in which officers may become authorised officers in the future as a result of the amendment, and with each state and territory local government association. The bill will improve plain packaging compliance and enhance enforcement capabilities to support the government's tobacco control measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
