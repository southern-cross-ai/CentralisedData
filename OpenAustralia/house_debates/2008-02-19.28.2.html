        Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. On 14 February the Prime Minister stated in the House that the Howard government averaged 63 question times. In fact, that is the figure for all years of the Howard government. A more accurate comparison—

           It is a question to the Speaker. A more accurate comparison with the 67 question times scheduled for 2008, a non-election year, is the comparison with non-election years in the Howard government, when the average was 70. Will you request that the Prime Minister return to the House to correct the record with the more accurate figure?

             I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. Referring to the last answer given by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, I do not know whether you are expecting this side of the House to call a point of order when there is clearly a ministerial statement being given as an answer to a question.

               Mr Speaker, during question time today the opposition raised I think 19 points of order, including in answers that were less than 20 seconds into the answer. Notwithstanding the provisions of standing order 86, I would ask whether or not you would consider, as previous Speakers have, reviewing the use of standing orders and points of order to disrupt the business of the House, which has in the past been viewed as disorderly and is in contravention of standing order 91—

                The honourable member for Brisbane will resume his seat. The answer is the same as to the member for

                . I will not be entering into a question and answer session about proceedings of question time. If people are aggrieved about my actions in the chair, they should raise them at the time. If they think that the points of order are disorderly, I would ask that that be raised at the time. I am not making general comments about the proceedings of the parliament. At this point in time the Speaker may be asked questions about those matters under his or her administration.

                    I do not wish to encourage interjections. The problem that has occurred when we have entered into these discussions is that it leads people to believe that the person raising the question is reflecting on the chair. I do not think that that is the case. The point that I would make is that I do not think that there is any advantage by people asking for advisory rulings. The Chief Government Whip by his body language can just be a bit careful, because I am trying to set the scene. He interjected at one stage about points of order and their disruptive nature, and I tend to agree with that. But that might be best raised at the time and not by way of advisory rulings. That is all I am simply saying.
