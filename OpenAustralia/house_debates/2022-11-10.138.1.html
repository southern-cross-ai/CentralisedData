        My question is to the Prime Minister. What upcoming international summits will the Prime Minister be attending? And how will this enhance Australia's security and our economy?

         The Indo-Pacific is absolutely critical to regional prosperity and security and to the future of our nation. That's why I'm particularly pleased to have accepted President Widodo's invitation to be one of the three speakers at the B20 meeting, along with himself as chair of the current G20 and Prime Minister Modi as the next incoming chair of the G20. This meeting will be attended by the leaders of Australian businesses, including the heads of

         These conferences come at a critical time. We know that the global financial outlook is stark. We know that there is rising inflation throughout the world. We know that geostrategic tensions are intensifying. And we've seen the impact of climate change globally as well. One of the many truths that the pandemic made clear is that what happens in the rest of the world matters here at home as well. That unfortunately has been driven home by the global impact of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Even though that's half a world away, Australian families are feeling the impact here, and the Australian government—in a bipartisan way, I must say—has been supportive and will continue to support the heroic struggle of the people of Ukraine against this trashing of international law.
        </p>
        <p>
         Supply chain breakdowns across the world mean that Australians are seeing price spikes and shortages. We must work together with our international partners to tackle inflation, to tackle skills shortages and to tackle climate change. That's how we can grow our economy at home and promote stability in our region. We're showing that Australia is back as a partner and as a leader, bringing a calm, mature and collaborative approach to international relations and standing up for Australia's interests wherever and whenever we need to. We will be raising issues of Australia's national interest at these meetings. The Treasurer will be joining me at the B20 and for the beginning of the G20 in Indonesia as well. I congratulate President Widodo, our friend, for the work that he has done in organising this important international summit, which is an important recognition of the standing that Indonesia has as it rises, along with India, to be in the top five economies in the world over coming decades.
