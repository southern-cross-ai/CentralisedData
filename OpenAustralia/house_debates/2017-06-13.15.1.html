       <p>
        Yesterday, two deserving Maranoa residents were awarded the prestigious
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . I would like to take this opportunity today to congratulate and thank them for their years of service. Firstly, Barcoo Shire Mayor Bruce Scott has spent 23 years advocating for the people of some of the most remote parts of Australia. Put simply, Mayor Scott does not just do a job; he lives and breathes serving people of far west and remote Queensland. His commitment to improving communications in the bush is something I deeply admire and respect. Mayor Scott knows the ins and outs of the communications landscape and was heavily involved in securing optic fibre across multiple shires to provide high-speed internet access to Windorah, Birdsville, Bedourie, Jundah and Stonehenge. On a recent visit to the Windorah State School with Mayor Scott, it was obvious to me that the heart of his drive is absolutely about those children and giving them the very best opportunity in life.

        Secondly, I would like to congratulate and thank
