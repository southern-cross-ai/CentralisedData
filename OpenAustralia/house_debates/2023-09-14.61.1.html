        is so important in my electorate of Tangney. If I'm not doorknocking my constituents and speaking about the issues of the day, I will be at local activities, celebrations and events in my seat. As I have said before, one very popular activity has been my constituent coffee catch-ups. I was most recently joined by the federal Minister for Trade and Tourism and the WA state member for Bateman, alongside the local business community, for a coffee catch-up at Nic &amp; Kolo in Applecross. It was so wonderful to share this experience with the minister and give our constituents time to speak to the minister about the issues and matters concerning them the most. I want to thank the minister for listening to my constituents' thoughts, feedback and ideas for our local businesses and community.
       </p>
       <p>
        To everyone that has come to my constituent coffee catch-ups: thank you. Your advice, feedback and sharing of experiences has made me a better representative for you. If you have not had the chance to come to my coffee catch-ups, you're always welcome to one. I have one more coming this Saturday. There are many more opportunities across my electorate to catch up, before or after workâ€”even on weekends. I look forward to seeing you all soon.
