         for his question. This is a very important day. Today Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Negus" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Negus
         </a>
         was sworn in as Commissioner of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         effective from today. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Acting Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia and me, as well representatives from other police jurisdictions and many other distinguished guests. It was a very important event.
        </p>
        <p>
         Commissioner Negus has had a distinguished 27 years in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and has worked across the spectrum in the Australian Federal Police. He has worked in community policing, federal investigations, human resources, training and protection. He has worked overseas and understands the growing need to engage with counterparts within our region and across the world. He is highly regarded. I am sure the opposition would agree that the new Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is highly regarded and widely respected by his Australian domestic and international law enforcement colleagues as well as the AFP’s many partner law enforcement agencies. The commissioner has most recently held responsibility for high-tech crime operations, border activities, international liaison networks, economic and special operations, forensics and the international deployment group, and he is extremely well qualified to lead this very important law enforcement agency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tony Negus said today, after being sworn in by the acting chief justice, that protecting the Australian community against the threat of terrorism and serious organised crime will remain the primary focus of the Australian Federal Police’s policing activities. This is a focus that the Rudd government fully endorses. The AFP is 30 years old and is entering a significant phase in its development. Commissioner Negus will be working, supported by the Rudd government, to deliver more sworn police onto the front-line investigations in the fight against organised crime and transnational crime and terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         In welcoming this appointment, the government would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of the outgoing commissioner, Commissioner Mick Keelty, in his leading role of the AFP since 2001. Commissioner Kelty has demonstrated an outstanding leadership during a period of significant growth in the size, the nature and the complexity of the AFP’s operations in Australia and abroad. He also led the AFP through a challenging period including events such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Bali bombings, the Jakarta embassy bombing, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
          Indian Ocean
         </a>
         tsunami disaster and the 2003 Canberra bushfires. Commissioner Keelty has played a key role in driving greater cooperation and coordination in law enforcement operations with a number of Commonwealth and state authorities and has forged important relationships with law enforcement partners throughout the region. He leaves a lasting legacy within the Australian Federal Police and in law enforcement generally in Australia and within the region.
