        The South Australian Living Arts Festival is on, and Boothby has once again embraced it. By my count, there are at least 56 venues across Boothby holding exhibitions this year, ranging from community and commercial art galleries, cafes and restaurants through to community centres. On Friday night, along with Emily Bourke

        . This inclusive art studio tags its exhibition as an opportunity to 'revel in unconventional, progressive art from artists who are not afraid to take risks'.

        The crowd was escorted around the exhibition by performance artists Kurt Bosecke, Mathew Leigh-Tamblyn and Dougie Jacobssen in character, and we were treated to a large range of artworks, from paintings, drawings and sculptures to T-shirts, digital art installations and much more. True to the exhibition's title, there were biscuits as well. The standout pieces included some digitally enhanced pictures that move when viewed through an app, by Matthew Cawthorne,

        SALA Festival is on this month, and the Tutti exhibition is open Monday to Friday from 10 to two at their centre in Brighton. Congratulations to all of the artists.
