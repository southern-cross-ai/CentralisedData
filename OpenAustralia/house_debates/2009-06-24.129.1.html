        It is hard to get all we want to put into these statements in the time allotted. It has been a month of anniversaries in south Gippsland.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Creek" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        celebrated the 125th anniversary of the town’s first settlement. There was an amazing parade of wedding gowns down through the ages in Fish Creek. Some 500 to 800 people returned to Fish Creek. This celebration tied in very well with the 90th anniversary of South Gippsland Secondary College, formerly the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_High_School" rel="nofollow">

        . It was estimated that several thousand people returned on the Saturday to their old school.

        Special thanks must go to Colleen Smith and her family, who worked so tirelessly to coordinate the reunion. Colleen and her hardworking family made sure that the weekend ran smoothly from start to finish. Catering for 2,000-plus people is no mean feat. Trudy Haines, with her family and friends, also made an amazing and enormous contribution to a successful reunion. The celebrations went on all weekend. It was a most memorable weekend for both the Fish Creek and Foster communities.

        We also celebrated a 70th wedding anniversary, that of Beth and

        . Seventy years married for all of us seems a lifetime—nearly a couple of generations. This couple were presented with a certificate from the mayor—we do not call them shire presidents anymore—John Duscher. Celebrations, I believe, are still going on today for that 70th wedding anniversary.

        Church, my own church, with congratulations on the 125th anniversary that they celebrated. As a member of St James Pakenham since the early seventies I have had the great honour of receiving the ministry of Stephen Rigby,

        bushfires—Ian Battersby and Hilary Roath. Their faithfulness to their congregation has been a cornerstone of life in the church. I am reminded of the faithful dedication of the eight o’clock service community who worship in the coldest of mornings, from the days of the Purten brothers, Cecil and Ken, to today’s faithful servants.
       </p>
       <p>
        All servants of the church are precious, and to pick out for special recognition only two is fraught with danger. However, such is the contribution from Dot Hardy and Margaret Walden in music and prayer that I am willing to take the risk. Music has been such an important part of the life of St James for such a long time. Their wonderful gift to us through their music has raised the spirits of the congregation and blessed us with each and every note that they have played. At this 125th anniversary we honour all who have worshipped and served at St James. We give thanks to the blessings of those who have passed through the doors of the house and for the solace and comfort found in the bosom of the congregation.
