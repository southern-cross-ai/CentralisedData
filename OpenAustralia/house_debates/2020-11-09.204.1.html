        Every year, I host the Coral
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLean" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Awards, which recognise the contribution of women in our community in building better neighbourhoods or improving the quality of lives of people across the Chifley electorate. This year I was particularly determined to hold the awards, given the circumstances of the pandemic and the extra effort that's been provided through this period of time. I want to acknowledge the efforts of three women in particular in the Chifley electorate. I start with the winner, Nene Brown, who won the Coral McLean Award. Nene is a small-business owner who, at the height of the pandemic, made low-cost, home-cooked meals for local pensioners and struggling families, many times out of her own pocket. Monica Wasif was named as Chifley Young Woman of the Year for her role as chair of her school's student leadership council, leading students on numerous fundraising projects. And Rachael Hanlon, a long-time member of the Blacktown City Lions Club, received the MP Recognition Award, because I know firsthand of the contribution she's made to fundraising, supporting Blacktown and

        , driving Indigenous reading collections and working on local initiatives to tackle domestic violence. I congratulate them all on their dedication and the difference they've made, along with the people who were nominated, all in the spirit of Coral McLean, after whom the awards were named. Coral McLean was known as the 'Mother of Mount Druitt' for her enormous contribution to the community. Again, I congratulate every one of them for their help and effort.
