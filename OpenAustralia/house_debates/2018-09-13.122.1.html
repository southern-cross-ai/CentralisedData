        It is the season of celebration for many of the sporting and community clubs in my electorate of Boothby. It's a celebration of their wins and milestones of the season past and the hardworking volunteers and club members who contribute so much to our community. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight just a few of the great sporting successes.
       </p>

        I congratulate the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club, which was recently awarded Club of the Year at the South Australian Surf Life Saving awards. Some of the club's members were also recognised on the night with individual awards, and I congratulate all of these amazing volunteers. In addition, the wonderful partnership between the club and Suneden Specialist School, which is also in my electorate, was awarded the Community Education Program of the Year, and is a great credit to all involved. I congratulate everyone at the clubâ€”in particular, retiring club president

        It has been a very successful 2018 season for the

        rugby club. The premier grade won the grand final on the weekend, and I was also delighted to see their women's side and many of the junior teams playing finals. I congratulate the players, coaching staff and club president Wayne Londema on a very successful season. I'm sure everyone at the club is looking forward to the 2019 season, both on and off the field, as construction is due to start on their new clubrooms as part of the Brighton Oval redevelopment.

        I want to congratulate the Marion Rams football club on their premiership win this past weekend. This is a remarkable one. Their grand final win is a huge achievement because the club had been completely winless over the past two seasons. I congratulate all of the players and supporters. I congratulate captain

        and caretaker coach Michael O'Dea. I also extend my congratulations and very best wishes to coach Ben Porter, who suffered a stroke during a team training session just two weeks ago but joined the team to celebrate the win in the final minutes before the siren.
       </p>
       <p>
        As grand final season comes to an end, I would like to wish all those teams who still have games to play the very best of luck. Good luck to the

        under-14s and also to their A-grade team, who I hope we will soon be calling back-to-back premiers. The Brighton Lacrosse Club have 10 junior and senior teams in this weekend's grand finals, including their fantastic state women's league team. Congratulations and thank you to all of these players, coaches, club members and supporters. All the best this weekend, and thank you to my incredible community volunteers and club members at all of our clubs across the electorate, who do so much work for our community, keeping people active and making sure that we are all fit, healthy and friendly, are playing sport and are staying as active as possible.
