        Sport plays such an important role in the lives of our young people. Whether it is swimming at the local pool or participating in a community netball or football team, sport helps our young people stay fit and healthy as well as developing vital social skills in leadership and cooperation. This afternoon, I rise to speak about five exceptional young sport stars from the Ryan electorate who have been named as some of the region's latest local sporting champions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Genevieve West from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_Tree_Pocket" rel="nofollow">
         Fig Tree Pocket
        </a>
        recently attended the under 13 Queensland state hockey championships. Genevieve said it was a fantastic opportunity to represent not only Brisbane but her community hockey club, South West United. Genevieve has played hockey since she was six years old and wants to show other players that they too can achieve when they work hard and believe in themselves. Genevieve says she is the smallest in her representative team and I think that shows to all the other young hockey players that size does not matter; it is the spirit that counts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Giverny Kenman from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karana_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Karana Downs
        </a>
        attended the 12 years and under girls football state championships. Giverny has been playing club soccer since she was six years old and has since made the school, district and regional teams. She travelled to Mackay for the state championships and said the opportunity to play with and against the other girls and learn more from some great coaches has helped improve her own game.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harrison Maynard from Moggill is an up-and-coming track and field star and recently attended the Queensland school sport track and field championships. After finishing ninth in the Queensland state cross country championships, Harrison increased his training and won the regional 800 metres before qualifying for the track and field championships in Cairns. At the championships, Harrison had the opportunity to test himself against the best in the state for the first time.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bell" rel="nofollow">
         Laura Bell
        </a>
        from Pullenvale recently competed in the interschool Queensland state equestrian championships. Laura previously qualified to ride at the state level, but sadly her horse went lame. Although juggling a tough study workload in her final year of school, Laura was successful in qualifying for the state championships held in Maryborough. Laura hopes that her recent success will help her reach her ultimate goal of representing Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will Prest from Kenmore has just attended the under 13 men's hockey national championships. Will is an exceptional hockey player and was the youngest member of the team. He said that competing in the championships gave him the opportunity to develop his skills and improve his chances of one day playing for the Kookaburras.

        I am extremely proud to have these outstanding young sporting champions in the Ryan electorate. I congratulate them all for their outstanding achievements in their chosen sports and wish them well for their future sporting endeavours.
