        This week, those of the Hindu religion and with origins in India will begin their celebration of Deepavali. Deepavali is one the biggest Hindu festivals, and it is celebrated with great enthusiasm and happiness in Perth. The festival is celebrated over five days, and it is on the third day that the main Deepavali festival, or festival of lights, is celebrated. Deepavali is known for its colourful varieties of fireworks. On the main Deepavali people light up diyas, and candles are all around their houses. They sing the Hindu prayer song

        in the evening and seek the divine blessings of the goddess of wealth. The festival of Deepavali also includes an exchange of gifts. I understand that the key dates are Dhanteras on 9 November, Choti Diwali on 10 November, Deepavali on 11 November and

        on 13 November. Although most of those of Indian origin in Cowan are Hindu, there are also Christians, who are often from Goa, Sikhs and Jains. I know that on the same night as Deepavali the Jains also celebrate a festival of lights to mark the attainment of moksha or freedom from the cycle of birth and death by Mahavira, whilst the Sikhs celebrate

        or the release from prison of the sixth guru. We are therefore in a celebration period of not just Hindus but most of those with origins in India.

        It is, however, at this time important that I also use this opportunity to speak of the great contribution that many of these constituents have made to our community. The President of the Indian Society of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , Mukesh Jain, obviously of the Jain faith, has for many years superbly led the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISWA" rel="nofollow">
         ISWA
        </a>
        community. He and his committee have organised many profile events, and these events such as Deepavali and Indian national day have greatly increased the profile of the community and the positive way in which Indians are viewed in Western Australia. We are in fact in the middle of a series of Deepavali events across Perth, and I want to congratulate the Indian Society and all those involved for the hard work they have put in to deliver a wonderful 2015 Deepavali in Perth. I will name vice-president Samir, secretary Surya, assistant secretary Virendra, treasurer Ramkrishna and assistant Jignesh.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being the member for Cowan, I want to speak about the main community of Indian origin in Cowan. They are the Gujarartis. Gujarat is a state in the western part of India, but many of those in Cowan have come here from other countries. The Guajarati community is called the Gujarat Samaj, and the president is Yogesh Jogia. Gujarartis are renowned for being entrepreneurs, and it is common that they are business owners. By way of example, it does seem that most of the Cheesecake Shop franchisees seem to be Gujarartis, and Gujaratis are very much involved in running other small- and medium-sized businessesâ€”alternatively, there are many professionals amongst them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course there are many other groups of Indian origin in Cowan. There are the Sikhs, and there are those from the Odisha state, Goa, as I have mentioned, and many other places. Those of Indian origin, whether it is recent or distant, have made a wonderful contribution in Western Australia and also in the electorate of Cowan. They are a significant community and they add great and positive value. I hope that they all enjoy Deepavali and continue their efforts for themselves and for our country.
