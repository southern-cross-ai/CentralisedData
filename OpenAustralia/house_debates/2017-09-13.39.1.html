       <p>
        I rise in this chamber today to officially pass on the gratitude of a local widow in my community, Ms Penny Peel. Ms Peel is the widow of Lindsay John Peel, who was a petty officer with the Navy for 25 years. Mr Peel's service finished some years ago, but it had long been his desire to have his ashes scattered at sea. Upon her husband's death, Ms Peel contacted the Navy to formally request the scattering of her husband's ashes, and their response was swift. They told Ms Peel, 'Of course, you are our family,' and said that everything that could be done would be done to see Mr Peel's wish carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to report in the House today that, on what would have been Mr Peel's 78th birthday, this was done. I wrote to Ms Peel last night to tell her that I would announce this good news in the House today, and she replied immediately, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has been through the efforts of Lieutenant Commander Mark Burton and Lieutenant Commander Ned Sparkes that this matter has been successfully accomplished. These two men are very special, and the country should be very proud of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        She also wished to pass on her thanks to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs,

        , and the Prime Minister. I'm so pleased to say that Ms Peel would like to say thank you to all in our community for their dedication in seeing her husband's final wish carried out.
