       <p>
        Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of joining members of two local governments in my electorate and members of state government at the launch, the opening, the sod turning, of the Magill Village precinct redevelopment. This is the final stage in this redevelopment. The first was undergrounding the powerlines, which all occurred about two years ago. Thanks to funding from the Commonwealth, state and local governments, we are now seeing the completion of that project with the $8 million street re-scaping along that precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        I start by paying tribute and thanking the Burnside council and the Campbell town council. Mayors Anne Monceaux and Jill Whittaker were there, as well as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        s, Chris Cowley and Paul Di Iulio; and elected members and staff who have been very supportive of that project for a very long time. I'm pleased that at a Commonwealth level we've been able to contribute to it and that, more recently, the state government, through some of their COVID stimulus response funding, have put money in as well. It's going to be a great outcome for local businesses in the area and, most importantly, for residents and local families. The streetscaping and the improved amenity that that will bring to the area is going to be transformative for people that live nearby. It will change the way families can enjoy themselves locally on the weekends. I'm very pleased to be a part of a government that has contributed to delivering this excellent local project in my electorate.
