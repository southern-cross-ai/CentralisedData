        Paul Lennon AO from Broadmarsh in my electorate is a former Tasmanian Labor premier. He is recognised as an officer of the General Division of the Order of Australia for his role in diversifying Tasmania's economy and his efforts in driving reconciliation with the state's Aboriginal community. Michael Polley AM, from Longford, is also a member of the Order of Australia. A former speaker of the

He served in the Tasmanian parliament for 41 years before retiring last year after becoming one of the youngest state ministers at the time, at the age of 26 in 1976. He continues to serve on the
