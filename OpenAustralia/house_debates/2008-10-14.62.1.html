        I have recently had the pleasure of nominating two people for the WA Seniors Awards 2008 for the extraordinary impact they have had in the local area. I nominated Mr David Harvey in the local community achievement category for his tireless work as an advocate for his local community, the Bentley Park Retirement Village. The retirement village is home to approximately 1,100 residents. David moved to the village in 2000 and ever since has shown excellent leadership on behalf of his community. He successfully led the resistance to a proposed council levy on non-government organisations that would have had severe financial implications for its residents. David managed to build sufficient momentum to have the proposal withdrawn. David also showed leadership during the establishment of the Boronia Pre-Release Centre for Women adjacent to the retirement village. The prison opened in 2004 and is designed to prepare about 70 women for reintegration into society. David became actively involved in the community advisory group, which is made up of local residents and business operators who meet monthly with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Corrective_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Corrective Services
        </a>
        staff to provide community input, feedback and involvement into the centre’s operations. David’s commitment and conviction in representing his community makes him an outstanding candidate for this award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also nominated Ms Inge Dahners of Manning in the business participation category for her positive impact on the lives of aged people confronting challenges such as dementia, declining health and diminishing independence. Inge has worked as a professional at Southcare for the last 20 years and is currently the aged program manager. Southcare is a charitable organisation based in Manning in my electorate of Swan. Inge and her team, including many volunteers, provide the means to keep aged people as independent as possible and in their own environment for as long as possible. Among her many outstanding contributions, Inge worked tirelessly to start and achieve funding for the Bickley Club. The Bickley Club provides services specifically for people who have dementia, as well as for their carers. Services include transport to and from the centre, a midday meal, respite for carers, outings, shopping trips, information, personal support, recreational activities and a carers support group.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without Inge, the development of this project would have been impossible. I am very happy to be able to inform the House that Inge Dahners is a finalist in her category. I think she would be a deserving winner of the prize. David and Inge demonstrate the extraordinary impact that seniors have in our society. Their stories represent the countless seniors who go beyond the call of duty. We owe them a great deal of gratitude and must enable their work by providing suitable funding in the future.
