       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to organisations within the federal electorate of Hindmarsh, cornerstones of our community that continue their exemplary work for their members, for their constituency and for the community at large. These organisations, the Henley and Grange
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and the Aged Care and Housing Group, which works in close conjunction with the Plympton Glenelg RSL, were recently acknowledged by the Rudd Labor government and were granted assistance through the governmentâ€™s veteran and community grants program. The program provides an important source of funding to local organisations, such as these, for projects and initiatives that support the health and wellbeing of the veteran community. These grants provide funding to local organisations to meet the needs of veterans, war widows, widowers and their dependants. It is important to note that in many instances these projects also benefit the wider community. Projects funded by veteran and community grants include projects promoting healthy lifestyles, community activities, projects helping veterans to live independently at home and carers support.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the recipients of the grants was the Henley and Grange RSL, which is organised by their tireless secretary, Mrs Kaye Moseley. They recently received $10,068 to assist with the cost of purchasing chairs, tables and an air conditioner. Kaye is an exemplary secretary who does many hours of volunteer work at the Henley and Grange RSL, and she should be recognised for the tremendous work that she does in that area with the RSL and with veterans. The other one was the Aged Care and Housing Group, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACH" rel="nofollow">
         ACH
        </a>
        Group. That is an organisation that provides a great many services for senior South Australians within and beyond Hindmarsh.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Grant Schmerl is also a tireless worker and has been instrumental, in conjunction with the Plympton Glenelg RSL, in the development and operation of what they call a swap-links program. This swap-links program brings veterans together who perhaps would not otherwise have any outings for lunches and for other activities. It increases the opportunity for seniors in the vicinity of the RSL to also re-engage with the community, take care of themselves and make more out of life. So I was particularly pleased when Ms Julie Bonnici, the regional manager of the ACH Group, was granted $44,000 for the ongoing delivery of the swap-links program. Ms Julie Bonnici is also a tireless worker who gives her all in that area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate those at the Henley and Grange RSL, the ACH Group and Plympton Glenelg RSL, as well as Ms Kaye Moseley, Julie Bonnici and Grant Schmerl, for the tremendous work that they do and for their successful grant applications. These organisations do terrific work and are the cornerstones of our community.
