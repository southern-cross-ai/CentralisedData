       <p>
        I call the member for Bass. Today I'm thrilled to speak on a wonderful community leader who has aptly been described as the heart and soul of the northern suburbs community. Denise Delphin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , you are an absolute gem. After 37 years devoted to creating a stronger connected and empowered community, Denise will be retiring from her role at the Northern Suburbs Community Centre. Starting off as a volunteer at the local Neighbourhood House in 1983, Denise became a committee member and coordinator before becoming community centre manager and coordinator in 1999. Two years ago, Denise took on the role of general manager.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've come to know Denise as she's been known to the community: a tireless, dedicated and inspirational leader who has left a wonderful legacy. A colleague described Denise as the mother of the northern suburbs. Denise's work received high recognition last year when she was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . Through the flourishing community gardens to Men's Sheds, partnerships with Health Tasmania and, the most recent, Adventure Play, to name a few, the local community has had access to a number of health and wellbeing programs that have made a demonstrable difference to those who've utilised the services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delivery of these programs would not have been possible without the tireless work of Denise and the incredible team she has built around her. Denise, you will be sadly and sorely missed, but I, along with your beloved community, wish you all the best for what lies ahead.
