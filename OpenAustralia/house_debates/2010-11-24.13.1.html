It is expected that the co-location into a single new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and efficiency, long-term viability and maintenance. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $54.2 million plus

        Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in May 2011 and be completed by 31 October 2012. The developer has initiated work on site with the excavation and pier-drilling of the basement areas already underway. The ATO is expected to take up occupancy of the building in November 2012. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

       <p>
        Known as Bayriver, the site will be subdivided into 123 lots capable of accommodating a mix of detached homes and medium density terrace style houses. The lots not required for defence will be sold to the general public, creating a mixed civilian and defence community and reducing DHAâ€™s net outlay. The total outturn cost proposal is estimated at $38.2 million, inclusive of GST and land acquisition, with the net costs reduced through the sales of surplus lots.

       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. DHA accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, development will commence in April 2011 and housing construction will commence in December 2011. Housing construction will be completed in November 2012.

The proposed works will provide the Navy upgraded operational and training facilities at HMAS Penguin and Pittwater Annexe to enable Navy to meet its training commitments. The proposed works, estimated to cost $63.34 million plus GST, will include redevelopment of the waterfront, site civil works and the upgrade of base services and infrastructure at HMAS Penguin, along with an internal refurbishment of the Pittwater Annexe. Refurbishment of two historic waterfront buildings at HMAS Penguin will preserve them for future generations. Traffic management will be improved on Middle Head Road, with proposed changes to the base entry.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Infrastructure and upgrade works at the Immigration Detention Centre at Northam, WA.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 18 October 2010 the government announced that new detention facilities will be developed to take pressure off Australiaâ€™s existing migration detention network. As a result of this announcement, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        has identified a site on Commonwealth land in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        to establish a detention facility. The site encompasses part of the Northam training camp, which is a large defence site 80 kilometres north-east of Perth. This facility will be developed to accommodate up to 1,500 single, adult males. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $164.5 million plus GST and is inclusive of capital expenditure. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence within four weeks and be completed by mid-2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        The House would be aware that existing detention facilities are nearing capacity, and it is incumbent on the government to provide appropriate accommodation for irregular maritime arrivals. Because of the pressure on existing facilities and the need to treat people in a humane way, the government needs to act quickly to engage contractors and begin the necessary work. The proposal to proceed with a construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common. The government very much supports the work of the Public Works Committee and has not taken this decision lightly. I commend the motion to the House.
