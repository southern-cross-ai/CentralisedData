        The Department of Defence is proposing a project to provide new facilities and infrastructure works at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Edinburgh
        </a>
        , South Australia, to enable the 16th Regiment,

         Royal Australian Artillery
        </a>
        —the regiment—to support new air defence capabilities. The project will replace the existing portable laser-guided surface-to-air missile system operated by the regiment with a significantly larger and more capable vehicle based air defence system. New working and support facilities at RAAF Base Edinburgh will replace the regiment's existing facilities, which are not fit for purpose and would not enable an acceptable operating level to be achieved for the new air defence capability. The total estimated capital delivery cost of the project is $213.9 million. The works must be referred, considered by and reported on to both houses of the parliament by the Public Works Committee before work may commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction works are expected to commence in late 2022 and scheduled to be completed by late 2024. I commend the motion to the House.

The proposed works are part of a keystone project within the Townsville City Waterfront Priority Development Area and support the Townsville City Deal. The proposed works will provide visitors with a range of immersive experiences and revitalised exhibits, including educational activities, hands-on experiences, on-site diving programs, scientific demonstrations and the use of interactive technology. The works will be conducted concurrently with renewal works that were approved by the Public Works Committee in June 2020. The total estimated cost of the project is $40 million excluding
