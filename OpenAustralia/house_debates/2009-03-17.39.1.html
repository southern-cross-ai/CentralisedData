        My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahroonga_Public_School" rel="nofollow">

        in my electorate, which is seeking funding under the National School Pride program for perimeter safety fencing for its school. The school has received two quotes for this project. The first is from the state government’s preferred contractor, which is Spotless, for $40,122, which it has been told it must accept. The second quote is from a local fencing company for $22,660. I ask the minister: why is it necessary to spend an additional $17,000 of taxpayers’ hard-earned money on this project when a local company, employing local businessmen and contractors, can do the job for almost half the price?

         I thank the member for his question, which is a serious question. I can assure the member that we are working with state governments on the section of the biggest modernisation program schools have ever had in this country which involves state schools. We are working with state governments so that we can involve local providers throughout the states, throughout

         and throughout the country. If there is a problem at his school in relation to that issue of engaging local people then I am more than happy to work with him to get that issue resolved.
        </p>
        <p>
         The message we are consistently giving to state governments and block grant authorities in the independent and Catholic school sectors is that, because this is a school program that is part of an economic stimulus package, we want it supporting jobs around the country. We obviously want to maximise the engagement of local tradespeople. On that very specific school example I am more than happy to work with the member to resolve it. I remember when positions were reversed, and the member was Minister for Education, that we spent a very happy day at
