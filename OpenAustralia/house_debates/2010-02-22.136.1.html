        As a fan of country music I would like to congratulate several established and up-and-coming exponents of the genre who have done the City of Grafton proud recently. The hugely talented

        —sisters Brooke, Samantha and Mollie—who also hail from Grafton and who hosted this year’s awards. Samantha joked that there must be something in the Clarence Valley water because Grafton musicians dominated the prestigious talent competitions. Former south Graftonian Luke Austen took out the Toyota Star Maker competition, winning a recording deal, video clip and 12 months use of a car. A local, Aaron Bolton, was a finalist in the Road to Tamworth competition and budding instrumentalist Tullara Connors, of Ramornie, won the right to perform on the final day of the festival. All this has led to the suggestion that Grafton should stage an annual country concert, perhaps at Easter, with its home-grown stars returning to perform. I will be buying tickets for that show.
