        The federal Labor government has cut $150 million from the Safer Communities Fund, a program that was used by the previous government to deliver

        </a>
        cameras in my community of the Redlands. The program was designed to assist communities to feel safe by reducing crime and addressing antisocial behaviour. A Liberal and Nationals government utilised the fund to deliver some much needed CCTV cameras around the Redlands, and I was hoping to utilise it to continue to deliver even more. Redlands

        was the beneficiary of two grants totalling over $110,000. The funding provided for 31 CCTV cameras in known hotspots such as Capalaba Place and Weinam Creek ferry terminal and car park at

        residents have reported to me that they now feel a lot safer at night as they park, make their way to their vehicles and await their ferries.

        The CCTV initiatives were the result of a collaboration between council, police, and the state and federal governments. Through local business input and community feedback, they identified known trouble spots where the cameras would be most effective. I was hoping to utilise the funding to deliver new CCTV cameras at Cleveland Point and other local hooning hotspots. During the election campaign we committed to invest $175,000 for this purpose. I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government to reverse this decision and restore the funding that has served my community so well.
