       <p>
        I am delighted today to present one part of a three-part monster petition that has been approved by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions. I support the call of the petition and call on the government to take active steps to reduce atmospheric carbon, safeguard industry in regional Australia and pursue an equitable approach to climate policy for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition of Australia's daughters and sons, parents, grandparents, godparents, aunts and uncles draws to the attention of the House the damage to the earth's climate and its oceans from humanity's continuing and increasing carbon emissions and the consequent severe risks to the future health, safety and wellbeing of all our children and our children's children and future generations. The petitioners ask the House to respect the science and build a safe climate future for our children and grandchildren and for generations to come by enacting immediate and deep reductions to Australia's carbon emissions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The monster petition started with a conversation between Judy Brett, Clare Wright, Dur-e Dara and Mary Crooks at the Victorian Women's Trust and has had outstanding support by the lead petitioner, Professor Fiona Stanley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        . Thanks to those who took the lead on the petition and thank you to the 72,000-plus women, men and children who have put their names to this petition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The petition read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of Australia's daughters and sons, parents, grandparents, godparents, aunts and uncles, draws to the attention of the House the damage to the earth's climate and its oceans from humanity's continuing and increasing carbon emissions and the consequent severe risks to the future health, safety and well-being of our children and our children's children and future generations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We remind the House that it is the fundamental duty of parliament, including this House, to protect Australia's people, land and seas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to respect the science and build a safe climate future for our children and grandchildren and generations to come by enacting immediate and deep reductions to Australia's carbon emissions. We also ask the House to commit to and actively promote and support global strategies for immediate and deep reductions to global emissions at every designated international forum.
