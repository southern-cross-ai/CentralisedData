        They all said a citizens advice bureau couldn't be done, but Tina, with a chuckle, replied that maybe it couldn't but she would be the one who wouldn't say no till she tried. I was greatly blessed to be at the celebration of 40 years of service to the community by the South Gippsland Citizens Advice Bureau from 1978 to 2008 and of 10 years of service for the visitors information centre. Part of that celebration was Tina Bons, who had served for 40 years, and the amazing Shirley Reeves, who has also served for 40 years. That is to say nothing of the other hundreds of volunteers who have served the citizens advice bureaus not only in Leongatha but right across my electorate and surrounds in Victoria. These have been amazing people. If you were to count it up, they think they've done 150,000 interviews with people in just the Leongatha centre. Imagine the hours that went into that for volunteers. Maxine Kiel, the Tarwin Valley ward councillor said:

        They are all an inspiration and it is a privilege to be part of their current committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We do not volunteer, for the most part, because it benefits ourselves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We volunteer because it makes a difference.
       </p>

        What an amazing group of people and what a contribution they've made to their community. It couldn't be done, they said. It was done and it's still being done.
