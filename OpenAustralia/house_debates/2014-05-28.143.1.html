       <p>
        I rise today to praise a fantastic organisation in my electorate for bringing hope and support to many children and their families in Macarthur.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kids" rel="nofollow">
         The Kids
        </a>
        of Macarthur Health Foundation has been a huge support to many families in the Macarthur community and over the years has grown into one of the most highly regard and well-respected charities in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The humble beginnings of the foundation are like many others in Macarthur. A group of like-minded people came together with a common goal to make life easier for children and their families in our community. The Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation was established in 2000 by a group of local business leaders, paediatricians and hospital administrators, and 13 years later it now raises enough funds to donate around $1 million every four years to purchase paediatric medical equipment for our local hospitals and families. This is an achievement that current staff, volunteers and the founding members of the foundation should be very proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year the foundation holds an annual charity ball so that local residents, community groups and businesses can join together to support this worthy cause. This year the ball will be held on Saturday, 21 June at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cube" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Campbelltown Catholic Club. This year's ball will raise funds to purchase omnicots for the Special Care Nursery at Campbelltown Hospital. These state-of-the-art humidicribs will help stabilise particularly fragile and at-risk newborns throughout the various stages of their treatment while in hospital. Each omnicot costs $42,000 and will allow Campbelltown Hospital to provide high care to these babies, instead of transporting them off site to special care. Every child in Macarthur benefits from the work of the Kids of Macarthur, whether they are a child with special needs, a disability or an injury from an accident. This is why I encourage Macarthur residents to attend the charity ball to support the organisation that has become such a vital asset to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since its inception, the foundation has become a lifeline for many families in my electorate. During my time as a local councillor and as the member for Macarthur, I have met many local families who have shared their stories with me about the wonderful support they have received from the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation. The foundation's dedication to improving health care for every child living in the Macarthur region is held with high regard by all levels of government, local support groups, schools and families in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        By raising money and advocating for children and adolescent health services, and research in Macarthur, the foundation has set a high standard for many other local charities and support groups. The foundation's success relies on the kindness of local residents and businesses who continue to support its events and fundraisers. I have always been very proud of the generosity of people living in Macarthur. I am continually amazed but not surprised by their willingness to dig deep in order to help local families who are doing it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation is a great asset to our community and has given support, hope and strength to many families in Macarthur. I would like to congratulate the foundation on its achievements and thank the local residents for continuing to support it. Everyone involved is making this world a better place for our children and that is something I believe we should all aspire to.
