        I take the opportunity today to mark the recent death of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Carole Taylor
        </a>
        , a long-time and highly respected Labor branch member in my electorate of Lingiari. Carole passed away peacefully earlier this month in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        ' palliative care unit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Carole came to Alice Springs from her home in Victoria. Carole was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Drug and Alcohol Services Australia from 2014 to 2022. A lifelong true believer, Carole was a fierce advocate for reducing the devastation from drugs, alcohol and other addiction problems, and their impacts on people's lives and in the community. Carole made sure that no-one was left behind and that the most vulnerable people received the care they deserved. It was often said: 'If you come into Alice Springs looking for Carole Taylor, just look for the person doing the toughest job.' Carole was always ready for a challenge, and she was a special person who gave freely of herself without question and throughout her life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Carole spent many years working for the Hawke and Keating governments, most notably in the office of then minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Staples" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Staples
        </a>
        . She was widely admired by her peers for her ability and skills. Carole worked hard as the senior private secretary, negotiating with cabinet ministers to loosen their grip on their funding for achieving better policy and program outcomesâ€”especially in aged care and particularly for regional and remote areas of

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Queensland. She was a committed champion for improving the lives of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Carole hated flying in small planes but regularly made trips throughout remote northern Australia to make sure ministers and staff saw firsthand the conditions under which people were living. She was the flag-bearer for social justice issues and a great fighter for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Her life was one of commitment and service. She made a real difference to the lives of so many, and she had a deep love for and compassion to leave something of lasting value for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is how Carole lived her life right to the very end. She'll be missed. My condolences go to her extended family and to her many friends. I particularly mention the former member for Lingiari,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Snowdon" rel="nofollow">

        , who was a very close friend. And I was lucky enough to know her. Farewell, Carole Taylor; your legacy will always shine bright.
