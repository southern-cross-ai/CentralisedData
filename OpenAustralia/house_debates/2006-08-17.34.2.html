       <p>
        Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to speak briefly about the 40th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        and Vietnam Vietnams Day, which will be marked tomorrow. As members know, there will be a reception in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        this evening to pay tribute to the hundreds of Vietnam veterans who have come to Canberra to mark this event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me start by acknowledging and, on behalf of the House, honouring and paying tribute to the member for Cowan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Edwards" rel="nofollow">
         Graham Edwards
        </a>
        , who served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        from 1968 to 1971 as a member of the Pioneer Platoon, 7th Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        . He is, in my understanding, the only currently serving member of the parliament who served in Vietnam. He paid a terrible price for his service—he lost both legs in a landmine blast. Following his discharge from the Army, he spent many years—and he continues to do so—assisting veterans. On behalf of my colleagues and I know all members of the House, we acknowledge his contribution and we honour his service and his bravery.

        </p>
        <p>
         Tomorrow is the 40th anniversary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Long Tan
         </a>
         . That battle, which was the first major engagement in which Australia was involved in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         , has come to symbolise the bravery and the struggle faced by our Vietnam veterans. It is fitting that the anniversary of that battle is also
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam Veterans
         </a>
         Day. On the afternoon of 18 August 1966,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Company" rel="nofollow">
          Delta Company
         </a>
         6RAR, which was a force of 108 men, patrolling in the area of the Long Tan rubber plantation, encountered an enemy force estimated at some 2,500. A very fierce battle ensued, as a result of which 18 Australians lost their lives and a further 24 were wounded. Some 245 Vietcong combatants were found and other enemy casualties were carried away in the retreat.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the time of the Vietnam War, some 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam. More than 500 died and about 3,000 were wounded. It should be said on this occasion that the Vietnam War caused considerable domestic political controversy. It is not my intention in any way to revisit the internal debate. I respect the fact that there were very strongly held views on both sides of politics on that matter. Any discussion of Vietnam reminds us of those divisions. I think we accept that people held their views with tenacity and with conviction, but it does have to be said that whatever views were held on the rightness or justice of Australia’s involvement in Vietnam—and the remarks I am about to make do not seek to distinguish between those who opposed and those who supported our involvement—an objective assessment would reveal our nation’s collective failure at the time to adequately honour the service of those who went to Vietnam.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sad fact is that those who served in Vietnam were not welcomed back as they should have been. Whatever our views may have been—and I include those who supported the war as well as those who opposed it—the nation collectively failed those men. They are owed our apologies and our regrets for that failure. The very least that we can do on this 40th anniversary is to acknowledge that fact, to acknowledge the difficulties that so many of them have had in coping with the postwar trauma and to acknowledge the magnificent contribution that they have continued to make to our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         So this afternoon and tomorrow we will in different ways—and I know in a totally bipartisan fashion—pay proper regard to their bravery, their service and their commitment. They did what their country lawfully asked them to do at the time. They did it with distinction, with honour and with bravery, and they should have been more properly honoured for that some 40 years ago. I hope with the passage of time they will understand the goodwill of the current generation of Australians in relation to that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are just two other things that I do wish to mention. One of them relates to the issue of the bravery awards that came out of the Battle of Long Tan. They have become the subject of much debate. It does appear, on the assessment of many, that some injustice was done in relation to the changes that were made in the theatre of war to the original recommendations made by the commanding officers during that battle. It has been put strongly to the government—as I understand, it was put strongly to the former government—that a case exists for reopening the changes that were made between the honours recommended by the commanders in the field and the honours recommended by the ultimate commander of the Australian operations in Vietnam.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do understand fully the sense of grievance and the sense of injustice that many of these men feel, and I had the opportunity this morning to spend an hour with Colonel Harry Smith and a number of his colleagues. Colonel Smith, of course, was the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Commanding Officer
         </a>
         of Delta Company 6RAR in the Battle of Long Tan. The difficulty faced by any government in reopening a particular set of recommendations, having regard to changes that might have been made on the original recommendations, is that as one sense of grievance might be addressed so many others are opened up. It is my understanding, and the understanding of many that have examined this issue, that it has frequently been the practice that changes are made on the original recommendations when the recommendations are received by the commanders further up the chain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst I will continue to engage with representatives of the Vietnam veterans community, and most particularly those who were involved in the Battle of Long Tan, as will the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, I would like to frankly explain to the House the difficulty of opening up in the manner requested this particular set of recommendations without also legitimately opening up others, indeed in relation to battles stretching back to World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         and in respect of relatives from battles stretching back to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
          World War I
         </a>
         and similar situations. That is the difficulty the government faces.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I would like to say to the House that, as a further recognition, the government has decided, as a living memorial to the Battle of Long Tan, to rename the Australian Defence Force Leadership and Team Work Awards for secondary schools to the Defence Long Tan Leadership and Team Work Prize, which is a particular recognition of the place that that battle holds—generally in a representative way—in the minds and the hearts of all Australians. I say to our Vietnam veterans that we honour everything you did. You deserve the respect and the affection of a grateful nation. We regret the inadequacies of the past, and we hope that the extension of the hand of friendship and honour by today’s Australians will be of comfort and value to all of you.

         <p>
          On indulgence, I acknowledge the statements made by the Prime Minister and in particular his statement that he will keep in dialogue with the veterans community in relation to the issues about the awards associated with the Long Tan battle that came to light when documents were released in 1996. I do hope that he and his minister can bring those discussions to a satisfactory conclusion from the veterans’ point of view.
         </p>
         <p>
          I wanted today to have a couple of speakers on this matter. Time pressures make that difficult. Therefore I wished to ask our member for Cowan to speak on behalf of the opposition. He, however, said he thinks I ought to speak on behalf of the opposition as the leader of the party. Therefore I will meet things halfway. I will take advantage of your indulgence and read a letter that the member for Cowan wrote to me, and that will suffice for my remarks. I will say no more. He wrote:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I have just been advised that the Prime Minister will only allow one speaker on this important statement before the house today.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I thank you for the opportunity to be our speaker but I believe that our recognition of the service, sacrifice and suffering of Vietnam veterans should rightly come from you, as our Leader.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I would however be pleased if you could perhaps consider just a couple of things.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I noted that at the Launch of the book
          <i>
           Vietnam Our War—Our Peace

          the Minister for

          </a>

           Vietnam Veterans
          </a>
          for the actions of all who opposed the war.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Kim, many good Australians opposed that war and not all who opposed the war took it out on the troops. My father for instance strongly opposed the war. I remember too that Senator John Wheeldon, a former Labor Minister for Repatriation, was a bitter opponent of the war but he was incredibly compassionate toward the individual veterans and strongly supportive of their needs.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Equally it should be said that not all who supported the war supported the troops, and even to this day many Vietnam Veterans refuse to join the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
           RSL
          </a>
          because of the treatment they received on their return home.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Had I the opportunity to speak today I would have taken the time to publicly forgive the person from my mother’s church in Scarborough who wrote an anonymous letter to my mother saying she hoped I died as a result of my wounds, as I was a killer.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I could not have found it in my heart to say those words a few years ago but it is time to move on.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Kim today is not a day to enter into the divisive issues surrounding Australia’s involvement in that war.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Today is a day when our Federal Parliament should honour our Vietnam Veterans, recognise their service and say to them that they did a good job in the best tradition of the Anzacs.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is also a time when we should remember the sacrifice of those who did not come home at all.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is a day when we should remember the Regulars and the

          </a>

         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          To say to them, our veterans, that we understand the difficulties of those who suffer

           Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

          and that we recognise and respect the love and loyalty of the families of veterans, particularly the wives, the partners and the children.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Today is a day when we should say we are proud of our Vietnam veterans. A day when we honour and recognise their sacrifice, their service and their suffering.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I think it is also a time to reflect on the horror of war, the lasting trauma of those involved and the terror and suffering of innocent civilians caught in the devastation of war.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I just also want to thank you for your support in Government of the Welcome Home Parade. I know there are many veterans in Australia who would not have made it to that incredibly warm and emotional parade if you had not pitched in to ensure the support of defence and other government agencies to get them there and home again.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Kim, can I just say those who served Vietnam either on the ground, in the air or on the waters served as a team.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We would enhance our support today if once again we could become a team and work together to support each other.

          Kim I said earlier that it is time to move on.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Last night I had dinner with the Vietnamese Ambassador. As we left the table he said to me that both our countries must look to the future.

          I agree. I would wish him and his children, indeed all the children of the world that which was most elusive during the last century—peace.

          In closing Kim I want to say I am proud to have served my nation and proud of all who served with me.
