       <p>
        In the last six years, 1.4 million jobs have been created in Australia, predominantly in the private sector, and that's an increase of some 12.6 per cent, which is fantastic for Australians. In my electorate of Petrie jobs have always been one of the top issues for locals. It's important to the local community that we have jobs locally available, close to home and close to where they work, so they don't have to travel as far. Being a former small business owner myself, I know the value of local employment and the benefits it has for families. I originally came up with the concept of a jobseeker boot camp in my electorate based on my experience of hiring people. When I hire people, what is it that I look for?
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst out campaigning back in 2012 I recognised a real need to bring together job provider agencies, employers and potential employees under the one roof and so I now host these regular jobseeker boot camps. Last week's jobseeker boot camp was one of the biggest on record with more than 150 unemployed attendees on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP" rel="nofollow">
         RSVP
        </a>
        list. There were plenty of guest speakers from industries like recycled timber business, an Israeli restaurant, a kitchen manufacturer in my electorate, a hairdresser and Dolphin sporting club, which is the second-biggest employer after the hospital on the peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        These boot camps offer great opportunities for jobseekers to hear firsthand from employers about what they look for when hiring. Last year we had an employer attend the session with three jobs available. He was pleased to let me know, following the boot camp, that he actually recruited one of the people who spoke to him on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year's event featured a number of key speakers, and I also had the

        there. There are many opportunities for people within the Australian Defence Force for good paid work and study.

        employment agency came onboard to sponsor this year's event, and I want to thank them for it. It definitely was the best jobseeker boot camp to date. They provided morning tea for 150 people. The venue at Market Square Deception Bay was brilliant. In the past, I've had other job search providers helping me, but thank you to APM employment.

        from Kennedy's Timbers has also told me that this week they've interviewed four jobseekers, and one long-term unemployed person will start a paid trial next week at the business. They're confident that they will be able to fill three positions and two apprenticeships. That is great news for locals.
