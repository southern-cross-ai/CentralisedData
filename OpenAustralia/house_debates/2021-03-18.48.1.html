        The Morrison government's thrown a shroud of secrecy over the JobKeeper program, but a new report finds that half of the public companies that got JobKeeper saw their earnings go up, not down. One-fifth of the JobKeeper dollars went to firms that were more profitable than before the pandemic. This is waste on a colossal scale. The report suggests that $10 billion to $20 billion in JobKeeper payments may have gone to firms with rising profitsâ€”firms that never needed it, firms that gave it to billionaire shareholders and millionaire

        , Australia could keep the program going. Racehorse and yacht sales might go down, but that $10 billion to $20 billion in wasted JobKeeper payments would sustain the program for another six months.

        like to talk about small government, but they've presided over the biggest blowout in corporate welfare in Australia's history. We're talking about hundreds of dollars for every single person in Australia. This is money raised from the taxes of hardworking Australians. Never before has so much been given by so many to so few.
