       <p>
        by leave—I am very pleased to deliver the Regional Budget Statement on behalf of the government. I acknowledge the traditional owners of the lands on which we meet—the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples—as well as the Wadawurrung and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dja_Dja_Wurrung" rel="nofollow">
         Dja Dja Wurrung
        </a>
        people—the traditional owners of the lands that I represent—and I pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like almost 30 per cent of Australians, regional Australia is where I call home. I have represented the regional electorate of Ballarat for over 20 years and I have seen massive change in that region and across all of our regions over that period.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget delivers on our election commitments and provides funds for the government's purposeful and targeted approach to investing in regional Australia. It contains more than 760 initiatives which the government is delivering to boost regional communities and our industries. It is the first step along the path to create new, sustainable and transparent pathways for funding in regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is about high-quality investments in the right places and with the right priorities. It is driven by our determination to deliver on our election commitments and ensure that our policies and our expenditure are focused on productive investments, and that they are fairly delivered across all of regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a budget centred on the role the regions play in our nation's economic growth. Regions that are as diverse as the people who call them home—and no more is that represented than in this place. It is an approach that supports sustainable growth, helping regional communities achieve their potential. An approach that is driven by communities and lets communities in on the decision-making process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Built on a foundation of transparency and integrity—and focused on creating jobs, building resilience and unlocking economic growth—the investment we have outlined will support the government's ambition of 'no-one held back and no-one left behind'.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures range across all areas of government responsibility, from infrastructure to health, from energy to education, from social services to tourism, from digital connectivity to defence and from net zero to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        communities. This is a budget that responsibly faces up to the pressures facing the global and Australian economies, but sets Australia's regions up for a strong future and to play their continued significant role in the economy of the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we sit here today, the statistics for regional Australia tell a good story. Australia's regions are home to one in three Australians. Between June 2020 and June 2021, the population in regional Australia grew by one per cent, or just over 80,000 people. Over the five years to June 2021, regional coastal areas grew by an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent, regional cities by one per cent and inland country by 0.6 per cent. In the year to July 2022, regionally based industries including agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining made up an extraordinary 72 per cent of the value of Australia's merchandise exports.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Australia
        </a>
        is a great place to live, it is a great place to raise a family, and we always punch above our weight. I know that firsthand, as do so many in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Election commitments
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget makes substantial investment in our regions. It's providing $9.6 billion to deliver our infrastructure election commitments with transparency and integrity. This includes the delivery of significant priority investments like the Cairns Marine Precinct, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Arm" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Arm
        </a>
        precinct in Darwin, logistics hubs in north and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Central Australia
        </a>
        , enabling infrastructure in the Pilbara and our transformational Central Australia plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're making the regions stronger through a streamlined and retargeted investment in a nationally significant infrastructure pipeline. We're starting work on nation-building infrastructure by investing $500 million for the corridor acquisition, planning and early works of a Sydney to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        and Newcastle high-speed rail project following the introduction of legislation to establish the High Speed Rail Authority. We're delivering safer roads to Tasmanians by investing $540 million to upgrade the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Highway
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Tasman Highway
        </a>
        and the East and West Tamar Highways.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're building stronger and more resilient freight connections across our vast country with a new $1.5 billion Freight Highway Upgrade Program, focused on key freight routes in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . And $7.7 million to develop common-user infrastructure at the port of Bundaberg in Queensland to support industry diversification. We're investing $332 million towards the Northern Territory Strategic Roads Package, upgrading the roads that remote communities depend on, like the Santa Teresa Road and the Mereenie Loop. And we're investing $40 million to upgrade the jetties, wharfs and barges that underpin life up in the Torres.
       </p>
       <p>
        They're just a few of the investments that we've made across my portfolio.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional g rants
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only does this budget deliver now, but it sets new structures for regional funding well into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm not going to go into the way in which the previous government went about funding decisions today—there are other forums for that—but all regional Australians need to have confidence in regional grants processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget does replace the Building Better Regions Fund with $1 billion over three years for two new programs targeted at regional and rural areas. Community groups and local government will be invited to seek support from the Growing Regions Program which will support infrastructure that enhances liveability and supports prosperity, funding projects like arts and cultural centres, sports facilities, libraries and airport upgrades.And through the Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program, the government will work with states and local councils in a nationally consistent way to invest in those larger scale place-based projects aimed at transforming regional and rural centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        These funds will help drive regional economic prosperity by providing equitable and fair access to funding for capital works for community and economic infrastructure across our nation, across our regions, rural and remote, and all of our areas across Australia. We know that regional grants programs like this are important.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many projects that deliver benefits to communities are beyond the scope of constrained regional council and community group budgets. And to ensure local communities have a say in the future of their own communities, we are delivering ongoing support for the Regional Development Australia network that we established when last in government, and we want it to play a significant role in place based decision-making. Located in 53 regions,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
         RDA
        </a>
        s bring together all levels of government, providing local information that supports effective policy development and the delivery of projects that align with regional strategies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, our commitment to a much stronger partnership with local government will support our ability to listen and respond to the needs of regional Australia, including by partnering with them to provide an additional $250 million—on top of what was promised by the previous government—through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, particularly to upgrade regional and remote and peri-urban roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        Communications
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time as building the transport and community infrastructure regional Australians need, we're investing, through Minister Rowland's portfolio, in communications infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over recent years we've seen just how important high-speed internet connectivity is. We've all joined Zoom meetings, we've worked from home and many of us have shifted our lives from the cities to the regions. Digital connectivity is one of the foundations for regional growth in our modern world. But too many regions have been left behind. That is why the Australian government will provide $2.4 billion in equity funding to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        Co to provide around 90 per cent of the NBN fixed-line footprint with access to gigabit broadband speeds by 2025. As part of this initiative, NBN Co will provide access to full fibre upgrades to approximately 1.5 million additional fibre-to-the-node premises around Australia. Importantly, over 660,000 of these premises are expected to be located in regional areas, allowing more workers and more small businesses to base themselves in regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time as building on our proud legacy of the NBN, this budget delivers our Better Connectivity for Rural and Regional Australia plan; a five-year plan, a $656 million package that will significantly improve mobile coverage in rural and remote communities that are currently underserved. It delivers also $30 million over three years from 2022-23 to 2024-25 for the on-farm connectivity program, enabling farmers to extend connectivity in their fields and to take advantage of the connected machinery and sensor technology we know many are using now.
       </p>
       <p>
        So that we can find out exactly where mobile black spots are, we're also investing $20 million in an independent national audit of mobile coverage to establish an evidence-based guideline. We know telecommunications companies, many in our regional communities, tell us there is coverage but we all know that is simply not true when we actually go to use our phones in regional communities. This will provide an evidence baseline to guide future priorities. The core of this audit will be delivered utilising the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        transport fleet to ensure all corners of our nation are actually reached.
       </p>
       <p>
        Net Zero
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as we're investing in the future of regional Australia with our communications and infrastructure investments, we're also securing the future on the pathway to net zero. We will deliver job-creating emissions cutting and price-reducing commitments through Rewiring the Nation, the National Energy Transformation Partnership and the $1.9 billion powering the regions fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Up to $3 billion from the National Reconstruction Fund will provide support to ensure that regional Australia can harness the economic opportunities of decarbonisation, including green hydrogen and clean energy manufacturing. Our net zero task force will bring together perspectives from communities, state and territory governments and industries and unions to advise the government on ensuring regional Australians are first to benefit from Australia's transformation to a renewable energy superpower.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're investing in the fuels of the future, including green hydrogen, with $100 million to support the port of Newcastle and the Hunter region becoming hydrogen ready, and $71.9 million for the Townsville hydrogen hub as part of more than half a billion dollars for regional hydrogen hubs in places like Tasmania, Gladstone and the Pilbara.
       </p>
       <p>
        Resources and Manufacturing
       </p>
       <p>
        My home town was built on mining and with that came manufacturing, as is the case with so many regional centres. Our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund will support other communities to do the same, helping expand and transform Australia's industry and economy to secure future prosperity with a focus on value adding in resources, agriculture, transport, medical science and defence capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The $50.5 million Australian critical minerals research and development hub and $100 million Critical Minerals Development Program will further advance and modernise these sectors while local industry grants will support specific projects across the country from Hobart to Ipswich.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will build more trains, here in Australia with our national rail manufacturing plan, supporting proud manufacturing communities from Ballarat and Bendigo in Victoria to Maryborough up north. To train the workers needed, we establish Jobs and Skills Australia to precisely map and anticipate skills shortages, as well as delivering 480,000 fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        vocational education places in key areas across the economy, and providing $22.6 million for 29,000 additional in-training support places for apprentices in regional, rural and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget also makes critical investments in agriculture to protect and grow Australia's agricultural industry, our fisheries and our forestry sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investing more money in our biosecurity system is critical, delivering on our election commitment to back the forestry industry and even beginning the work of planning for the next big dry with more than $20 million allocated for drought preparedness—it might not feel like it right at the moment but it will come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Environment
       </p>
       <p>
        While we create jobs in agriculture, resources and manufacturing—we will protect our environment and natural heritage with investments totalling $1.2 billion by 2030 to protect the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        and $233.4 million in Kakadu and other national parks. These generate huge tourism jobs in our regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        We understand that water is a lifeline for regional communities across the country, which is why we are delivering on our election commitments to restore and protect rivers and streams across the country, as well as continuing investments in our most important and critical river system—the Murray-Darling Basin—and investing in dams that stack up across the country through the National Water Grid Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, we well understand the threat that flooding and disasters pose—our thoughts remain with those in crisis now. The volunteers, council workers, emergency personnel and community on the ground are doing incredible work day and night, preparing and cleaning up. And we know that they are exhausted.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have already seen the new National Emergency Management Agency in action, working collaboratively and quickly with all levels of government and communities to identify and design appropriate and effective mechanisms for response, recovery and long-term strategies so communities are better positioned to respond to future disasters.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, more importantly, to deal with and prepare for the disasters of the future, this budget establishes the Disaster Ready Fund, investing up to $200 million per year, matched by states and territories where possible, on disaster risk reduction, resilience and mitigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        found that every dollar spent reducing disaster risk saves between $2 and $11 in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. We have got to do better here.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government also commits $38.3 million over four years from 2022-23 for Disaster Relief Australia to upscale their organisational capacity and operations, providing a significant increase of 5,200 additional volunteers to their existing disaster volunteer workforce by covering the uplift costs associated with recruitment, deployment, equipment and training. When they are needed, these volunteers will be there.
       </p>
       <p>
        We make this broad range of investments because regional Australia is so diverse. When we have heard regional Australia spoken of in the past there has been a tendency to pretend that the only thing that matters to us is infrastructure investment and grants spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        But regional development and regional Australians deserve so much more than that. We need and deserve access to government support and strong, reliable services that those in the cities can take for granted. We need affordable housing—which will be added to through our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund and Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. And we need stronger education—giving Regional Australians priority access to 20,000 extra Commonwealth supported places at university and $158.5 million worth of measures to address teacher shortages across our regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Good regional development isn't just about investing in roads or industries—it is of course that—but it is also about investing in our people through skills and training. It's about investing in our services like Medicare, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        and child care, enabling regional Australians full participation in economic and social life.
       </p>
       <p>
        After nine years of cuts and neglect, Medicare is in its worst state ever, and that's why we are investing in urgent care clinics, supporting regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, putting nurses in aged-care homes and investing $185.3 million to attract, support and retain more health professionals into regional and rural communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        And good regional development is about supporting our veterans through housing, services and work. Importantly, it's about investing in the future of First Nations communities and righting the wrongs of the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why we are committed to enshrining a voice for First Nations people in our Constitution and further boosting efforts on closing the gap between the experience of Indigenous and non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        , including in our regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a budget that supports Indigenous Australians and the environment through a $636.4 million expansion of the Indigenous Rangers program; $100 million to upgrade housing in First Nations homelands; as well as support for jobs, health care and education in First Nations communities across regional and remote Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work of reconciliation is, of course, unfinished, but this budget commits to advancing that cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        Our approach to developing Australia's regions, supported by the investments we are making through this budget, will harness the wealth of the diverse communities that make up regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are investing in our regions' people, the places we live in, the services we rely on and the industries that help our economies grow.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committed to ensuring regional Australia is at the centre of our nation's growth and at the forefront of our agenda, delivering a better future for all of Australia and leaving none of us behind.

         Australia's regions, home to one in three Australians, are absolutely crucial to our strength and success as a nation. We know that regional Australia punches above its weight. Around two-thirds of Australia's exports earnings come from regional industries such as mining, agriculture, tourism, retail services and manufacturing. But it's not just an economic sense that underpins its importance; our regions are integral to our values and identity as a country.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that, while it's immensely rewarding living in the bush, it comes with some major and unique challenges. It's crucial that the millions of men, women and children of regional, rural and remote Australia and the communities they live in have a voice in their federal government. They deserve a voice—a voice with influence, a voice that matters. When we were in government, the federal coalition was immensely proud to give regional Australia that voice. We understood the challenges regional people face every day. In contrast to those opposite, those of us in the coalition overwhelmingly represent the regions in this parliament. We live, breath and experience these challenges, and, as a government, we took decisive action. In government, we looked at ways to harness and turbocharge the incredible potential, talent and opportunities that the regions offer to our nation. Our track record in investing and building critical infrastructure speaks for itself, especially in the regions, with record investments across Australia supporting around 40,000 jobs. These commitments remain our vision for regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our March 2022 budget, we increased the federal infrastructure investment pipeline to $122 billion, to create new jobs, to keep people and freight moving and to drive economic growth. The coalition's last budget also announced an additional $17.9 billion to road, rail and community infrastructure projects across regional Australia. This proud legacy and record of achievement and investment is in stark contrast to this Labor government, which, sadly, has been epitomised in this federal budget, which has swung the financial axe to dedicated funding for regional Australia that we, as a coalition, fought so hard for.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the election on 21 May, it hasn't taken long for this Labor government to show its true colours and character. It's less than 160 days since Labor was elected, and already this government has enforced measures that will make life harder for the millions of Australians who live outside our capital cities. During the election, we saw the warning signs. In a deliberate blow to our farmers and the whole agricultural supply chain, they pledged to scrap the agricultural visa, a reform that the coalition delivered as part of our plan to address the massive and acute workforce shortages in the regions. They also promised to shut down the live sheep export trade, which employs 3,000

         ns.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once in office, those opposite went even further. We know that access to adequate health care and a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         is an enormous struggle in rural, regional and remote Australia. In July, this government chose to rip up the Distribution Priority Area classification system for overseas trained doctors, which, as a direct consequence, will rip doctors from our regional, rural and remote communities. This means the residents of Mitchell, a small rural community in western Queensland, that's desperate for a GP will now be forced to compete over the same pool of doctors as Brookfield in Brisbane. All across regional Australia, we're already seeing these consequences. There's a real human toll to this.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, in a further blow to the bush, by handing down this budget, this government has cut billions of dollars in dedicated regional infrastructure funding. This funding was going into supporting transformational community-building projects, which would have made a real difference on the ground to our regions. This government has broken the hearts of regional and rural families in this perverse budget. The Prime Minister promised, if he won government, there would be no-one held back and no-one left behind. But in Labor's first budget 30 per cent of Australians from regional and rural Australia have been betrayed. This is a horror budget for everyone who lives, works and invests in the regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal coalition firmly opposes and condemns this government for ripping multibillion-dollar funds out of rural, remote and regional Australia. The coalition's worst fears have been realised. These everyday Australians, our hardworking regional and rural families and businesses, have been unapologetically forgotten by Labor. Whether it's infrastructure, agriculture, water, the availability of child care, or the cost of living, through this budget the government has turned its back on regional and rural families and workers. It has abandoned them.
        </p>
        <p>
         A major test last night in this federal budget was for the government to build on the strong position it inherited from the coalition to address the cost-of-living crisis bearing down on Australians. Labor has failed this test, and this budget does nothing to assist the family budget. There is no credible plan to deal with the source of inflation or to help families deal with immediate cost-of-living pressures. This budget confirms that the cost of living is going up. Electricity and gas bills are going up. Tax payments are going up. Employment will go down, and real wages are forecast to go down. This is a high-taxing and high-spending budget that does nothing to help Australian families get ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our regional communities, these cost-of-living pressures will bite especially hard. The drastic increases in grocery bills were man-made, by the government, and this budget would make the average family worse off by at least $2,000 by Christmas. Groceries are already eight per cent higher, not just because of natural disasters but also because of a Labor-made disaster, in scrapping the dedicated agriculture visa. Supply has been slashed because farmers and processors are only working at around 60 per cent capacity, which has put prices up at the check-out. Retail electricity prices are already up 20 per cent this year and predicted to increase by a further 30 per cent next year, while the $275 reduction in electricity bills promised by the Labor government during the federal election is now all but gone. Interest rates have already gone up and are predicted to go up a further 75 basis points under this government, which is ripping hundreds of dollars out of households each month. Every time Australians get their grocery receipt, their power bill or their mortgage statement, they should see this federal government's face in it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal coalition recognises that the cost of child care is a major issue. That's why, in government, our childcare subsidy policy was targeted towards families on low and middle incomes, with around 90 per cent of families eligible for a subsidy between 50 and 85 per cent. We made further changes in March this year by introducing a higher subsidy, up to 95 per cent, for families with multiple children in care, which was estimated to save a family an average of $2,260 per year. In fact, our targeted extra support, introduced in March, made a real difference, because childcare costs came down 4.6 per cent in the year to June 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although this budget makes a lot of noise about the cost of child care, there is dead silence on any measures to actually improve frontline availability and accessibility of childcare services in regional, rural and remote Australia. In this budget, Labor have turned their backs on the mums and dads desperate to find regional and rural childcare places. Last week I visited childcare centres in Kempsey and

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , and the waiting lists there are staggering—about 200 children. It's extremely concerning that the government has announced $4.7 billion on cheaper childcare fees for city families, while refusing to spend even one dollar on delivering more childcare places in regional communities. A recent comprehensive study, by Victoria University's Mitchell institute, found that nine million Australians live in an area defined as a 'childcare desert', with at least three children competing over each available childcare place.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Regional Australia
         </a>
         was among the worst impacted, and it's a damning reality that 75 per cent of people living in rural, regional and remote Australia live in a childcare desert.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in this budget, there's no plan to improve access to child care, there's no plan to address these childcare deserts and there's no plan to address the workforce shortages that are crippling this sector. The questions that regional Australia is entitled to ask are: Where are the additional places going to open up for all the new children entering the system? What's point of having lower out-of-pocket costs if you can't even get your child into care? Regional and rural families have every right to feel let down, to feel disappointed. Unlike those opposite, the federal coalition delivered measures to improve childcare availability in regions. In our budget in March 2022, we provided $19.4 million to support the establishment of 20 new childcare centres where there is limited or no child care, which took our total investment to $432.5 million over the next four years through our Community Child Care Fund. This year the fund was supporting 824 services, of which 403 services are in regional and remote Australia, receiving 65 per cent of the total funding.

        <p>
         In this budget, multibillion dollar programs announced by the coalition have been scrapped, including the $7.1 billion

         , the Pilbara in WA and the Hunter in New South Wales. The $2 billion Regional Accelerator Program—which was poised to provide communities with funding opportunities targeted to local priorities in infrastructure, manufacturing and industry development, skills and training, research and development, and education—and round 6 of the Building Better Regions Fund, worth $250 million, has all been ripped up, which has scrapped 815 projects around Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal budget takes more than $5 billion out of water projects by not proceeding with the Hells Gate Dam project in Queensland and deferring funding for the Urannah Dam, Dungowan Dam pipeline, Emu Swamp Dam pipeline, Hughenden Irrigation Scheme and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyangala_Dam" rel="nofollow">
          Wyangala Dam

         wall-raising project. We need dams to mitigate flooding in the future, grow our regional areas and continue to grow our economy. These cuts to water programs are devastating and will impact regional areas. If you take away water infrastructure, you take away the future of regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, the government is refusing to tell regional Australians the cost of delivering their commitments. According to the budget papers, the costs to the Department of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         , Energy, the Environment and Water and the Department of Treasury for delivering water commitments are not for publication. The government should be open and transparent with the Australian public and basin communities. What are their plans for the basin, and how much is it going to cost? This plan is also under threat, with the safety net of 450 gigalitres less about outcomes and more about numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal coalition is immensely proud of our achievements in agriculture during our term in government. By the time we went to the federal election earlier this year, we were investing over $1.7 billion into Australian agriculture. As a government, we supported agriculture, fisheries and forestry production to reach a record $87 billion in 2021-22. In this year's budget, Labor are claiming that they committed a billion dollars. It'd be good to see the numbers, but it's essentially a continuation of what we committed—nothing new, no vision, no plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         We had an Ag2030 plan, with seven key themes, including stronger trade and export; protection against pests and disease; building productivity and a better environment; stronger local manufacturing and supply chains; stronger and more resilient infrastructure; and helping our farmers and fishers secure their future. We worked in partnership with the industry to get through droughts, bushfires, floods and COVID-19. Now this government needs to work in partnership with industry to assist them with the cost of living. A 50 per cent increase in energy prices is not good for an agricultural business, a dairy farmer, a meatworks or the horticultural sector. A 40c increase in fuel is no good for farming. What's their vision? Cuts to trade and exports, cuts to local manufacturing and supply chains and cuts to infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         The cuts to the $2 billion Regional Accelerator Program and $7.1 billion Energy Security and Regional Development Plan are going to hurt agriculture and regional Australia. This was the very industry that assisted all of Australia to get through COVID-19 and contributed to the windfall in the budget—building supply chain resilience and investing in agricultural imports and manufacturing. It is all gone. This government has spruced $500 million from the National Reconstruction Fund to support local sovereignty but will not provide loans or equity until mid-next year. Fertiliser input prices and supply chain issues need to be addressed now. The Export Market Development Grants for industry has also gone. With no agricultural visa, and not helping farmers and fishers secure their future, where are all our workers going to come from?

         2022, to address critical workforce shortages in the agricultural sector, the federal coalition was proud to announce the introduction of the ag visa. This was a huge piece of reform that would help alleviate workforce pressure for our farmers. Built on a bilateral agreement that we secured with Vietnam, the ag visa had a minimum age of 21 and provided a pathway to permanent residency. Under the ag visa, employees would be recruited to work across a range of agricultural sectors, including horticulture, dairy, wool, grains, fisheries and forestry as well as support services and primary processing. Importantly, this program provided flexibility for workers to move between approved employers without compromising workforce standards and undermining worker protections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the severe workforce shortages in the agricultural sector, the government's decision to tear up this visa is unconscionable. This move makes it so much harder for farmers to find workers. Right now, Australia needs 172,000 workers to get product from the paddock to the plate. The government's Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme will be able to provide 42,000 workers at best. Labor must deliver practical solutions for our farmers, their families and Australian consumers. Now they're even changing the settings. As the

         Already, election commitments have been cut at the expense of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Under the coalition, the Pacific, Timor-Leste and South-East Asia were prioritised within our overseas development assistance budget. Travelling across regional Australia, visiting agricultural communities and speaking directly with locals—from the fruit and veggie growers in the Gascoyne to the beef producers in Central Queensland and the farmers in Mildura—I've seen and heard firsthand what a tremendous difference the ag visa would have made to the businesses and livelihoods of regional Australians.

         The coalition supports improving the environment and started the world's first Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Package, with an investment of over $90 million. There was the $5 billion Future Drought Fund, $214.9 million for soils and the $1.1 billion National Landcare Program. This government have indicated they'll protect the environment, including 4.8 million hectares of additional protected areas. Tasmania is 6.8 million hectares. Where is this going to come from, and how will it be done? It's another measure creating uncertainty in investing in agriculture in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         This budget also includes $80.7 million to support voluntary action by farmers to lower methane emissions. This plan doesn't stack up. The plan will force farmers to buy more expensive food for their cattle and make farming more expensive. The result will be an increase in meat prices, which will push up food bills for families across the country. In government, the coalition took a practical step towards helping reduce methane emissions in the resources and agricultural sectors. We didn't sign up to the Global Methane Pledge, which calls for a 30 per cent global reduction in methane emissions on 2020 levels by 2030. Signing the pledge goes against the agriculture sector's desire to grow to $100 billion by 2030. At a time when Australian families are struggling with the cost of energy and mortgage payments, this has the potential to push up food prices even further.

         We owe so much to our veterans. It appears that wellbeing centres to support those who have served our nation are not spared from this government's cuts to the regions. Veteran wellbeing centres, established in partnership with ex-service organisations, local health services or community organisations, help better connect veterans to the extensive support and advocacy already available, with a strong focus on health and wellbeing. A re-elected coalition government would have established 14 new veteran wellbeing centres, at a cost of $70 million. However, this government is funding 10.

         The government has announced $99.8 million for a strategic critical minerals development program to assist critical minerals producers progress strategically significant projects. However, this program has been rebranded and was previously a $200 million critical minerals accelerator program. The program actually only has about $50 million left, after the first $50 million is already out the door, following six grants announced and approved by the coalition in April. In a further sleight of hand, the government has rebranded the Australian critical minerals research and development centre as a hub. They are trying to pretend it's new. While the headline figure of $50.5 million in funding appears the same, the government has hidden further funding cuts by stretching it out over more years to reduce annual funding. This funding cut is a slap in the face to an industry that should be leading the world in critical minerals extraction and exports, as the global demand for batteries and renewable components soars. The hypocrisy is clear. This government is pushing Australia headlong into a rush towards renewables, all while cutting funding to the very critical minerals that are vital—
