        service. Jock joined up in Glasgow at the age of 18, in 1941. He flew Spitfires out of Italy, but he crashed in May 1944 and was taken prisoner until the end of the war. Given his service there and his post-war work, it's pretty amazing that, at the age of 43, having just retired, he joined the RAAF and moved to Australia, serving in Vietnam in No. 35 Squadron, carrying personnel and supplies. He served in many capacities back in Australia, and his contribution deserves this parliament's recognition.

        Richmond became his home, along with his wife, Maureen, and his children, Carol, Anne and Charles. We're very lucky that, in his early 90s, Jock wrote down his story.

        , it's called. It's available online, and I highly recommend it as a superb insight into an incredible man's life. To be able to mark his 100th at Richmond base, with a big contingent of serving air men and women and the local state MP, Robyn Preston, was a real honour. Happy birthday, Jock.
