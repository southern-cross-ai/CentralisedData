        I have a lot of time for the member for Adelaide and I have a lot of time for her concerns for her constituents and the things that she has brought to the table today. However, in Adelaide we have a state government rolling in money and these people will not give money to those who desperately need dental care. This is an important health issue; it is a state issue.

          No. I have been a new member three times. Don’t ever excuse someone for being a new member. Members represent their constituency and the member has done that properly today. However, the petition she brought to the table should go to the

            No, I am passionate about what you said. I understand there are people in distress in our community. We should never forget that even in prosperous times there are those in our community who are missing out. We recognise that. However, when the state has a responsibility it should be dealing with it, and so should the Victorian state government, which is also rolling in money. The members have a responsibility to bring the dental issue to their attention.

            I want to talk about the fires in Moondarra in Gippsland. The response to the fires by the chief executive officer and councillors of the shire of

            was very effective. During the fire, when there was a danger of getting a northerly long front and the south-west winds coming in and blowing the front through, what we decided to do—and I praise the

            and the

            for what they did—was to go into asset protection. Asset protection is about protecting homes. No houses were damaged and people did not have to leave their homes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The response from the Baw Baw shire was fantastic. Their recovery program is going very well. It has provided a great opportunity for the community to come together.

            came down to the area and promoted the businesses that lost money because the tourists stopped coming; they thought the area had been devastated. When the tourists come back to Walhalla there will be an opportunity for all of us to spend our money in our own backyard. This is a great place to visit. Walhalla—with the train, the mine, the people and the corner store—is open for business. I say to those people who are looking for a place to go in Victoria: come to Walhalla. Yes, there has been a fire through there; however, we as a community—
