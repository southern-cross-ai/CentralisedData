        I do not really care how anyone votes—you would be shocked if you knew that, in this country, in this day and age, kickbacks were being paid to union officials as part of agreements with construction companies. But I am updating this chamber that this morning we have had further testimony from former Mirvac employees about a

        head who had his house built using workmen who were paid for by a construction firm, allegedly. That is right. What are the connections and the second secret commissions being paid to have someone have their mansion built near my electorate using tradespeople sent down by a construction group that the union has an engagement with? These secret commissions are illegal under the

        , and we need to get to the bottom of this and not try and kill off a union corruption royal commission. Australians would support these kinds of things being exposed. They belong in qangos at the turn of the last century. They have no place in the 21st century. I learned that near my electorate they are building a 500 square metre home with four bedrooms and bathrooms, three garages and a butler's kitchen. Gee, life is good in the union movement—especially when someone else builds your home for you!

        These allegations needed to be aired. They need to be proven and we need to know the connections with construction firms that are doing these kinds of deals. They are only allegations at the moment, but the royal commission needs to expose them, and this Leader of the Opposition, who continues to try and suppress and neutralise this inquiry, should join every other self-respecting Australian and let the law do its work.
