        This week marks 25 years of National Child Protection Week. It is an important time to raise awareness around the importance of protecting children and giving them a voice. Our government is committed to tackling child abuse and neglect, and every day we are working towards better outcomes through the delivery of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Minister for

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        , for the ambitious framework to focus on protecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people. We have already seen significant achievements such as the release for the national standards for out-of-home care and the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner. But we know there is much more to be done.

       <p>
        One of Australia's most well known child safety advocates is Bravehearts founder and

        </a>
        . Hetty has done tremendous work across Australia to help educate thousands of children on personal safety and to support many children and their families. She has also worked with the government on legislative reform to improve child protection. As part of Child Protection Week, Bravehearts hosts White Balloon Day on 11 September. This year I have signed up as a children's champion to help raise funds and awareness for this important cause. In my electorate of Forde, we have a fantastic Bravehearts team in Beenleigh who go above and beyond to help children and families in our local community. On Friday I will be hosting a White Balloon Day fundraiser at Zarraffa's in Beenleigh. There will be a donation box available for people to come down and make donations. I am very pleased to be able to help raise funds for such an important cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our children need to be protected and given a voice, and Bravehearts is one of the most important organisations in Australia proving that service. I would also like to recognise the Kingston East Neighbourhood Group at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacks_Creek" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for hosting a family fun day today in support of National Child Protection Week. We have many fantastic organisations in our community that provide a wide range of resources and support to our families and children. They say it takes an entire village to raise a child and that notion is very relevant today. The parents, friends, teachers and the various organisations and services that make up our community all offer the support and help we need in raising, protecting and providing for our children. I thank them all for the wonderful work that they do.
