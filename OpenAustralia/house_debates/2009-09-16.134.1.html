        I want to congratulate the people of Rosewood for the inaugural Rosewood Festival, held on 4 September through to 6 September. I also thank them for suffering my

       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to congratulate the Cabanda Aged Care facility for their wonderful contribution to helping those who are aged and frail and disabled in the community. The Rudd government is fulfilling an election commitment in Rosewood by giving to Cabanda Aged Care $1.5 million. I was pleased to be present at the opening of Cabanda Link, which is a link between home and hostel. It is a $1 million facility which was opened by me and also by the

       <p>
        Lorna Kanofski opened Cabanda Link, which will be an important facility for the people of Rosewood. I was in Rosewood that morning as well with Wayne Wendt for a sod turning at Rosewood State Primary School. While I was at Cabanda that afternoon I met Mal Jacobsen, the Design Manager of Paynter Dixon. He said this to me in an email:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As you know, Paynter Dixon Queensland currently has 2 … Projects in Rosewood which are partially funded by the Federal Government …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. redevelopment of Cabanda Aged Care (extension to Aged Care Facility, new Community Building and 9 … Independent Living Units); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. a new Multi-Purpose Hall and Resource Centre at Rosewood State School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some $2.125 million is going to that school. Mal Jacobsen goes on to say this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Cabanda Aged Care Redevelopment
        </b>
        over the 35 week duration of the project we will average around 60 workers on site each day (with over approx. 500 total people gaining some work on this site); and
