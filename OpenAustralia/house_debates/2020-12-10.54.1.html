        An Albanese federal Labor government is a bit like a mirage in the desert. I don't think it's coming any time soon, but, anyway, there you go. There is a percentage of people who still think that a mobile phone is for having a conversation on. In fact, it is the key to so much more. As you and I know, it is the key to mobile technology, to the internet, to the internet of things. But there are some people that are somewhat left behind and haven't actually made that transition yet. So that's why I was very pleased with the announcement this week of the regional tech hub, which is going to be run by

        get fixed wireless? My neighbour gets fixed wireless. Am I on satellite or does the does fibre come down my street?'â€”whatever it is. 'What do I need to do to get a booster on my phone? What kind of phone do I buy to get the best reception?' That's what the tech hub is going to supply for regional people. It will be run by the National Farmers Federation. It will be a great thing.
