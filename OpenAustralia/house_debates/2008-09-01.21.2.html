        My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer explain to the House why he is anticipating a fall in official interest rates when inflation is expected to rise to five per cent over the year to December and unemployment is expected to rise to 4.75 per cent?

           which produced 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberal Party. But we put up our hand and said we would accept responsibility for dealing with it, and dealing with it we are. We are dealing with it through responsible economic management, by building a strong surplus, a $22 billion surplus, that those opposite want to vandalise. We are also dealing with it by attending to the capacity constraints that those opposite ignored for 12 long years, thereby putting further upward pressure on inflation. On top of that, now we have the worst global conditions in over 25 years.
          </p>
          <p>
           All of these things are taken into account by the

            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           , but one thing we did in our budget was that we made room to move. We made room to move for the Reserve Bank. They will take their independent decision tomorrow. But of course, if those opposite had their way, there would be no room to move for the Reserve Bank, because they want to vandalise the surplus. Do they have one single coherent answer to the problem of inflation, to do something about inflation and interest rates? Of course they don’t. There is not one consistent economic policy coming from any of those opposite who pretend to know something about economic policy. I was talking here last week about the ‘

            Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are asking very simple, factual questions. In this case, it was a factual question about official interest rates being likely to fall when inflation is expected to rise to five per cent over the year to December and unemployment is projected to rise. I ask you to bring the Treasurer back to the question that was asked.

              I am dealing with inflation, I am dealing with interest rates and I am dealing with employment. The Leader of the Opposition was asked at the doors today whether, as Prime Minister, he would instruct the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
               Reserve Bank
              </a>
              governor to do what he had just advocated a couple of minutes earlier. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said at the doors in answer to the question, ‘If Prime Minister, does that mean you will tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements?’ He answered, ‘No.’ He admitted that his policy in opposition is too irresponsible to be put in place in government. That is how irresponsible this Leader of the Opposition is.

                  Certainly, Mr Speaker, and because it was a question about who was responsible for interest-rate movements, absolutely. And what we had this morning from the second stooge, the member for Wentworth, at the doors, was that he walked out there and said that the government was responsible for interest rates going up, and in the next breath he said that if they came down we would not be responsible. He cannot have it both ways. On top of that, we had the third stooge—

                             As I remind people, when I give the call to an individual it is not an invitation for everybody to speak. When we are having down time between individuals getting the call, that is also not a time for everybody to speak.
