        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to her answer to the question from the member for Grey. What advice has the minister received from her department that details how the Australian taxpayer will avoid the states and private contractors from profiteering from the so-called

            I was asked about the potential for ‘rip-offs’, as the member styled it, and I am answering that question. The guidelines are clear. The distribution to schools is clear under the

            for the 21st Century program, the National School Pride Program, that is correlated to school size. The science and language laboratory program is a competitive bid program. Different schools are under different systems, obviously—block grant authorities, states and territories taking a different approach to tendering arrangements—

                 say that we need to remember that the context in which this is occurring is a global financial crisis. We know that the construction industry is being severely impacted by that global financial crisis. Consequently, because of that economic impact, in communities right around the country there is spare construction capacity, and without this economic stimulus the people working in those construction companies would become unemployed. I know that the member who asked the question and the member who is vying for him to be shadow minister for education might be unconcerned about that, because they voted against this program, but this government is concerned with delivering economic stimulus around the country, value-for-money projects that will make a difference to education infrastructure in this country through the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen, and support for jobs.
