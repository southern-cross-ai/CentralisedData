        I rise today to draw the attention of the House to a disturbing problem in the town of Maclean in my electorate. The community in Maclean is concerned about a large flying fox colony that may return to roost in the town over the next few weeks. This is an issue that goes back years and has once again become a major concern because of a decision by the

        , Water, Heritage and the Arts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Flying foxes make a significant amount of noise and leave a terrible stench, and their droppings damage vehicles and stain washing on clothes lines. Experts have also raised concerns about potential health risks associated with flying foxes. The recent case of Hendra virus in Queensland was believed to have been transmitted by a bat. For many years, these bats were legally protected from harassment, and the colony in Maclean grew to about 50,000 bats. The bats damaged many trees in the area known as ‘the gully’ and left the area in need of regeneration. There is significant concern among Maclean residents that the bats will move back into the gully for the nesting season, leaving them to face months of damage, odour and inconvenience—not to mention a health risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        The potential roosting area for the bat colony is next to Maclean High School, and the principal of the school is concerned that the bats will disrupt the upcoming

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECC" rel="nofollow">
         DECC
        </a>
        , to disrupt or disperse the bats. DECC recently commissioned a report into the situation. Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
         John Nelson
        </a>
        , a zoologist from

        </a>
        , has advised that the bat colony could be moved if it returns to the gully. He believes that the colony would naturally return to the Yaegl Nature Reserve, its current location. Dr Nelson believes that the bats can be dispersed using sound equipment without killing any of the animals. This technique has been used effectively in the past in Maclean and other areas affected by flying fox colonies. However, action must be taken quickly because the colony cannot be dispersed if the bats move back into the gully and begin breeding.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the past, a licence has been granted to disperse a small number of bats. As soon as the first flying foxes start to appear in the gully, they are scared away using the sound equipment, and this discourages the rest of the colony from landing in the area. Because the bats are a protected species, the New South Wales department has decided to refer the licence application to the federal department, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts for approval.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the first time since the initial licence was granted nine years ago that the licence application has been referred to the federal department. Against the considered view of the DECC, the federal department has decided that there is potential for the bats to be harmed and has requested that a public environment report be completed. The report may take up to six months and will cost up to $100,000. Even after the report is completed, there is still no guarantee that the community will be granted a licence to disturb the bats. That is $50,000 to $100,000 that would be better spent on educational resources for Maclean High School.
       </p>
       <p>
        The New South Wales DECC has no problem with the community’s plan. Expert opinion supports the licence application. There are already stringent controls in place to prevent harm to the bats. There is no reason that the licence should not be granted. The question must be asked: will the minister take responsibility for the health of Maclean High School students and staff? Common sense needs to prevail in this situation. The health and wellbeing of our young people must be put before a handful of bats. With the roosting season just around the corner, this issue needs urgent attention by the minister. I have written directly to him, requesting a speedy resolution of this situation. The people of Maclean have been able to disperse the bats in previous years. I urge the government to permit the same course of action to occur once again.
