         A good question from a good member! I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The regional member understands the importance, the need and the significance of the government's investment in infrastructure, particularly in water projects in our regions. We know that the best way to enable our regions to lead the country's COVID-19 recovery is through investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are investing in water security. In the budget we allocated another $2 billion under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, taking the total to $3½ billion. In the past year alone we have finished five major projects: Sunraysia Modernisation Project 2, South West Loddon Rural Water Supply Project, Coolanie Water Scheme, McLaren Vale Treated Water Storage and Scottsdale Irrigation Scheme. Charleston Dam, in northern Queensland, is near completion. A further 10 water projects are contracted and underway. We have signed the bilateral funding agreement with the Queensland government which will see works begin on a number of water projects in that state, one of which is Rookwood Weir, which I know is going to really benefit the electorates of Flynn and Capricornia.

         I'm asked about a plan and policies for regional Australia. I want to read from an important keynote speech, spruiking ideas for our regions, delivered in my home town,

         Who might have said that? Would it have been the member for Hunter? Would it have been the member for Isaacs? No, he would have yelled out, 'You're a disgrace!' It wasn't either of those two. It certainly wasn't the opposition leader, because he says one thing to the miners in Mackay and another to the baristas in Balmain. It might have been the member for Flynn, but it wasn't him, even though he's got 21 coal mines in his electorate which will benefit from the water security—

           Well, I'll let you all in on a little secret: it was the new shadow minister for resources, the member for Chifley himself. That's who said that. He said one thing then; I wonder what he's going to say in the future.
