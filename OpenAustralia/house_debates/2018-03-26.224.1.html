       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to Professor David Cooper AO, who passed away on 18 March in Sydney. Professor Cooper dedicated his life to the prevention, treatment and cure of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        and other infectious diseases. He made Australia a global leader in the fight against HIV/
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        and contributed to every therapeutic drug used in HIV. His experience in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        led him to diagnose the first Australian case of HIV in 1982. His case report on HIV seroconversion illness, which defines initial HIV infection in many people, published in

        in 1985, was seminal.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1986, Professor Cooper established the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, now known as the Kirby Institute for infection and immunity in society, and he was its inaugural director. Professor Cooper remained working in clinical trials his entire life, and his record of clinical and academic achievement was unparalleled. He was a past president of the

       <p>
        Professor Cooper was made an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2003 and awarded the James Cook Medal by the

         Thank you. Just indulge me. I would like to associate myself with the member for Sydney's comments. The passing of Professor Cooper is a very sad day, and all our world is the poorer for his passing.
