        It's been a difficult time for community organisations in Grey as they make decisions about whether or not to progress with their community events, given the vagaries of COVID lockdowns and restrictions. So I was very pleased indeed when it was decided that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorke_Peninsula_Field_Days" rel="nofollow">

        , a biennial event, would go ahead. They'd sought some advice from me and an assurance that the government would not leave them behind if they had to cancel at short notice, and Minister Littleproud was good enough to give me a general comment in that area. They went ahead. We were limited to 5,000 participants a day. I had a stand there. The field days were pretty much sold out every day and were a fabulous success. So well done them. Well done to Martin Kenny, the president,

        , and Paul Correll, who I had quite a bit to do with on this issue.

        At the same time, we've had a number of country shows. Some have chosen to cancel, and I bear them no grudge at all. It is difficult enough being on those committees; making those decisions is hard. But the Clare, Cleve,

        and Wudinna shows have all gone ahead, as has the one in my own home town of Kimba. It was one of the best events we've had in many years it would have to be said, and congratulations to

        and her team there. For those who chose not to go ahead, as I said, I've no condemnation. It's a difficult decision. But I was very pleased indeed when the government came out, I think last week or the week before, and announced that there was $25 million on the table to help these types of events to get through this difficult time of cancellations.
