        There's a place in southern Townsville. Its name is Wulguru. Every time it rains up there, the homes fill up with poo. The sewers get all backed up, the suburb really whiffs, and, despite the council's promises, the problem still persists.

Mum Nicole and daughter Shae to the Townsville hospital did go, when their home was inundated with a horrible brown flow. There have been other locals who've had to rebuild their home, after number ones and number twos throughout their house did roam. The thought makes the stomach turn—it leaves you feeling ill—so we have to send a message to the mayor,

        . So I've started up a website to make the council think: georgechristensen.com.au/stopthestink. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for letting me say my bit. So now I'll take my leave and stop rhyming about—
