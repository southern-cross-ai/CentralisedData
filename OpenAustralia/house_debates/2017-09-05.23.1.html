        I rise to acknowledge the contribution of Glen Shailer, one of the pioneers of the city of Logan. Lynette Shailer honoured her father simply at his eulogy at St Mark's Anglican Church yesterday: 'A good man, a good life.' Charles Glen Shailer was a man of character, a man who valued family and hard work, and our community is a better place because he was part of it. Publicly, he will be remembered as the first mayor of

        , serving one term from 1982, after which Logan was officially declared a city in 1981.
       </p>
       <p>
        Privately, he will be remembered as a family man, a father, a farmer and a fighter who never shied away from his duty. Charles Glen Shailer was born on 20 May 1918. Shailer Park in Logan is named after his family as they were the first settlers in the area. Most of his childhood was spent growing up in 'an exciting time'—in his own words—and one of his favourite childhood memories was seeing

        during the last leg of his famous flight across the Pacific in 1928. Mr Shailer contributed so much to our community over the years. Glen met Sylvia Bahr in Carbrook in 1941 and they were married for some 60 years. I wish to thank him for his service to our community, and may he rest in peace.
