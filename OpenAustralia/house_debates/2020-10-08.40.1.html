        The Morrison government is continuing to deliver vital infrastructure upgrades on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The 2020-21 budget injects an additional $16.7 million into the already announced $69.8 million Central Coast Roads Package. This funding will assist in upgrading the existing single-lane roundabout at the Rawson Road intersection at

        —an important thoroughfare for residents on the peninsular in my electorate of Robertson. It will benefit commuters on their way to work, local students on their way to school and local businesses who are impacted by congestion. This includes businesses like Dewars Cabinets, a local business that has been on the Central Coast for 35 years. The owner, Kevin Dewar, has said that the Rawson Road intersection has been getting worse over many years, with more and more people deciding to call the peninsula home. He said, 'These upgrades will really benefit those who use Ocean Beach Road and Rawson Road, and it's great to see the government supporting the people of the peninsula.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The Central Coast Roads Package will deliver 29 individual road upgrades across the coast, including Rawson Road. Eight are already completed and eight are under construction. The package is expected to support 190 direct and indirect jobs, which are especially crucial as we recover from the economic impacts of COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        Infrastructure projects like these not only create better facilities but build stronger local communities. The Morrison government is determined to continue to deliver for the Central Coast—the very best region in the very best country in the world.
