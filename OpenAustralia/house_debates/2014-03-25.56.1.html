        Madam Speaker, my question is addressed to the Treasurer. How will abolishing the mining tax assist to grow the economy and create jobs?

         I thank the honourable member for the question, and I note that from day one he has been opposed to the mining tax. And from day one the coalition has been opposed to the mining tax. And what a horrible birth this tax had. I well recall
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
          Colin Barnett
         </a>
         , the Liberal Premier of

          Western Australia
         </a>
         , ringing up Prime Minister Rudd and asking him what could he possibly be thinking to introduce a tax like that. And
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         responded that it was all Wayne Swan's idea. And so the architect of the tax, which has been a complete, unmitigated disaster for the Labor Party, is still in the Labor Party, is still in opposition, is still in parliament and is still supporting upholding a tax that has been an abject failure. In 100 years' time when tax classes are taught at university they will look back and ask, 'Mr Professor, what was the worst tax that was ever designed?' And the professor will respond, 'It was the five versions of the mining tax'.

           The carbon tax is close, but there was only one version of the carbon tax. There are five versions of a mining tax that originally was meant to raise $12Â½ billion next year and at the end of the day is hardly raising anything. The problem is Labor spent the money that they never got: $16 billion of expenditure; $16 billion they precommitted, pre-spent against a tax that barely raises a dollar. That is irresponsible budgeting. You would not do it in your home, let alone for the nation. But Labor did, because that is the Labor way.
          </p>
          <p>
           And the other part of the Labor way is this unholy partnership with the Greens. It was the Greens that they relied on to get passage of the mining tax. It was the Greens who they relied upon an hour ago in the Senate to oppose the repeal of the mining tax. It was the Greens who supported them to deliver a carbon tax and it was the Greens who supported Labor to uphold the carbon tax. The only way to get rid of the mining tax is to vote for the Liberals and the Nationals in the upcoming Senate election in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           . The only way to get rid of the carbon tax is to vote for the Liberals and the Nationals in the upcoming Senate election in Western Australia. The only way to send a message to the Labor Party is: never vote for them and never support them. But even then, Labor still stands by bad policies that cost jobs and cost families' their income.
