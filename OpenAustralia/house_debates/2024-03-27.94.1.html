        My question is to the Prime Minister. How do we build a future made in Australia? What's been standing in the way of making more things here,

         I thank the member for Paterson for her question. I look forward to being back in the Hunter tomorrow with the member for Hunter, the member for Paterson and other members. We'll be speaking about the importance, in that great manufacturing centre of Australia, of making things right here in Australia—not just exporting our resources that give a great deal of value to our national economy and create jobs but, where we can, making sure that we value-add. That is an issue for our economy, but it's also an issue of our national security because we need to be a resilient economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need to be an economy that isn't dependent and vulnerable to shocks, be it a pandemic or be it conflict internationally, which can have an impact on the Australian economy. That's why there is such a stark contrast. Our government does believe in a future made in Australia. It does believe in investing in solar and wind and new energy; investing in manufacturing and critical minerals; and investing in people through fee-free

         and the plan that's been put forward by the education minister through the Universities Accord. It believes in creating jobs in our suburbs and creating jobs in our regions; building energy security, economic security and national security; and moving up the international value chain.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a whole-of-nation opportunity that we have which requires a whole-of-economy approach, and that is my government's approach. It does stand in contrast to the impediments which have been there. I was quite stunned that yesterday the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport sent out a tweet about

         s. She said:

         The changes being mooted by the Labor's policy are the most significant changes to our auto and motoring industry since we shut down manufacturing.

        <p>
         Wow. She put her hand up in a tweet. But then, just in case it was an error, later she held a press conference and she said: 'The changes being mooted by the Labor Party's policy are the most significant changes to our automobile industry, to our motoring industry, since we shut down manufacturing.' She went on and she said: 'That's a fact.' It sure is a fact. That fact is that the coalition's shadow minister for infrastructure and transport—
