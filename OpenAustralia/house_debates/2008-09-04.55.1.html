        <p>
         I thank the member for Dawson for his question and for his acknowledgement that nation-building infrastructure is critical for his electorate, and, indeed, that is why it is at the heart of the Rudd government’s economic reforms. If you actually listened to those opposite and their attitudes towards infrastructure and towards the budget surplus and if you analysed what they did in the Senate, you would think that they had no regard at all for infrastructure. We have heard allegations that these funds are not real, that they are not important and that it does not matter whether we make that long-term infrastructure investment. But, whilst they say that through their spokespeople in the parliament and whilst they act on that in the Senate by undermining the budget surplus, what they do as local members is very different. I have a folder here with 103 submissions from many of the members of the opposition frontbench. Thirty-five coalition MPs have made submissions to me about infrastructure spending—more than half of their frontbench. That indeed is what you would expect local members to do about infrastructure. Many members on this side of the House are also making submissions about infrastructure spending.

               The member for Groom mentioned this in 1998—and you can all look on the website because first speeches are easy to find—and he promised that it would be finished by 2005. That was in his first speech, but he did nothing while he was a senior cabinet minister. He waited for the Rudd government to come to office and then he wrote me a letter. Congratulations! And I table the letter. But there is more. The member for Flinders wrote to me supporting the creation of a community infrastructure fund and put forward seven pages of projects worth $266.92 million. But there is more—

                           You will get the point; it is coming, Sunshine! The fact is that for 12 long years—and indeed since the election, so for almost 13 years—we have heard those opposite say, ‘Public transport is solely a state responsibility; it has nothing to do with us.’ There was no engagement with urban policy and no engagement with cities. We heard it for 12 years—no engagement with public transport. And yet the member for Cowan has written asking for funding for a mass transit solution for Perth’s northern suburbs. He asks for funding for buses, for light rail and for rail. Not just that—remember how day after day they said the

                           did not matter? Well, they are not just asking; they are pleading. I will read from the member for Cowan’s letter. It states, ‘As federal transport minister I implore you to support this proposal through funding from the Infrastructure Australia Fund.’ Imploring!

                              What we see from the coalition is that in one chamber—the Senate—they are voting against our surplus, voting to reduce the amount of funds that can be used on the Building Australia Fund, and in this House member after member is asking—pleading—for expenditure from the Building Australia Fund. In one chamber they knock it down and in the other they plead for funding. Well, they cannot have it both ways. The total funding requests in this folder are a conservative $6.9 billion. That is what they are asking for. But in the other chamber they are ripping out $6.2 billion.

                              What they need to do is to put the principles that they espouse in this correspondence and the principles that they talk about in their electorates about the importance of infrastructure funding into practice and vote for our measures, vote for the surplus, and support the government’s long-term infrastructure agenda.
