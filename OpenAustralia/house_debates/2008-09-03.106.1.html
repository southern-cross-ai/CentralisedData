        Indigenous Music Awards and the Darwin Festival, which finished on Sunday, have shown yet again that the best of the best is synonymous with the best of the bush. This year marks the 30th year since the Darwin Festival was first held, in 1978, as the Bougainvillea Festival. Since then it seems to have become bigger and better with each passing year. Record crowds and top-quality entertainment were the order of the day this year.

        Artists, musicians and dancers from my electorate of Lingiari were especially prominent this year. I am very proud to represent such a multitalented mob, who always have so much to offer every year to discerning festival audiences. In dance, Lingiari was represented by the Kenbi Dancers from Belyuen, the high-profile Red Flag Dancers from Numbulwar and the esteemed Yawalyu women from Lajamanu. Yawalyu performed in conjunction with Darwin’s

        All in all, it was a tremendous spectacle—indeed, it was a tribute to the vibrancy of contemporary bush culture. My congratulations to all involved, especially to outgoing festival director Malcolm Blaylock.
