        </a>
        have qualified to compete in the grand final after qualifying in their respective age groups. In order to qualify, each of them had to gain points by competing in various events around Australia over the last 12 months. Each result gained them points, with the top 20 from each age division qualifying for the Australian team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Darren Adams, who has qualified, also trains nine of the triathletes at Swift Multisport in Yamba. Darren puts his success down to fun and enjoying hard work. Most of the competitors he trains would put in between 10 and15 hours a week spread over six days.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grand final event is currently underway on the Gold Coast, with approximately 5,000 triathletes competing from 45 nations. I would like to wish Isaiah Koopmans from Woolgoolga and Michael Ylinen from Moonee Beach all the best. Also, good luck to the 13 Clarence Valley triathletes: Darren Adams,

        Callum Robson is a 17-year-old surfer in my electorate who is about to make huge waves on the international scene. He will be representing Australia in the International Surfing Association World Surfing Games in Japan this week. One of only six Australian surfers chosen for the team, Callum was selected after great performances in the pro junior division in the World Surf League. He is currently second in the rankings, having already qualified for the world junior championships later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Callum is putting his carpentry apprenticeship on hold in a bid to make the professional surfing tour. The Japanese event will hopefully be a stepping stone for Callum, with Surfing Australia hoping to build a team to go to the
