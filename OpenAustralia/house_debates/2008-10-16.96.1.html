        I rise this morning to support calls from parents within my electorate for a R18+ rating system to be applied to video games. Currently the highest maximum rating that can be applied to video games is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA" rel="nofollow">

        15+ rating under the system. The relevant legislation is the Classification (Publications, Films and

        ) Act 1995 as—

        As I was saying, games—video games in particular—have advanced in the last 30 years. They are full of complex concepts and adult themes, and there really is very little to differentiate them from films. Of course, under the Classification (Publications, Films And Computer Games) Act 1995, there is a lack of consistency in the ratings that are applied across these media. It is the case that there are four classifications for video games and six classifications for films. I think it is a sensible proposition that, if it is good enough for television that we assess that some films are not able to be rated as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA15" rel="nofollow">
         MA15
        </a>
        + and require a higher rating of R18+, then that ought to be the case for video games.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that on 27 and 28 March this year the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        of Attorneys-General met and agreed in principle to a consultation in relation to an R18+ scheme for video games—a national classification scheme—and this is a good development. They have also agreed to consider, at a subsequent meeting, the outcome of the public consultation on this issue and resolve whether an R18+ classification for computer games should be introduced into the national classification system, and whether amendments to give effect thereto should proceed. This is a good development and a welcome one for the parents in my electorate who have raised this matter with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not one who seeks to censor what freely thinking adults may view or think, but, in the case of children and people who we define as minors, regulation is lagging behind the reality of modern video games. Indeed, it is important to note that from all of the representations I have received from the parents in my electorate, they understand that this rating system is no substitute for responsible parenting and parents taking an interest in their children. In fact, I find these parents to be the most responsible, because they, in spite of the lack of classification, ensure that all of the material that their children watch in these video games is suitable. But, in a complex and diverse world, with technological advances, this will be an important aid to parents. There is a case that consistency must be applied and I strongly recommend that the consultation process proceed and that we ensure that we move as quickly as possible to ensure an R18+ classification is applied to computer games and video games.
