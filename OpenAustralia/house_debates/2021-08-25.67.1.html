        My question is to the Prime Minister. Eight days into the Sydney outbreak the Prime Minister congratulated the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Premier for not locking down. Two months later, the whole of New South Wales is in extended lockdown, with a record 919 new cases today, and the outbreak has spread to Victoria, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        and even
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . New South Wales hospitals are at breaking point. Will the Prime Minister accept that his complacency contributed to the current circumstances?

              It is a function of the delta variant of the COVID-19 virus. Those opposite might like to think that Australia is somehow immune to a global pandemic. Perhaps they think that the fault of there being a lockdown in

But what sensible people understand is that what we are going through is a global pandemic. In this country, the actions of the government, together with governments around the country, have saved 30,000 lives, and a million people are back in work. What I note this year, because I remember last year very vividly when Melbourne was going through the lockdown—

                  It is on relevance, Mr Speaker. The question went to whether there was any responsibility for the fact that the Prime Minister encouraged and congratulated the

                   I would just say to the Leader of the Opposition that he doesn't need to restate the question.

                   No, he doesn't need to restate it. That's the last thing he needs to do. When the Leader of the Opposition says it was a very specific question, it was a very specific question at the end of a very long preamble. That doesn't open the question up entirely, but I'm listening to the Prime Minister to ensure he is being relevant to the question. The Prime Minister has the call.

                    All premiers, all chief ministers, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and others have had to make many decisions over the course of this pandemic, and collectively those decisions have saved 30,000 lives in this country—something envied by countries all around the world—and we have an economy that remains incredibly resilient and a million people coming back into work after the COVID-19 recession last year. Those are the decisions that governments have been taking and they are the results that are being achieved.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The delta variant, as we know, completely changed everything in terms of our COVID response, and the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    government made decisions, and they have been making decisions over the course of this pandemic. On previous occasions they have made decisions where they haven't locked down, which enabled children to still go to school and enabled businesses to remain open and avoid the great hardship of the lockdowns which cause terrible ruin on people. These lockdowns are hard to endure. They are necessary at this time, but only as long as they need to be.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The New South Wales government have sought to avoid those lockdowns over the course of this pandemic. Those opposite may want to charge in and attack the New South Wales government for their efforts. They may seek to do that. I am not going to do that. What I know is that last year over 800 lives were lost in Victoria. This year, in New South Wales, 76 have been lost. We're making great progress in fighting this pandemic, and I thank all the premiers for their efforts.
