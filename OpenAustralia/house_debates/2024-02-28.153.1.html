        On 8 March, we will celebrate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        . This day is celebrated annually as a focus point for women's rights, with the movement giving focus to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights and violence and abuse against women. It is a day of civil awareness for women and girls. This year the theme is 'Count her in: accelerating gender equality through economic empowerment'. This resonates profoundly, urging us to reflect on the strides we have made and the work that lies ahead in ensuring a more equitable world for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economic empowerment is a critical pillar in the journey towards gender equality. When we talk about empowering women economically we are not merely talking about financial independence; we are talking about dismantling barriers, challenging stereotypes and creating an environment where women are not just included but thrive in every sector. We have certainly made progress over the years, with women excelling in fields once deemed exclusive to men.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, gender disparities persist. As we work to eliminate the gender pay gap and underrepresentation in leadership positions, women overseas now face an assault on their reproductive rights, and in some countries young women and girls are barred from receiving an education or working. Economic empowerment serves as a catalyst for change. When women are economically empowered, they can make choices about their lives, their education, their health and their overall wellbeing. It is about more than earning a pay cheque; it is about having a seat at the table, influencing decisions and contributing to shaping a more inclusive society.
       </p>
       <p>
        So today I wanted to give a shout-out to all the women and girls in my electorate of Pearce and all around the world. Whether they be at school, in tertiary education or serving an apprenticeship, I know they are pushing boundaries. To the women who are in part-time work or full-time work or serving on a board, please know that you are valued and your work counts. To those who are our strength at home—the caregivers, the retired or the service volunteers in our community—please know that your views count. Many of you have been at the forefront of changes that we have achieved to date, and this is a day we celebrate together. The women in my electorate of Pearce are amazing. They do not want to be just present; they want to thrive, and I'm always very happy to continue to encourage them. As we celebrate International Women's Day on 8 March let us remember those amazing women who came before us to break down barriers, and commit to counting every woman in—ensuring she has the tools, resources and opportunities to succeed.
