        I must have been in a different party room! After yesterday's successful passing of the Road Safety Remuneration Repeal Bill 2016 I have been inundated with support and thanks. The response is heartening and just goes to show how passionate the truckies of Flynn are about their ability to provide for their families and to the nation's call.

        I would just like to take the time to thank you for the support and effort you and your colleagues afforded the transport industry in getting rid of the RSRT. It does not go unnoticed    and it is widely appreciated amongst us small transport operators.

        I was fortunate enough to have a woman from my electorate, Julie Just, here in Canberra yesterday. I saw her late last night after she left the House after a marathon day walking between the Senate and this House. She was understandably very emotional and thanked me very much for the job we had all done for her and her industry. This emotion just shows how much was on the line for these people. That was evident from the people down at the rally on the grass outside the front of

        . These hardworking people, representing 35,000 owner-drivers, can now go back to their place of work and do the very best they can for themselves and for the country.
