        Recently, I had the privilege of attending the premiere of
        <i>
         Fearless Films
        </i>
        season 4, starring Dawson's own Adam Broadstock, who resides in Mackay.
        <i>

        </i>
        is an all-inclusive project by Feros Care that shares stories about people living with a disability. They inspire and they're very thought-provoking. They help those of us who haven't experienced living with a disability understand what the trials and tribulations are like.
       </p>
       <p>
        Season 4 features the stories of six people living with a disability who are carving out careers for themselves and who are engaged in meaningful employment, be it entrepreneurial or in the workplace. The films are produced by a fantastic team of producers and filmmakers of all abilities. I was honoured to be part of their premiere screening and was inspired by these men and women who have worked through great adversity to grow their careers. Their bold aspirations and the fulfilment they find in their work was a great source of encouragement to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        As our country faces workforce shortages, it's the ideal time to tap in to these willing participants who live with a disability. People of all abilities play an integral role in our workforce. I would like to pay tribute to those living with a disability who are overcoming great challenges to participate in the workforce each and every day. Well done.
