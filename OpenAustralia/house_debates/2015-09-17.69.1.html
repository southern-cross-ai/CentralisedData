        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, people clearly have faith in you to make things happen. Can you justify that faith by: building, with the Queensland government, the rail line into the Galilee; mandating ethanol and biodiesel, rescuing grains, sugar and cattle; decreeing that all government cars be Australian made and our naval ships be built in Cairns and Adelaide; and instituting a reserve resource policy, rescuing steel, fertiliser and aluminium?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. I think we all thank him for his passionate patriotism. I recognise the great commitment he has to all of these matters—the growth of Australian industry and its infrastructure—especially in his own electorate. We understand that. The honourable member is perfectly entitled to enumerate projects like that in the House to bring them to the government's attention. That is what question time should be all about.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government that I lead is committed to considering all of the economic challenges facing Australia and the opportunities for driving productivity and increasing economic growth to ensure that the consequence of the decline in terms of trade is offset by new industries, new jobs and greater productivity. That is the big challenge for us. I want the honourable member to know that we are taking on that task with great seriousness, careful thought and consideration. His constituents, like the constituents of every other member in this chamber, will be foremost in our minds as we ensure that his children and his grandchildren, and those of his constituents, will have a bright economic future right around Australia in the years ahead.
