       <p>
        One year ago today, Jina Mahsa Amini was arrested by Iran's morality police for what they deemed an improper way of wearing her hijab. What followed was horrifying, leading ultimately to her tragic death in police custody three days later. Her story is testament to the injustices faced by countless individuals in Iran, especially women and girls, whose fundamental rights and freedoms continue to be violated today. In the wake of this incident, the world bore witness to the resilience of the Iranian people, particularly women, as a wave of protest was ignited in Iran and across the world.

       <p>
        Today, the Albanese government imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on four individuals and targeted financial sanctions on three entities responsible for the oppression of people in Iran, particularly women and girls. Not only do these sanctions mark the first time Australia has imposed these types but also it's on top of three packages of sanctions that have been implemented in the last year. The Albanese government, in 12 months, have taken out more actions against this horrible regime than any previous government before it.

        I would like to thank the foreign minister and her staff for listening to MPs like me and, of course, for listening to the

        community across the country. I will continue to stand in solidarity with my local Iranian Australian community and fight for justice for them: women, life, freedom.
