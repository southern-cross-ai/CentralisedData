        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. He will be aware and has been involved in a number of briefings about Australia's involvement in that area. I hope that he has received, through those briefings, an adequate understanding of what is proposed. I welcome the bipartisanship that has been demonstrated in support of Australia's troops, particularly our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         personnel who are operating in those areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Leader of the Opposition will know, these people are there to do a job. The job is an important one. Clearly it involves supporting the Iraqi people in defending their own security, but I think it is also a demonstration to the world that Australia takes its responsibilities as a medium-ranking power to do what we can to deliver a safer world for all of its citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are there to do a job, and we will be there until the job is finished. We wish all of those involved that their operations will be safe and secure. There are dangers, in spite of the modern equipment and in spite of the work being done to ensure there are adequate measures in place in the event of there being any incident so that our airmen can be returned safely to their bases. There are a range of procedures in place to ensure that the measures and the activities we are undertaking are both successful and safe. We recognise, however, that in all war theatres there is danger and we certainly wish our troops and our airmen a safe journey back to Australia. I cannot give you a date as to when that will be—we all hope that it will be soon—but we will not be leaving until the job is done.
