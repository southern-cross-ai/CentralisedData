        Recently I had the privilege of participating in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        Parliamentary Program. Spending a week based in Darwin on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Resolute" rel="nofollow">
         Operation Resolute
        </a>
        , I lived at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrakeyah_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Larrakeyah Barracks
        </a>
        and experienced border protection operations with Defence Force personnel from the Army, Navy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        . I shared living quarters and meals with our troops and participated in operational activities under supervision. It was an invaluable experience to witness the work of our Defence Force personnel over the course of a whole week. It provided me with a new perspective on the duties, challenges, resourcing constraints and issues faced by our serving personnel. As a decision-maker, the experience will better equip me to advocate on behalf of the Australian Defence Force when relevant issues arise in parliament. I am pleased to say that the $31 billion allocated in the current federal budget for Defence spending puts it on a growth path to two per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

        by 2023-24, which is consistent with the coalition's election commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I gained a better appreciation of the magnitude of the task of patrolling and securing Australia's borders on a vast geographical scale that defies comprehension. Australia's extensive exclusive economic zone covers 8.1 million square kilometres. The challenges faced by our Defence Force, customs and border protection agencies is compounded by the vastness of the Australian continent, covering an area of more than 7.6 million square kilometres, with a total coastline length of 35,876 kilometres. I would like to thank my hosting officer, Major Glyn Richardson, who did a remarkable job in organising the logistics of my visit and making sure that the events occurred with military precision. I am grateful to Major Paul Richards for arranging my participation from headquarters in Canberra. My thanks also go to the following personnel for welcoming me and allowing me to actively participate in operational activities: Commodore Brenton Smyth, commander of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The highlights of my visit included a patrol on board the HMAS
        <i>
         Wollongong
        </i>
        , in particular the live firing exercises with the .50 calibre machine gun and the 5.56mm
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        minimi machine gun. I was taken on a comprehensive tour of the Australian customs vessel, the
        <i>
         Cape Sorrell
        </i>
        . I also experienced a journey in a landing craft, fast transfer in a rigid-hulled inflatable boat and a boarding party exercise. However, the best part was a visit to the armoury where I reacquainted myself with the standard-issue 5.56mm AusSteyr F88 rifle and Browning Hi-Power 9mm pistol. This was followed by a visit to the weapons training and simulation system at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Robertson Barracks
        </a>
        , where I was in my element and easily met the ADF qualification standards for marksmanship. I also experienced a surveillance flight aboard a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3_Orion" rel="nofollow">
         P3 Orion
        </a>
        aircraft, during which we encountered two unidentified vessels that did not respond. The program also included a visit to the Department of Agriculture for a tour of the quarantine operations, which included laboratory facilities to screen and identify foreign organisms.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program is a most worthy experience for members of parliament. Having participated twice, I can thoroughly recommend it. It has strengthened my regard for the members of the Australian Defence Force and impressed upon me the need to adequately resource our troops.
