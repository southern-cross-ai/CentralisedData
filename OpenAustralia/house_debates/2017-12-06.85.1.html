        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Will the minister update the House on the government's action to guarantee affordable and reliable energy for hardworking Australians and businesses, including in my electorate and neighbouring communities like Bennelong? How does this compare to the risks associated with alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          North Sydney
         </a>
         for his question and know he's focused on driving lower prices and a more stable energy system for his constituents and right across the country. He supports the Turnbull government's actions to rein in the power of the networks, to provide more gas to Australians before it's exported overseas, to get a better deal from retailers for millions of Australians and to put in place the National Energy Guarantee, under which we will see significant savings for Australian consumers.
        </p>

         I'm asked: are there any alternative approaches? We know that under federal Labor when they were last in office, power prices went up 100 per cent. And we also know that when Labor was in office in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         between 2006 and 2011, power prices went up 60 per cent. And do you know who had their hands on the levers of power in New South Wales? It was

         </a>
         and Senator Sam Dastyari, her personal pick. So you can imagine my surprise when I looked at the Labor Party's website to find there was a special invitation: Christmas trivia with Senator Sam Dastyari and special guest the Hon. Kristina Keneally. It was organised by—guess what?—the Central Policy Branch. I guess they were getting together to work out a Mediscare campaign, to drive up energy prices or to drive up taxes! And what was on the menu come Christmas time was duck—probably peking duck!
        </p>
        <p>
         I looked at the price and thought: 'This could be a good deal. What is the price for a trivia night with Senator Sam Dastyari and Kristina Keneally?' It is $150.

            The Minister for the Environment and Energy might take his seat for a second. Member for Chifley, you're only just back; you don't want to be out again.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do allow a fair degree of latitude, but I listened to the question fairly closely and, whilst you can compare and contrast, I can't see what you're saying now is relevant to the question that was asked. How can I say this politely—you really need to relate the material to the question that you've been asked. The minister has the call.

             The reality is, when
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristina_Keneally" rel="nofollow">
              Kristina Keneally
             </a>
             was the Premier of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             , power prices went up, and we know that Senator Sam Dastyari had a major role in the Labor Party in New South Wales at the same time. So, now that Kristina Keneally is running for Bennelong, and Senator Sam Dastyari could be her future colleague, what will that mean for the people of Bennelong? Higher power prices.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I saw that they were going to be hosting an event together, I thought I should book a table, but, when I went online, what happened to the event? Suddenly the Labor Party's website said the event was cancelled—'The page you were looking for was not found.' So suddenly Kristina Keneally and Senator Sam Dastyari don't want to bring the old band back together.
