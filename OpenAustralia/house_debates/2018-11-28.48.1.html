       <p>
        I'm honoured to inform the House, as mentioned by the member for Rankin, that the Moreton-Rankin Unity Shield cricket cup that we held a fortnight ago has been retained north of Compton Road, remaining with its rightful owners, Moreton. I would also like to note that in this fifth annual match Moreton's first innings 110 was the highest-ever score. I'll leave any commentary to the member for Rankin if he needs to correct that record later on. I do note my contribution of five runs with the bat and four wickets with the ballâ€”good preparation for Sunday. The game was played in a very positive spirit, with just a hint of well-established and friendly rivalry.

        I put on the record that the energetic Rohingya Strikers might have helped my side, although I did have a couple of primary school kids. Ali Kadri, my great captain from the Islamic Council of Queensland, has been doing great work with these young Rohingya who love their cricket. It's a wonderful event. As the member for Rankin said, it's about embracing people and doing all we can to promote cohesion and understanding, not the fear and division some people like to cultivate.
       </p>

        I thank Ahsan Assadi, the captain of the Rankin team;

        for providing a wonderful umpire. I look forward to the next match with the member for Rankin, where we'll be going for the trifecta or the hat-trick.
