        I would like to talk today about a unique microbusiness that deserves special mention. It is in my electorate and it is called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JACK" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        mail. Some of you may have seen the red van around Canberra with the JACKmail logo on it. It is a postal pick-up and delivery service that caters to Canberra businesses, but it is a service with a difference. About five years ago, Sally and Mac—Jackson's parents—started a small business built around their son, Jackson, who has Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, which has deprived his brain of the proteins essential for brain development. Jackson has a profound intellectual disability and requires support for almost every activity of his daily life. Sally Richards decided to create a small business around what her son does best—that is, he is a fabulous walker, he can carry parcels, he loves car travel and listening to music. So a courier business made sense and with great business nous, she single-handedly established JACKmail.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, Jackson works five days a week and is helped by a truly wonderful Canberran, Philippe, who is Jackson's support worker and delivery driver. I have been told by some of the businesses who use JACKmail just how valuable and meaningful this service is. Each morning Philippe and Jackson arrive with a big welcome and greeting. Everyone says hello to Jackson, they make him feel welcome and valued, but he also provides a very important service—mail and parcel deliveries. As his mother Sally has said, Jackson now has a legitimate and valued place in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        business community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jackson has travelled over 67,000 kilometres, completed almost 18,000 deliveries, worked almost 5,000 hours and, most importantly, JACKmail has given Jackson a quality of life his mother could only have dreamed of before she established this microbusiness.
