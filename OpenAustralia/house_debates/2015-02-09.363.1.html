        (1) In respect of the Deakin University's Centre for Research in Educational Futures and Innovation's report Australian international graduates and the transition to employment (September 2014), is he aware that the findings illustrate that (a) the overseas student program needs to be reviewed by the

         The Minister for Employment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         notes research from a wide and varying range of sources, including Deakin University's Centre for Research in Educational Futures and Innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2) Softer demand from mining and manufacturing has contributed to greater applicant competition for vacancies for engineers over the past two years. That's why the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Coalition Government
         </a>
         is focused on building a stronger and more prosperous economy so that employers, such as those mentioned, have an economic environment where they can employ and take on additional employees. That's why Labor's proposal to further slow down the mining industry through its mining tax would have been utterly disastrous for jobs.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is noted that the
