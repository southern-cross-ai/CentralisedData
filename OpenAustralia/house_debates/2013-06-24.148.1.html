       <p>
        A couple of weeks ago, I watched a live theatre production by the Tea Tree Players at their theatre in Surrey Downs in the Makin electorate. The production was called
        <i>
         I Bet Your Life
        </i>
        . It was a comedy with a plot that kept you guessing. Even though it was a cold and wet Friday evening, the theatre had a near full house. The performance was repeated several times over a two-week period. The production of films has clearly had an impact on live theatre, but a good live production still has a special appeal and that was the case with the performance by the Tea Tree Players. The acting was first class and, as with all live performances, the ability of the actors to connect with the audience made for great entertainment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to thank the Tea Tree Players not only for an excellent production of
        <i>
         I Bet Your Life
        </i>
        but for continuing to bring live theatre to the local community on a regular basis since their start-up in 1976. Since that time, they have presented 196 productions and 1,224 performances. As with any community group, they survive because of the hard work, commitment and dedication of a small band of people who perform, run the canteen, make costumes and stage sets, and maintain the theatre. I particularly acknowledge and commend the cast of
        <i>
         I Bet Your Life—
        </i>
        Lisa Mathews,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hawkins" rel="nofollow">

        , Paul Zechner, Stacey Hendy, Sophie Gardner, Gabe Steinhauer, Karen Marks, Don Stuart and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Brown" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —and the director,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Phillips" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Watching live theatre is unlike watching films or listening to music. It is entirely different. You get a much better understanding of the ability of the performers. It is something I always enjoy doing.
       </p>

        On a similar note, only last Friday I attended a live performance called
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Showtime" rel="nofollow">
          It's Showtime
         </a>
        </i>
        <i>

        </i>
        , put on by year 8-12 students at the Salisbury East High School. Under the arts coordinator, Chris Frahn, and her team the students put together an excellent evening of entertainment, which included artistic performances, music and art exhibitions—again, a credit to the young people of the school and a credit also to Jacqui van Ruiten, the principal, and Chris Frahn and her team for giving the kids the opportunity to express themselves through the performing arts. They did so with distinction and in a way that left everyone on the night commending them for their efforts. It is great to see these kinds of performances originating in our schools.
