        In Parramatta we have an enormous amount of talent, but it is not always seen. That is why for the last two years I have hired a stall at the Parramasala Festival to showcase some of our extraordinary local fashion designers. It means that they get the visibility they deserve, and, for me and people like me, we have the added benefit of being able to buy some clothes for our wardrobe.

        Parramasala began in 2010 as a

        festival but has evolved into a three-day celebration of the diversity of Western Sydney's cultures. You are now just as likely to see a Balinese orchestra or drummers from the

        as you are to see traditional Indian classical or folk music.

        I spent last weekend hosting the Own It store for the second year, selling clothes and accessories designed or crafted by local businesswomen. The labels included Ilham A Ismail, Pacific Breeze, Wachena Africa, Ruth Fattal Haute Couture, Melange Chic, Seewaa, Tiana Van and Voeurn Chea. As you can tell by the names of the labels, all of these designers have different backgrounds and bring their own culture, colour and experience to their designs. The response from customers is always fabulous to behold. We do not often have the opportunity in Australia to purchase necklaces hand beaded by the Masai women but designed by Fijian-Indian Australians or Indian hand printed wearable art.

        Wearing an exquisite Islamic inspired outfit by Ilham A Ismail in white and gold, I also marched the length of

        with the designers and their models. Special thanks must go to Sharon Garrard for her creativity and all her support in making it happen.
