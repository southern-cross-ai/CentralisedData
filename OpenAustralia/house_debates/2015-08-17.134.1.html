        Mr Speaker, can I add my voice to the many congratulations, particularly today, when you have been formally recognised by the Governor-General as the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today to draw attention to the issue of inequitable access to higher education opportunities for the youth of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        relative to their urban counterparts. On 4 August, I hosted a forum together with Senator Bridget McKenzie and a panel of representatives from the Department of Education and the Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">

        . Over 65 people attended the forum, including grandparents; parents; university, high school and gap year students; education professionals; and others concerned at the barriers country kids are experiencing in obtaining a tertiary education. I commend the attendees for sharing their personal, often heart-wrenching stories, and I acknowledge their well-considered recommendations on how the federal government can address the obstacles they have encountered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together we heard of the emotional as well as financial costs for regional students having to leave home and the security of family, friends and mentors to set up a life in the city, taking full responsibility for the daily necessities of feeding, clothing and transporting themselves, as well as securing a job while maintaining their studies. Many are ineligible for any government financial assistance. The most common scenario cited was students who have worked towards youth allowance eligibility under the regional independence criteria, only to fail due to the parental income threshold of $150,000. These parents then end up paying the living expenses of $17,000 to $25,000 per year. One parent at the forum had put four children through their higher education, and another had spent $250,000 over the past 10 years. Many parents and students struggled with the complicated eligibility criteria. One highly educated parent clocked up 80 hours assisting their child in filling out the documentation. I wonder how less educated or extremely busy parents assist their children in meeting such eligibility criteria.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, eligibility for youth allowance under any of the independence criteria was cited as a major barrier for country students, due to the limited availability and seasonality of regional employment. Concerns were voiced about regional and metropolitan Centrelink offices providing inconsistent information or losing critical documentation; multiple appeals being required to attain eligibility; unacceptable delays; and suspension of payments. We heard of unavoidable issues like a break in work history due to illness causing suspension of payment in several cases, and one student lived in his car for three weeks awaiting his first youth allowance payment.
       </p>

        But it is not all bad news. Although Western Australia, unlike the eastern states, does not have any large regional universities, in Albany we are fortunate enough to have a regional campus of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Australia
        </a>
        . It provides a few full degree courses and first year units, enabling local students to complete at least some of their studies close to home. Our Great Southern Institute of Technology seeks to offer degree programs in nursing and other in-demand qualifications through university partnerships so local students can be educated in situ and hopefully graduate to contribute to our much-needed regional professional workforce. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Albany" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is proactively trying to grow Albany as a tertiary education destination, and I strongly endorse the efforts of Mayor Dennis Wellington and his deputy, Greg Stocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of all, I acknowledge the quality of our local students. They are distinguished by their excellent academic achievement, qualifying for university places only to be hampered in their aspirations by the tyranny of distance from their desired course and the inherent financial barriers to obtaining self-sufficiency. The principals who attended the think tank I convened after the forum confirmed that up to 80 per cent of their 2014 graduates qualified for university entrance, yet 97 per cent would take a gap year, largely due to financial considerations. Deferral from university only holds the place for 12 months, yet students have to take 12 to 24 months to qualify for youth allowance under the various different criteria. Those who take time out are often lost to the temptations of a regular disposable income and peer group pressure. One principal stated that over 33 per cent of their students taking a gap year would not proceed to university. But, looking to the future, recent budget changes to remove the family assets test and the family actual means test and allow all family tax benefit children to be considered in the pool of eligibility will make it easier for a subset of my constituents who previously were ineligible for youth allowance.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my intention that the collated information from this forum, from the think tank and from individual submissions contribute to effecting change for our rural, regional and remote students who aspire to a tertiary qualification. I believe Ministers Pyne and Morrison will receive a final report on this Australia-wide consultation process later this year. I thank them in advance for collaborating to level the playing field for rural students compared with their metropolitan cousins.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I congratulate the attendees on their candour and their considered contribution to effecting change for future generations of regional students who wish to attain a tertiary qualification. Our kids are our nation's future. They deserve the best educational opportunities regardless of their postcode.
