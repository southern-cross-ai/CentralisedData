       <p>
        I rise to report on the recent opening of the Austin Cove Baptist College practical skills centre. Austin Cove is a primary to year 12 school located in South Yunderup in my electorate of Canning. Since opening in 2011, Austin Cove has grown significantly, drawing students from across the Peel region. It has a reputation for affordable private education that seeks academic and artistic excellence alongside a respect for Christian values. Such is the popularity of Austin Cove that the school has struggled to keep up with the demand of students. Officially opened on 9 March, the practical skills centre will further expand the school's capability. The centre includes science labs, preparation rooms and technical skills workshops in addition to conventional classrooms and staffrooms. This will help cater for students considering a profession in science and technology, as well as those seeking a trade apprenticeship. The centre was co-funded between the school and the Commonwealth, with $1.05 million provided by the Commonwealth government through its capital works program.

        I commend Principal Paul Venter, the college board and all the staff at Austin Cove for their commitment to the Peel region. This was again on display last Friday afternoon, when the school held a free community fair on its grounds, which I thoroughly enjoyed attending. Local institutions take years to build and can only be built with strong community support. I see evidence of such an institution in Austin Cove Baptist College and can say with confidence that the Commonwealth has helped fund a worthy contribution to local education.
