        Too often, the discussion regarding youth on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        is focused on challenges such as unemployment and mental health—and I have raised these important issues many times in this place. But today I take the opportunity to promote some of the fine young men and women who give the best to our community, from local sporting champions to members of the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee. I am proud to stand in this parliament and boast about the many academic, social and sporting achievements of young people who call the Central Coast their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The magnitude of talent amongst our youth was prominently displayed at the recent Wyong Shire Council Australia Day Awards ceremony. A record 11 nominees vied for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Award
        </a>
        , and many other young people found themselves nominated for categories including the Environmental, Sports Person and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Community Service
        </a>
        awards. Many of the nominees are active in our local community, taking up volunteer positions with local sports clubs and community committees, including Nathan Conner, a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DYAC" rel="nofollow">
         DYAC
        </a>
        , whose achievements I have previously had the pleasure of sharing with the parliament. I have worked closely with several of the nominees over the past 12 months and today I acknowledge their achievements.
       </p>

        Maddison O'Gradey-Lee was awarded the Wyong Shire Council Australia Day Youth Award. Currently completing year 12, Maddi is a member of Wyong council's Wyong Action Team, which is implementing the council's Youth Engagement Strategy. Maddi is currently developing a mental awareness program called 'It's all about me'. Maddi's aim is to break the stigma around youth mental health, and she hopes to let people know where to turn for help and how they can help others who are dealing with such issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another member of the Wyong Action Team is Rhys Reid, who has focused his efforts on making council's outdoor gyms accessible to young people. Rhys understands the benefits to physical and mental wellbeing stemming from an active and healthy lifestyle and is determined to spread this message far and wide.
       </p>

        Ethan Milne, Secretary of The Entrance District Cricket Club, was nominated for the Sports Person Award for his services to local sport. For the past 2½ years, Ethan has been instrumental in expanding the opportunity for members of the local community to participate in sport. His enthusiasm for the game of cricket and its contribution to a healthy and active lifestyle provides pathways for those members of the community looking to become involved. Ethan is also an active surf-lifesaver and gives his time throughout the summer to volunteer patrols. In addition to Ethan's outstanding contribution to local sport, he was a recipient of the Dr John Lincoln Youth Community Service Award for providing over 500 hours of community service in recent years.

        These are just some of the many examples of young people in my electorate who are achieving extraordinary things for their community. It is my pleasure to recognise, in the parliament today, these fine young adults, and I look forward to sharing many more of their achievements in the future.
