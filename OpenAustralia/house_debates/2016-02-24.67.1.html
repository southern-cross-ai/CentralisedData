            The member for Lilley is warned. I am going to address some remarks to all members—without interjections, if members wish to remain in the chamber. The level of noise, as I said, is now too high. It was too high yesterday. When I became Speaker, I said that the parliament should be a robust place. I also said that I would give a fair go to all but, in return, I wanted to see an improvement in the level of discourse. The Leader of the Opposition at that time made the point that it was a good time for all members to reflect on their behaviour, and he was right. There are many members who do not interject, and there are a large number who have not been sent out under 94(a). But there are some who have been frequently sent out. I accept, of course, from time to time there will be reactions and interjections—I am a realist—but continuing persistent interjections from those who have been continually ejected will not be tolerated. I want to give fair warning that I will be taking more severe action if necessary, which the standing orders allow.

               I am asked about who has supported this legislation. The member for Brand has rightly said in this place:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               It is self-evidently the case that our parliament needs to act on electoral reform.
              </p>
              <p>
               This parliament is seeking to do that through the bill brought forward by the government. The member for Brand said quite plainly that the counting of the ballot paper should reflect the intent of the voter and not the desire of ballot manipulators.

                 That is what the member for Brand, a former
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
                  Special Minister of State
                 </a>
                 , said. The member for Brand, unlike those opposite more generally, has been entirely consistent on this point. He said in February of this year:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 These reforms simply mean that political parties, including my own, will have to convince the public rather than backroom deal-makers that they deserve their votes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He is not alone, because the member for Bruce, who sat on the JSCEM committee, Mr Speaker, with you and did joint press conferences with you in relation to the unanimous recommendations of the JSCEM report, said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 The government should be acting on these recommendations and, if they're going to, they need to hurry up because they're running out of time.
                </p>

                 You would think that, with all of that support—from head office, from esteemed members of the opposition—the member for Brand, who has served as a Special Minister of State, would have got support in their party room. In fact, you can look at what some of them have said. The member for McMahon said this in December 2013:

                    Where was the member for McMahon when this matter was discussed? I understand the member for Isaacs and the member for Batman went to bat for the member for Brand, but those opposite decided to welch on the JSCEM report. It is clear that the Labor Party's real principle—that your vote is always safer in their hands rather than in your own—is alive and well with the spivs that are now running the Labor Party.
