       <p>
        It's always a pleasure to rise in this House and speak about our great electorates. Every single day, I reflect on the trust that has been placed on me by the electors of my community of Forde. I humbly acknowledge that trust. I know they trust me not to be distracted by the political push and shove that occurs in the cocoon of Canberra and that occurs on all sides of politics from time to time. Importantly, they want me to remain focused on the issues that concern them. I want to say to the people in my community of Forde that I am and always will be focused on working tirelessly on their behalf as a member of this government. We're getting on with the job of delivering a better Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Forde are hardworking, honest people who care about their families and their futures. They care about being safe and secure from threats, both locally and in Australia at large, which is why the coalition has secured our borders. We've stopped the boats. We've cancelled the visas of thousands of foreign nationals who have committed serious crimes. We will continue to defend Australian values and protect our way of life. We've also invested locally some $525,000 through our Safer Communities Fund for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras in Bethania, Loganholme and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Marsden State High School
        </a>
        , as well as a mobile safety camera vehicle for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City Council
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Forde want to keep more of their hard-earned cash, and I'm proud to say that some 74,000 taxpayers in the community of Forde will benefit from the low- to middle-income tax relief of up to $530 in the 2018-19 financial year. Importantly, we want people to have the dignity and self-respect that comes with having a job. The coalition government has seen the delivery of over a million jobs in our economy since we were elected. We are doing this by backing small business through our small- to medium-business tax cuts, which have helped some 15Â½ thousand of my local businesses invest, employ and pay their workers more.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Forde care about getting a bed in a good hospital if one of their family members gets sick. This is why the federal government has locked in a 34 per cent funding increase to public hospitals over the next five years in the Brisbane south metro region. This is on top of the money that has been poured into the Logan Hospital and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        University Hospital, both totalling over $1 billion over the last three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        People in my electorate care about their kids getting a good education. This government has focused on delivering that for the people of Forde. An extra $3.4 billion will go into schools in the electorate of Forde over the next 10 years to ensure they have the resources and capacity to ensure a bright future for our kids. Additionally, the people in my electorate of Forde want affordable child care. As of 2 July, some 8,900 local families in Forde have already started benefitting from our childcare reforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the people of Forde care about not sitting in endless traffic jams on the way to and from work each day. I've fought hard for the electorate of Forde over the last seven years to the extent that I've managed to secure $1.3 billion to upgrade the M1. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of my Gold Coast colleagues

        in the support for those M1 upgrades. I want to acknowledge, really, the whole of team Queensland; we've all worked together to achieve these for our communities. The M1, and particularly the M1/Gateway merge and the stretch from

         Eight Mile Plains
        </a>
        to Loganlea Road, is an issue that I know is close to the heart of my constituents, and I'm proud that I turned the first sod on this vital upgrade a month or so ago with my good colleague Karen Andrews, the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        . As this work is completed, it will see our families get home faster and sooner. People will be able to spend more time with their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's time for a reality check, to take a breath and to remember the coalition government is delivering on its commitments to live within its means, create a stronger economy for more jobs, keep our borders safe, guarantee essential services and encourage and reward hardworking Australians. It's with great pride that I am the member for Forde. I remain committed to and focused on representing the great people of my electorate in this House.
