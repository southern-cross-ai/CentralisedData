        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that Labor’s $30-a-tonne carbon tax could increase rail fares by up to $70 a year? Given that a carbon tax is meant to encourage people, not discourage people, from using public transport, how will the Prime Minister compensate state public transport authorities so that fares do not skyrocket as a result of her carbon tax?

           You can always rely on the shadow Treasurer for a bit of help. I thank him for that; he is much more supportive of me than he is of the Leader of the Opposition and he is being very supportive now! I thank the shadow Treasurer for absolutely admitting to this House that the opposition is predicating its questions on figures that it is just grabbing—that, of course, it is coming into this parliament to raise fear and, in order to do that, it is making things up. The question asked by the member is just about making things up.

I say to the member, who continues to float figures that she has just made up: how will she feel at the next election campaign when we have successfully priced carbon through this parliament? How will she feel at the next election campaign, when she is honour bound to go to every constituent in her electorate and say, ‘The assistance the Gillard government gave you,

                                  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 89, I think the words being used by the Prime Minister would be regarded as offensive words. We all know the connotation that the Prime Minister is trying bring about by using the word ‘denier’. We know that she is trying to allude to the Holocaust. It is offensive and it must stop.

                                    Mr Speaker, after 18 years in the Parliament I do not think there is anybody in this place who would ever accuse me of making light of the Holocaust or any issue to do with the state of Israel. I was 11 years as chairman of the Parliamentary Friendship Group on Israel. I make the connection between climate change denier and Holocaust denier. I find it offensive and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition finds it offensive, and in that spirit I would ask you to ask her to withdraw it.

                                     Order! If people want to personalise this, as a member of this House for 25 years, and in making my ruling earlier, I indicated that I was making that ruling with as much sensitivity as I could muster. No matter how my learned colleague the member for Sturt wants to put his case, I think that it is stretching the bounds of the way in which this House has conducted its business for a member to put his construction on a statement and forcing a withdrawal.

                                     I simply say to the House that, actually having come to this flashpoint, I would hope that members take a deep breath and behave in a manner that those who observe us from outside would expect. That would apply to both sides—actually turning down the heat and returning to the basics of what we are here for: that is, to debate the issues and not get into the personality clashes that we have seen over many question times. I conclude, regrettably, that we are judged on this hour and a half of our proceedings, and not on the cooperation that is seen about issues that are myriad—including the sensitive issue that I am being lectured upon by a member. The Prime Minister has the call.

                                        Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I simply refer the House to the Leader of the Opposition’s many past and completely contradictory statements on the question of accepting the climate change science. I also refer the House to the shadow Treasurer’s words from yesterday—facts that the member for Macquarie may be interested in, facts on Sky

                                        </i>
                                        , where he was asked by the host, ‘You’ll repeal the compensation?’ to which the shadow Treasurer said, ‘Of course.’ That is why I am putting to the member for Macquarie that, if we give tax cuts, you are committed to taking them away; if we give pension increases, you are committed to taking them away; and if we give direct payments then the Leader of the Opposition has committed you to taking them away. Be honest about that with your electorate.
