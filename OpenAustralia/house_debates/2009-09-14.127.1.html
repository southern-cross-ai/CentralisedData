        I rise today to speak on netball and in particular the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association. This association operates up at the Kingsway Regional Sporting Complex in the electorate of Cowan. For a long time they have been adding great value for the young women of the northern suburbs. In fact, I doubt whether any young lady from the northern suburbs of Perth would not be aware that the heart of netball is at Kingsway Regional Sporting Complex and the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association.

        My eldest daughter has participated in netball and, as we approach the spring season starting next month, I hope to have my 10-year-old and six-year-old daughters participating in this very fine sport. I understand that netball is the second biggest sport in Australia in terms of participants. That is a great example of what a great sport it is and how it is regarded by the people.

        On Saturday morning I was honoured to be able to attend the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association awards breakfast. I would like to acknowledge that, at that breakfast, the Spirit of Netball award was won by Irene McCoach, the Junior Spirit of Netball award was won by Sophie Ridley, the Rising Coach Award was won by Leanne Bruce and the Carol Horrocks Award, named after the inaugural president and life member of the association, was won this year by Lauren Bridges and Tracey Meade. I would also like to acknowledge the president and vice-president of the association, Joanne Clark and Peter Brems, and the board members of the association, Lauren Bridges,

        , Estelle Walker and Bev Hyde.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said before, this is the second biggest sport in Australia in terms of participants. A lot of teams participate in the association and literally hundreds of volunteers make sure that all of the teams can play on the weekends. We are talking about coaches, managers, umpires and club administrators. I would just like to say what a brilliant association they are and what great value they add for young women in the northern suburbs of Perth. It is a great honour for me to have them within the electorate of Cowan.
