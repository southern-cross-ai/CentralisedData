        I rise today to again speak about meningococcal disease, a disease that has had a strong effect on my community, particularly in the Riverland. Meningococcus is an acute bacterial infection that can cause death within hours if not recognised and treated in a timely fashion. Given the quick progression of the disease, early action and treatment are vital. Diagnosis can be challenging, however, because the symptoms are so similar to those for influenza.

        Jazmyn Parkyn was one such case. On the night of 25 August 2015, the usually bright three-year-old began showing flu-like symptoms including a high temperature. As Jazmyn's two older sisters had both recently had the flu, Jazmyn's parents, Sarah and Aaron, were not overly concerned until they noticed a strange rash the next morning across Jazmyn's legs. If it was not for Jazmyn's mother deciding to take her to the doctor, 'just to be sure', and subsequently the doctor recognising the symptoms and sending Jazmyn straight to the hospital, the outcome for Jazmyn may have been very different. By that afternoon, while being monitored in hospital, the rash had spread extensively over little Jazmyn's body. It took less than 24 hours for Jazmyn, a usually happy and healthy three-year-old, to become seriously unwell. Jazmyn was then airlifted to the Women's and

        in Adelaide.
       </p>

        Following this distressful event, the Parkyn family, along with other supporters in the community, have become instrumental in raising awareness of the disease across the Riverland,

        </a>
        and the nation more broadly. One such example is an event being held in Renmark on 2 April. The Parkyn family have organised Jazmyn's Fun Run to raise awareness of the disease. The event is a two-, five- or 10-kilometre run along the beautiful

        starting at Jarrett Memorial Gardens in Renmark. The Parkyn family are, as you have heard, staunch advocates for making the vaccine more accessible to familiesâ€”as am I. Indeed, I have spoken in this place on this topic before. I commend their dedication to raising awareness of the disease and their push to deliver vaccines to every Australian family. I hope to be there on 2 April to join in with the Parkyn family, although I do not normally associate running with fun! It might be hard to conceive, but I have even been to the gym and stepped up my game a little. I encourage all those in the Riverland to take a leaf out of my book and come along to see what a fantastic day this will be. Well done to the Parkyn family on organising this event and their campaign to raise awareness around meningococcal disease.
