       <p>
        I'm very pleased to rise to acknowledge the distinguished list of my constituents in Bradfield who were honoured in this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        list. I'm struck by the diversity of the contributions they have made to our nation and to their community. Let me start with Dr Catherine Foley AO,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSM" rel="nofollow">
         PSM
        </a>
        , honoured for her distinguished service to research science, the advancement of women in physics, and to professional scientific organisations. I should also note that Cathy Foley has made me welcome on a number of occasions to the

         West Lindfield
        </a>
        , where her passion, knowledge and leadership have been extensively demonstrated. She really is, I think, a very impressive role model for, in particular, young women interested in a career in science.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        acknowledge the Hon. Justice Derek Price AO, who received this award for his distinguished service to the law, and to the judiciary, in

         New South Wales

        , and through contributions to professional legal organisations. Also recognised were: Mrs Julie Fitzgerald AM, for her significant service to netball as a coach and as a mentor of sportswomen; Dr Jill Gordon AM, honoured for her significant service to psychological medicine and to professional medical bodies; Mr Peter Lancken AM, for his significant service to business, equipment hire and rental industry, and to the community; Mr Ian Langford-Brown AM, for his significant service to youth, through Scouts, and to the community of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore" rel="nofollow">
         North Shore
        </a>
        . As a Scout's parent, I've had the opportunity to see for myself what a wonderful contribution to the community and to the development of young people the Scouting movement makes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge Ms Ming Long AM, awarded for her significant service to the financial and real estate sectors, and to diversity and inclusion. I'm particularly pleased to mention Mr Ken Broadhead
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFD" rel="nofollow">
         RFD
        </a>
        for his service to the community. Ken has given me great support and assistance; he's served on a number of community committees that I have established. He's one of those people who you will see in one capacity or another at any community event you go to. I acknowledge Dr Emily Matters OAM, awarded for her service to education and professional associations; Dr Jenetta Russell OAM, for her service to the community and to businessâ€”and, again, I've enjoyed getting to know Jenetta well. And, finally, in the military division: Commander Richard Brickacek
