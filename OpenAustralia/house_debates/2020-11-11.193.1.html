        I wish to take this opportunity to speak about an important occurrence in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . I'm pleased to speak about the significant progress on an important water project in the region, Rookwood Weir. I'm happy to report that Commonwealth funds are now able to start flowing for this important project, after its funding agreement was signed off between the Australian and Queensland governments. The contracting of Rookwood Weir has been a long time in the making. The Queensland government have downsized the total capacity of the weir by almost 29 per cent, taking water directly out of the allocation meant for agricultural use. Water is the lifeblood of regional communities, and the agriculture industry relies on it to survive. This fact remains lost on the state government, which is focused on the south-east corner of the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hosted a rally last year in Rockhampton with landowners, graziers and farmers who were fed up with the Queensland government playing games with the total water capacity of the weir. Unfortunately, the Queensland government chose to ignore all of their voices and has proceeded with constructing a smaller weir. Even now it is still unknown what the total water capacity of Rookwood Weir is going to be. Farmers can't invest in water infrastructure and equipment on their own properties due to the uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Central Queensland has the potential to become one of Australia's premier supply centres for a huge range of agricultural product and produce. The region is a natural choice for a diverse range of agriculture investments. Through the development of Rookwood Weir, along with other projects, like the Connors River Dam, the region can further the agriculture industry's position as a major food bowl to benefit Central Queensland and the rest of Australia. The signing of this agreement demonstrates the great progress made by the federal government. Our commitment to investing in nationally important water infrastructure is stronger than ever.
       </p>

        I also wish to take the opportunity now, on

        , to pay tribute and acknowledge all service personnel, both past and present. Every one of us here today shares a great privilege. That privilege is that we get to live in a country of freedom and prosperity. However, it doesn't come free. Remembrance Day is a time for us, as a nation, to unite in a minute of reflection and solemn respect for those who served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. We pause to remember those who returned home, carrying with them the scars of their service, and the family members who cared for them. Many of these men and women went on to build this great nation through the 20th century. We pay particular attention to those currently serving in the

        and in peacekeeping operations. As a nation, we show our gratitude for the sacrifice of those who have bravely served and died. For a century we have remembered them, and we will ensure they are remembered still. Lest we forget.
