        Over the weekend it was a pleasure to attend the Edwardstown junior football club and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Park
        </a>
        football and netball club end-of-season events with my wife, Leanne. On Friday the Flinders Park football and netball club held their end-of-season ball in Glenelg, and the netballers were in full swing, celebrating their 2015 B-3 premiership. The C-graded footballers, unfortunately, lost the division 3 grand final in a low-scoring match, but it did not dampen their presentation ball. It was great to meet and speak with a number of players, volunteers, members and community people. It was wonderful to see the special acknowledgement for Trevor and Loretta, who sat at our table and helped out at the kitchen, bar and barbecue of the club. They are great members and supporters of the club.

        Congratulations to all award recipients as well as the A-grade players Brett O'Hara and Justin Keatley, who were selected in the 2015 division 3 team of the year. Thanks also to

        and Chairman Trevor for their hospitality as well as to Josh and Jess, who were the event organisers and did a terrific job.

        Yesterday I presented the Matt Williams Best and Fairest Award to the under-8s, 9s, 10s and 11s at the Edwardstown junior football club. What I was most impressed with was the celebration of improvement at lower age levels. The encouragement provided to the young future stars by the coaches was great to see and I wish them all the best for their future sporting endeavours. I would like to congratulate junior president Mark Vella, Brandon McNichol and Ben Kitto, and thanks to the number of parents and supporters who gave up so much of their time for the young players. As a proud supporter of both clubs, I look forward to seeing success in 2016.
