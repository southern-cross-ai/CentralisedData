       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge the 75th anniversary of a beloved Oxley community organisation: the Oxley Queensland Country Women's Association. This fantastic team of women has been serving our community for three-quarters of a century, including through fetes, raising money for charity and serving up some delicious cakes, all in the name of a good cause. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCWA" rel="nofollow">
         QCWA
        </a>
        connects women from all around our region and is defined by its dedication to empowering women and inspiring friendship through a connection to community and advocacy for important issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm honoured to be a supporter of an organisation with such a rich and inspiring history and have constantly been in awe of their dedication to our community. I want to acknowledge in particular, for almost 63 years of service, Mrs Jean Harrop of the Oxley QCWA. Jean first joined the association in 1958 in Inala before moving to Oxley when the Inala branch closed in 1972. During her leadership of the Oxley branch, it's become well known for its 'cent auctions', musical concerts and, of course, social inclusion, providing a popular social activity for many in the Oxley community. Regrettably, I cannot be with the Oxley branch today as they celebrate their birthday with a morning teaâ€”an event that I'm sure will be filled with good music, great food and an unmatched sense of pride in our community. Thank you to Belinda, Bronwyn, Sally, Pat, Gail and Lisa for all that you do and are doing to build this organisation into the future. I'm a proud supporter of you and the work that you do, and I look forward to many morning teas come.
