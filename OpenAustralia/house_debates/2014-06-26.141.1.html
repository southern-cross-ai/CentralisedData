        of Commerce and Industry of WA projects that the state will require an extra 488,500 workers in the decade leading up to 2020. Furthermore, analysis by the WA Department of Training and Workforce Development indicates that WA may experience a net shortfall of between 133,000 and 150,000 workers by 2017. Of all new jobs forecast to be created in the years leading up to 2017, 16.7 per cent of the new jobs are expected to be required in the mining and construction industries, with over 44 per cent of new jobs created in the retail, manufacturing, healthcare, education, training, professional, scientific and technical services industries. Recent research by the CCIWA also corroborates the forecast that WA is likely to experience a shortage of up to 210,000 workers by 2020.

       <p>
        To address the impending skills shortage, the Abbott government has an Economic Action Strategy to build our nation through the development of a skilled workforce. One such initiative is the Trade Support Loans program, which is an integral part of the government's collection of measures designed to provide wider opportunities for our young and mature-age people alike to study at university or complete vocational education and training and apprenticeships through student loans and scholarships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Trade Support Loans program, apprentices will be able to access concessional trade support loans of up to $20,000 to assist them in completing four-year apprenticeships. At a time when there is a shortage of skilled labour in certain industries, it is an important initiative by government to ensure that Australia develops the skilled workforce required. By becoming more self-sufficient in key industries, our nation will be less reliant on foreign skilled labour provided by overseas workers, such as those on 457 visas. Based on the current National Skills Needs List, there are 149,000 apprentices training in high-priority qualifications, with a further 70,000 commencing each year. It is forecast that 59,600 apprentices already in training will take up the loans from 1 July 2014, and between 35,000 and 42,000 new apprentices will join the program each year leading up to 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Moore, there are an estimated 1,329 apprentices currently in training and a significant talent pool of aspirational young people who will benefit by enrolling in a range of the vocational training facilities based locally. The West Coast Institute Trades North campus in Clarkson trains approximately 900 students each week in pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships and trades training in the areas of bricklaying, electrical work, metal fabrication, carpentry, tiling and plastering. The institute's main Joondalup campus delivers more than 130 different training qualifications ranging from certificate I to advanced diploma. In particular, the Academy of Hospitality and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_Arts" rel="nofollow">

        has partnered with Hospitality Group Training to deliver accelerated apprenticeships in commercial cookery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, the College of Electrical Training in Joondalup is operated by the National Electrical and Communications Association of WA with the capacity to train up to 1,000 apprentice electricians. The federal government provided a $2.7 million grant to build this training facility. Also located in Joondalup is the Motor Industry Training Association, which provides a range of automotive courses in mechanical repairs, electronic diagnostics, panel beating and spray painting. Catering for both light-passenger and heavy vehicles, the facility is operated by the Motor Trade Association of WA and provides a hands-on, practical learning experience for apprentices.
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary, the Trade Support Loans program represents just one aspect of the government's Economic Action Strategy to develop a skilled workforce that will drive the future economic development of our nation. It provides people with the opportunity to acquire skill, participate in the workforce and seek reward for their efforts.
