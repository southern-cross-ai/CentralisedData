        on Monday morning to be announced as representatives for Australia in the 2023 International Science Olympiad.

       <p>
        The International Science Olympiad serves as a platform to promote scientific education and foster international collaboration among young scientists. It encourages participants to excel in their scientific studies and pursue careers in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        fields. This year's Olympiad will include more than 1,900 students and 104 countries, all competing for the top prize. Henry will represent Australia in the earth sciences team, after winning his spot for a series of regional and national competitions. When asked about this achievement, Henry shared: 'It is surreal. I've never really done anything like that at all before, so it's a very exciting.' I first met Henry when he competed in my near-mythic bean-counting competition. Through the support for this type of initiative—the Olympiad, not by bean-counting competition!—the Albanese government is helping a new generation of young and talented Australians to hone their unique skills and abilities now, for the future benefit of Australia. Congratulations and good luck to Henry, as well as all the Australian students competing in the International Science Olympiad.

        Monday 12 June was the 125th anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the significance of this day and the invaluable contributions of the Filipino community here in Australia—the community of more than 400,000 that plays a substantial role right across this country. I would like to extend my gratitude to the Canberra Filipino community for the friendship and support they have shown me and my family. Their warmth, hospitality and unwavering commitment to our shared values have strengthened the bond between our nations and made our nations stronger. Australia's multicultural society thrives on the diversity and richness brought by different cultures, and the Filipino community has played an integral role in shaping our great society. It was great to come together last night with members of the community to celebrate the 161st anniversary of the birth of
