        showed what leadership looks like in a crisis. He unified West Aussies during their darkest days and saved thousands of lives. My community of Swan witnessed this firsthand.

        . Some might think an engineer is needed in parliament. WA Labor is awash with talent, and I know the new WA Labor premier will serve the state with diligence and compassion. I look forward to continuing to be a partner in Canberra and fighting for our fair share of the
