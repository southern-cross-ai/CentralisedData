         The answer to the honourable member's question is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. What steps has the Government taken to ensure the integrity of the next federal election.
        </p>

          Australian Government
         </a>
         is pursuing a range of initiatives to ensure the integrity of Australian elections is maintained, raise awareness of electoral security, and develop strategies to protect and maintain public confidence in our democratic process.

          ACSC
         </a>
         ) and National Cyber Security Adviser have delivered a series of briefings to relevant stakeholders to ensure political parties, governments and electoral commissions have a clear understanding of cyber threats to the electoral process. In February 2017, the ACSC provided a classified briefing to political party leaders on the cyber threat to the electoral process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Following this classified briefing, the National Cyber Security Adviser commenced a series of cyber security briefings to state and territory Cabinet members, parliamentarians, senior public servants and electoral bodies to assist them to better understand cyber security risks and take steps to mitigate vulnerabilities. The ACSC also delivered briefings to Tasmanian and

         has created a new National Counter Foreign Interference Coordinator to lead the development and implementation of a Whole-of-Government strategy that will bring together key policy, operational and social cohesion levers to respond to foreign interference. The National Counter Foreign Interference Coordinator will be a focal point for engagement with diaspora communities and sectors vulnerable to foreign interference.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Finally, the Australian Government has also made legislative amendments to improve the integrity of the electoral process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The
         <i>
          Electoral and Other Legislation Amendments Act 2017
         </i>
         , which came into force on 14 March 2018, and the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017 improve transparency and accountability around seeking to influence voters.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 will modernise and strengthen a number of existing criminal offences and will introduce a range of foreign interference offences. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 was also introduced to establish a foreign influence transparency scheme to provide visibility of the nature and extent of foreign influence over Australia's political and governmental processes.

This health check will provide a high level review of both governance and technical cyber security health, enabling electoral commissions, governments and risk holders to better understand the maturity of their cyber security risk management processes and provide a baseline for improvement into the future.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In the lead up to both the Tasmanian and South Australian elections, the ACSC also provided individual briefings to each commission on the importance of cyber security and the help available to them in the event of an incident.
