        I rise today to speak about two local women in my electorate who are doing amazing things to raise awareness about breast cancer. And they're not just raising awareness; they're actually getting women and sufferers real information that is useful. Katrina and Amy—Katrina Houghton being a friend I've known since the time I was elected—came to the idea of an organisation called Know Your Knockers. After Katrina was diagnosed with breast cancer, they thought, 'We need to provide women with more information.' Katrina says she was devastated and virtually went from coffee dates with friends one day to chemotherapy the next. What she discovered on her journey was a need for more information and support for sufferers to navigate the world of breast cancer, and so the Know Your Knockers booklet—this little pink booklet—was created.
       </p>
       <p>
        A 79-page guide to everything breast cancer related, the booklet features

        advice about where to begin following a diagnosis; hair loss, headwear and wig information; honest recounts about mastectomy surgery; and advice about dealing with chemo. Having gone through the process herself, Katrina understands the impact of helpful and friendly advice from like-minded people and will be distributing the booklet throughout South-East Queensland hospitals for local women, men and their families to use as something to turn to in need. The booklet also details many stories from local experts on what to expect when going through breast cancer.

        The Morrison government has made a massive contribution in relation to cancer sufferers and their families. Since coming to government in 2013, we have made many developments to improve the lives of patients, such as listing new treatments on the PBS, including Kisqali and Ibrance. These medications are used for the treatment of hormone receptor breast cancer, one of the most common forms of breast cancer and the most fatal. Now they are more affordable and more available for everyone to use. When used in conjunction with others, these medications have the ability to slow the growth of tumour cells and the progression of breast cancers in some patients. Without the PBS subsidy, it could cost patients up to $55,000. We've also invested $32 million to give breast cancer patients access to life-saving

        and PET scans under Medicare. From 1 November 2019, these services are expected to benefit more than 14,000 patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Katrina and Amy, for the Know Your Knockers booklet. It will help many people.
