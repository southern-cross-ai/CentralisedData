       <p>
        There are currently 435 children in immigration detention in Australia: 327 on the mainland and 108 on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        and Cocos Keeling Island. There are also 167 children in detention on Nauru. The reports from immigration detention centres show an environment of distress and despair, where mental health issues are rife. Children who have fled circumstances of fear and trauma now witness adults at the end of their wits, at the end of hope, who practice self-harm or attempt suicide. It is no surprise, but it should be shocking to know that children in our care are repeating those behaviours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Immigration detention is inflicting immeasurable harm on people who will be Australian residents and citizensâ€”on our future teachers, nurses, sports-people and business owners. In their most formative years, we are showing these children cruelty instead of kindness. We are deliberately denying them opportunity where we should be fostering their growth in keeping with our core values. Our approach to children in detention is unacceptable. I wholeheartedly endorse both the Love Makes a Way campaign and the new campaign by a number of prominent Australians called We're Better Than This.
       </p>
       <p>
        The truth is we are better than keeping children in detention. We should be doing everything in our power to reduce the suffering of children who have escaped danger and persecution, not making it worse. There are sensible, credible, compassionate alternatives, and we are creative and resourceful enough to find and apply those alternatives. I believe that this cruel and inhumane policy needs to end as a matter of urgency and I support all efforts that will help make this happen.
