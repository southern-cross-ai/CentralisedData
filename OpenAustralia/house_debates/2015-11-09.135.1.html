        Volunteers do not help out because they want thanks or reward; they do it because of a desire to be part of their community, and to provide opportunities for others in schools, community groups, sporting clubs and churches. More than six million Australians generously volunteer their time, energy and expertise each year and, through more than 730 million hours of unpaid work, provide an estimated benefit to the Australian economy of $16 billion.

        I want to congratulate 41 volunteers in the Blair community.

        , I had the pleasure of hosting the 2015 Blair Volunteer Awards, where we recognised the outstanding contribution of many individuals. There were 11 volunteer category winners and over 30 outstanding volunteers who have given of their time to the community, and they were recognised as well. I want to name a number of them and speak briefly about them.

        Alice Metz was a very worthy recipient of the 2015 Blair Volunteer Junior Award. She is an exceptional young person, who gives generously of her time. She is involved in the Air Force Cadet Program at the

       <p>
        Reg Tohia was the very popular winner of the 2015 Blair Volunteer Education Award. Reg, a Maori elder, is a beloved figure at my old high school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundamba_State_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Bundamba State Secondary College
        </a>
        , where he has volunteered for 13 years. He was nominated by Bundamba principal, Kathy Morrison, who attended the awards ceremony together with other school staff. Kathy says Reg volunteers the same hours each week to the college as a full-time teacher and that his role in the P&amp;C has been critical. He also represents the community at Anzac Day services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, Steph Shannon
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        received the award that I personally chose: the 2015 Blair Volunteer MP Award. Steph is an amazing person. She retired from her career as paediatric nurse after 47 years and now volunteers about 20 hours each week to help grieving children at Hilda's House at Ipswich Hospice Care. She was instrumental in steering the hospice's kids' grief group where she has helped hundreds of children and their families on their grief journey. After Steph spoke at the awards ceremony, there weren't many dry eyes in the room, I can say. Ipswich Hospice director Wendy Bryce nominated Steph saying that the most common description of Steph is simply 'an inspiration.' She is a worthy winner.

        Congratulations to all those people whose service and commitment have improved our local community.
