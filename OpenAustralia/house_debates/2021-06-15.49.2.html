         Acting Prime Minister

        . The government has kept four-year-old Tharnicaa in detention most of her young life. The Biloela community, I know, has made it clear that they want Tharnicaa's family to come home. Why won't the government let this family go home to Bilo?

         These matters in relation to immigration are never easy. They are difficult. They are complicated. The minister for immigration has made a statement this morning to ensure that the support and that the health outcomes for the family will be there in Perth for them. Indeed, we will continue to support the family. But I note that the opposition leader asked the question. It was not asked by others, and it well could have been. It was not asked by the member for McMahon—

          Member for Newcastle! No, none of you are going to warm up with interjections. You're not. If you've forgotten what happened the last time we sat, it shows you really haven't learnt anything. I just say to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
           Acting Prime Minister
          </a>
          that the question from the Leader of the Opposition was very specific and it didn't ask about alternatives. But I'll listen to him. I just caution him in that regard.

           Today the immigration minister exercised his power under section 197AB of the Migration Act to make a residence determination to allow the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan" rel="nofollow">
            Sri Lankan
           </a>
           family currently held in detention to reside in the Perth community. In making this determination, he balanced the government's ongoing commitment to strong border protection processes—and there is a process that is being worked through, and I appreciate there is still a legal process which is being worked through with this family. But we are providing the humanitarian support. We are providing the necessary health support. We are providing the necessary economic support. It is a bit rich, and I will not be lectured by Labor, who, on their watch, put 8,500 children in detention—8,500 in detention—as part of nearly 50,000 people who arrived on boats, on 800 boats. I will not take lectures. I was here when, sadly, people who tried that risky voyage were dashed up against the rocks and did not survive. We do not know how many people lost their lives attempting to make that risky voyage. Labor put more beds in detention centres than they ever did into hospitals in the medical system.

             In making this determination, the minister for immigration has balanced all of these things. These are, as I say, very difficult and emotional circumstances, and I do appreciate that. The family will now reside in suburban Perth, through a community detention placement, close to schools, close to support services, whilst the youngest child receives medical treatment from the nearby Perth Children's Hospital and as the family pursues ongoing legal matters.
