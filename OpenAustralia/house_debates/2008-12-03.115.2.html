         <p>
          Mr Speaker, I ask you to urgently investigate the circumstances around the taking of a photograph by the member for Dawson on the grounds of the parliament earlier today. The photo, which appears on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Ltd" rel="nofollow">
           News Ltd
          </a>
          website, is attributed to the Labor member for Dawson,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bidgood" rel="nofollow">
           James Bidgood
          </a>
          . The photo is of a man who had doused himself in petrol and threatened to set himself alight. This incredibly disturbing image provided by the member of parliament to the media outlet raises a number of very alarming issues. I ask you to investigate immediately all the circumstances surrounding the capture of the photo by the member for Dawson and the provision of that photo to the media.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition, I ask you to specifically advise the House whether the photo was sold by the member for Dawson to that media outlet. Further, I ask you to advise the House whether there have been any further breaches of security by the member for Dawson, whether he has abused the entitlements of his office as a member of parliament and whether there has been any other conduct totally unbecoming of a member of this parliament in relation to this tasteless matter. Finally, I ask you to report urgently back to the parliament following an immediate investigation of this repugnant event. I seek leave to table the report captured by News Ltd and the photo taken by Mr Bidgood.
         </p>
         <p>
          Leave granted.

           Mr Speaker, on indulgence: this afternoon at an event I took photographs of a serious incident. I later passed those photographs to a news organisation in return for a donation to charity connected to disabilities. My actions were highly insensitive and inappropriate. I am tonight writing a letter of apology to the family involved. I deeply regret my actions and I apologise once again for any offence that I have caused.

            First of all, I thank the member for

             North Sydney
            </a>
            for indicating to me that he was going to raise this matter. I have not had sufficient time to give consideration to the possible actions that I can take. Intuitively, my immediate reaction is that I do not think that I have a power of inquiry, but I do not want to be definitive about that at this stage. I hope the member for North Sydney will be happy if I consider what possible actions I can take in cognisance of what he has put to me and in cognisance of what the member for Dawson has put by way of response. This is in no way a definitive statement, and I apologise for that. The best way of handling this is to at least consider it in a proper way, trying to lessen any emotional attachment to the question that has been put to me. The thing that I am clear in my own mind about is that this is yet another reminder that it is probably time that this House considers a code of conduct.

              I simply say to the Manager of Opposition Business that that is why I am not being pre-emptive and giving any final pronouncements about this matter, because I understand that that point is one that would be put to me. I am just saying that intuitively I have problems about what the next course of action is. That is why I would prefer to be able to go away and consider this properly. It is not in any way a delaying tactic.

               I understand that. But we want to know all the circumstances surrounding the capture of that photo and the provision of that photo to the media from this House. We want to know whether the camera used was an electorate camera or a
