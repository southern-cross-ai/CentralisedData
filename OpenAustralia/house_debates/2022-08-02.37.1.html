        Almost two weeks ago the Karoonda East Murray community lost a great gentleman. Kevin John Burdett
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was born and lived his whole life in the Karoonda East Murray district. A true community leader, a farmer, a family man, Kevin served on many local organisations including the Karoonda Area School; the Karoonda Perponda and Copeville sports clubs, the Karoonda bowling club, the Karoonda and District Historical Society, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the Karoonda Farm Fair Committee, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        and the Karoonda Lions Club. In 2015 he was rightfully recognised for community services as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        program. Kevin was also a returned serviceman, having served his country in Vietnam.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first got to know Kevin in his role as mayor of the district council of Karoonda East Murray. First selected in 1995, he was appointed deputy mayor the same year. He was elected to the position of mayor in 2000 and continued uninterrupted in that role for 18 years. After stepping down as mayor, despite his health challenges, Kevin continued as an active elected member on council. Last year he received his 25-year service award from the local government association.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kevin was a man of faith. He had a wickedly dry wit and an innate ability to strike up a conversation with anyone. Everything Kevin did was about improving the lives of those living in the Karoonda East Murray community and his community is better for his contribution to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        My deepest condolences to his wife, Robyn; his three children and his 10 grandchildren. Vale Kevin Burdett OAM.
