         I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, in accordance with the project intent and contract with the Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division, the Pheasant Wood site has now been closed. Last Friday, on 13 June, a ceremony was held to acknowledge the significance of the ground and to allow the local community to pay respects to those Australian and British soldiers who have lain buried at this site since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fromelles" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Fromelles
         </a>
         in July of 1916. The ceremony was attended by representatives of the British government; the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         ; His Excellency Mr David Ritchie, the Australian Ambassador to France; the

          Commonwealth War Graves Commission
         </a>
         ; and the local community. It was also attended by Madame de Massiet, the landowner, who, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, has offered to gift the land in which these fallen soldiers lie to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission—a gesture which I believe all of us in this place are grateful to acknowledge and which I am sure we would all thank her for.

          Moreover, it is a mark of respect typical of the people of France for the loss of so many Australian lives at the time in defending their homeland. The ceremony has also marked the successful completion of the excavation. GUARD was commissioned, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, to confirm the presence or otherwise of human remains at the site; to determine, if possible, the nationality of those remains; to estimate their number; and, finally, to assess their condition. All of these purposes have been achieved. In fact, along with the discovery of the remains in six of the eight burial pits that were excavated, the archaeological team has located numerous
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
           First World War
          </a>
          artefacts, amongst them Australian Rising Sun collar badges and two British General Service buttons. This is sufficient for GUARD to confirm that Australian and British soldiers killed at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fromelles" rel="nofollow">
           Battle of Fromelles
          </a>
          on 19 July 1916 are present in the pits—that is, that they were never recovered during the 1920s and have remained undisturbed for those 92 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number of individuals buried at the site may be as high as several hundred, although we await the detailed report due from the archaeologists to give us a more accurate assessment of the figures. I would point out that this exploratory excavation only exposed 20 per cent of the surface area of each pit, which measure 10 metres by 2.2 metres. It was never intended to be an exhumation. I need to make that very clear. As a result of the nature of the excavation, none of the remains were disturbed in any way.
         </p>
         <p>
          As to what is to happen next, the future of the site—the future of these fallen Australian heroes, who have so long lain unacknowledged on French soil—is not a decision for us alone. We cannot act unilaterally. We need to be mindful of our obligations and mindful that British remains also rest at Pheasant Wood. Future decisions on possible identification and commemoration of remains will be made in agreement with the French and British governments and in consultation with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Commonwealth War Graves Commission
          </a>
          pursuant to a 1951 treaty.
         </p>
         <p>
          I should point out that since 1917 the policy of member nations of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has been that, if remains from the two world wars are recovered, they are buried in the closest Commonwealth war grave. I have already spoken twice to the British Under-

          , and will continue to work with him and his government through the next steps. I also know and fully appreciate the incredible interest that so many families hold in this site—families who have long wondered about the fate of their uncles, their grandfathers, their great-grandfathers and their great-uncles. I can assure those families that their interests will figure highly as the governments talk and as we study the technical assessment which has been undertaken by GUARD once we have received it.
         </p>
         <p>
          We all know—and this House certainly knows—that this discovery at Fromelles is momentous. Already, the site has received several significant visitations from people travelling to Fromelles. I point to the Minister for Trade, who visited the site a week or so ago; as well as the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard; and the British minister to whom I have referred, Derek Twigg. I want to publicly commend everyone whose professionalism and dedication have brought us to this point. The work, by its very nature, has been very difficult in the muddy conditions and—I have to say—very emotionally draining on all those involved, particularly the excavation team and the Australian project team. I want to again in this place thank Major General Mike O’Brien, who has coordinated the Army effort over the past weeks. It would be remiss of me if I did not commend again the tireless efforts of Mr Lambis Englezos and his supporters for their dedication in finding the missing at Fromelles. We are all very much indebted to them all. In conclusion, it is worth pointing out that, as a result of the work of Mr Englezos and his relationship with the community at Fromelles, on the anniversary of the battle—on 19 July this year—a replica of Cobbers, a statue at Fromelles, will be unveiled at the shrine in Melbourne. That will be an event of significance, I am sure you will agree. I will keep the House updated as the scientific reports and intergovernmental negotiations continue.
