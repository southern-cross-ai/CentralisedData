       <p>
        I rise to bring the attention of the parliament to the outstanding achievements of the Farnham Street Neighbourhood Learning Centre, located within my electorate of Melbourne. The Farnham Street Neighbourhood Learning Centre has been operating for 35 years, having first opened in 1979 as the Flemington Neighbourhood House. The centre arose as an initiative of the women of Flemington as a means of providing courses and activities for the local community. Over the last 35 years, Farnham Street has provided a range of community activities, programs and courses promoting inclusion, participation and educational opportunities for the diverse Flemington community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people have contributed to the success of Farnham Street, and I acknowledge the work of the centre's staff, committee members, volunteers, students and local residents without whom Farnham Street would not be possible. In particular, I would like to recognise the outstanding contribution of Cathy Connop, the manager of Farnham Street Neighbourhood Learning Centre. This year marks 25 years of outstanding service by Cathy to the community through the Farnham Street centre. The centre has become the vibrant and important community institution that it is because of Cathy's work. Cathy's service reflects the important values of community connection, participation and lifelong learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the federal member for Melbourne, it is with great pleasure that I acknowledge Cathy's tireless work and the difference that it has made to so many people in my electorate. Cathy and her team have always made me feel welcome, every time I have visited, and I have seen firsthand just how she and her team make people in our diverse community feel included.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my congratulations to the Farnham Street community and look forward to many more years of successful community service.
       </p>
