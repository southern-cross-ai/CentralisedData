        On 15 August this year, Australia commemorated 75 years since the end of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . Some one million Australians served in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , one of whom was my maternal grandfather,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dashwood" rel="nofollow">
         George Dashwood
        </a>
        . Tragically, 39,000 lost their lives and some 30,000 Australians were taken as prisoners of war. I commemorated this significant milestone at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track_Memorial_Walkway" rel="nofollow">
         Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway
        </a>
        , in Reid, which is located next to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_Repatriation_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Concord Repatriation General Hospital
        </a>
        , a hospital with a rich history and deep connection to the veteran community, not just in Reid but across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . It was a sombre day of remembrance but also a day of great pride as we acknowledged the sacrifices made to protect the freedoms of all Australians. Remarkably, 12,000 veterans are still with us. Two of these veterans, Mr Reg Chard and Mr Lloyd Birdsall, who are among the last surviving Kokoda veterans, are my local constituents and they were present at the service. I was deeply moved and honoured to speak with them and hear their experiences and see their ongoing commitment to the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say that the Morrison government is supporting the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway by committing $266,000 over three years to support the ongoing maintenance of this incredibly important site. This is something that I have fought for in collaboration with the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway board. I would like to thank the chair, Ms Jennifer Collins, the deputy chair, Miss Carole Anne Priest, the honorary secretary, Ms Alice Kang, and members of the board, for their ongoing commitment to the memorial. This funding is in addition to a $95,000 Saluting Their Service grant, which was for a virtual history project that will preserve our veterans' history and ensure that our veterans are never forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal note, I feel a great sense of connection to the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway. Not only does it signify what it means to be Australian, but I often go through the walkway on my morning jogs and I have taken my children through the memorial many times to teach them about the remarkable generation that served and protected our nation. It is a place of great reflection and an important place for learning. I am honoured to have this important site in Reid and will continue to advocate for its ongoing preservation so that the stories and sacrifices of our veterans are never forgotten.
