        As a former volunteer firefighter with a 12-year badge, I know the importance of the Australian Fire Services Medal. A local long-serving member of the Korumburra fire brigade was recognised on the

        . Billy, as he is known, was presented with the Australian Fire Services Medal. The medal recognises distinguished service by members of Australian fire services, especially volunteers. The AFSM, as it is known, award citation for Bill Rodda read:

       <p class="italic">
        Mr Rodda has given exemplary service to the

        </a>
        … after joining the Korumburra Fire Brigade in 1974. His outstanding dedication and commitment are exemplified by his contribution to the safety and welfare of the community, by his leadership and support of the volunteer culture in general through his involvement as the leader of the Korumburra Brigade over a considerable period of time, and by his active representation of volunteers at the state level as a member of the governing body of the (then) Victorian Urban Fire Brigades Association, now known as the Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria.

        Mr Bill Rodda has served the fire brigade in Korumburra for 37 years. Mr Rodda is a Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria district 9 president, and captain of his local brigade for 25 years. When told of his award, he commented, 'I am very honoured and shocked. I did not know that I would be considered good enough. For someone like myself, when you retire the

        At a recent joint presentation dinner on 7 May, operations manager
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Jones

        presented 755 years worth of service awards to volunteers. He recognised the members and the employers who supported those volunteers as well as the members who are self-employed and the partners of those volunteers—and Maureen Rodda is one of those amazing women who support the Bill Roddas of this world. Bill was as surprised as several other members present that night when he presented two life memberships to two very surprised members of his local brigade: one to Don Allan, district group officer with the Leongatha Korumburra group, and one to
