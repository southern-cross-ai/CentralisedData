       <p>
        Yesterday, the government moved forward with its ridiculous plan to make life harder for prospective university students and graduates. At a time when our economic future depends on a smarter, better trained workforce, at a time when we should be working to reduce inequality and to improve access to education, this government has decided to whack low-income Australians. While it remains committed to giving away $17 billion to profitable banks and multinationals, it's put the squeeze on younger Australians and people who are seeking to retrain in the face of a changing jobs environment.
       </p>

        When
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS
        </a>
        was introduced in 1990, the repayment threshold was $22,000. That was 73 per cent of average male earnings at the time. Now this Turnbull government has decided to drop the current threshold from $55,000 to $45,000, which is less than 60 per cent of average earnings. This change will likely have a particular effect, a particular impact, on women, who are already disadvantaged by the gender pay gap and who, in the case of single mums, will be dealing with a combined sharp impact of marginal tax rates and reduction in family support. That means that some women will know that, if they earn one dollar more than $45,000, they will instantly be worse off.
