        It is a sad fact that 41 per cent of contested family law matters involve domestic violence. Over 80 per cent of Federal Circuit Court matters involve family law matters. Against this background, I am asking for the support of every parliamentarian to resolve the stand-off, the crisis, in the appointment of new family Federal Circuit Court judges at the Wollongong registry. Right now, the Wollongong family law docket, excluding divorce matters, has in excess of 590 matters. This is an increase of 20 per cent in the last 12 months alone with no changes in the resources allocated to the registry.

It is not unusual for a matter to lie two or three years before it gets a final hearing.
