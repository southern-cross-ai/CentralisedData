        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on how the Morrison government is working with the business community to support our economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic?

         I thank the member for Higgins for her question and note her experience as a professor, as a paediatrician. She's published more scientific papers than I've published op-eds.

           I knew the Prime Minister wouldn't believe that. But, on a serious note, yesterday the people of Victoria got some very tough news, with the extension of lockdown No. 6 for an extra week. The people of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           today got some tough news, with a lockdown for a week. We are working with the business community, with the state and territory governments, with respect to economic support. Today we have announced, in partnership with the Victorian government, a new support package of $367 million for small and medium-sized businesses. Hairdressers, gyms, cafes and restaurants will all be eligible to receive payments that will range from $2,800 up to $20,000 for large hospitality venues. This brings to more than $1.1 billion the amount that we have committed, with the Victorian government, in just the last two weeks to support small and medium-sized businesses. I acknowledge the comments today from Victoria's Minister for Industry Support and Recovery, who said: 'We are very grateful for the ongoing spirit of cooperation in which the Commonwealth is approaching the matter of business and income support, and it allows us to provide the package we are announcing today.'
          </p>
          <p>
           With respect to the ACT, both the Prime Minister and I have spoken to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
            Chief Minister
           </a>
           today, and we are looking to provide support to businesses here in the ACT as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           With respect to the partnership with the business community, we know that the banks have provided loan deferrals and, since the recent lockdowns began, an extra 15,000 home mortgages have had deferrals. More than a thousand business loans have also been deferred.
          </p>
          <p>
           With respect to the vaccine rollout, General Frewen and I and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
            Chief Medical Officer
           </a>
           met with senior business leaders to enlist them in our vaccination tasks. We now have two of our major banks with pilot vaccination hubs in Sydney
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
            LGA
           </a>
           s. We also have Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and Metcash providing vaccinations in partnership with the governments through those distribution centres. We know that businesses have also been enlisted to encourage their staff and, indeed, their customers to get the vaccination. I was speaking to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of Coles today, who has written to more than 110,000 of their staff encouraging them to get the vaccination.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is another

           moment. Just as it was last year, it is again todayâ€”the Morrison government and state and territory governments working together with the business community.
