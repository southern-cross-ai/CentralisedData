        My question is to the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care. Does the minister accept that the sorts of abuses that were screened last night on

        were occurring when he was rejecting the calls for a royal commission? Minister, what has changed?

         I thank the member for Franklin for her question. When I was interviewed on
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners" rel="nofollow">
           Four Corners
          </a>
         </i>
         , I did indicate that I had not supported a royal commission at that point. I also indicated that we were undertaking significant reforms with the legislation we were passing through the chamber in respect to the quality commission. I also then received information from my own agency. The information from the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency provided detail on the number of complaints, which has risen significantly, but they also raised an issue that was absolutely important. That issue was the serious risks found. In the first year, there were only two. In the second year, there were 22. In the third year, there were 61. When you get information like that, you drill down on and you seek the information on what those important matters are. In looking at that, I then spoke with the Prime Minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         On that basis, as we all do when we have the right evidence and the right information, we have an obligation to change our mind. I changed my mind on the basis that I care about senior Australians and I want them cared for in aged care. Whilst we can politic, the bottom line is senior Australians. If they are at risk and if they are in crisis because they're not being cared for, then we have a problem. I'm talking about individuals. The other point that I want to make very clear is that up to 40 per cent of senior Australians in aged care do not have a single visitor 365 days of the year. Who looks after them? What I want is to make sure that with our government we get to the bottom of the issues that are not right. This royal commission will do that, so we should not pre-empt the work of the royal commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will continue to make the reforms that we are working on closely with the sector. We are working closely in co-designing and developing the responses. We're bringing the sector with us. Yesterday, I engaged with the Aged Care Sector Committee for some period of time to talk to them about the raft of issues. This morning, the Prime Minister and I met with the Aged Care Sector Committee and David Tune. We sought from them their views and advice on a range of issues. They have acknowledged and welcomed the royal commission. I will continue to consult, along with Minister Hunt, with key providers whose advice we will seek, because we intend to make sure that the quality and safety of senior Australians is cared for.
