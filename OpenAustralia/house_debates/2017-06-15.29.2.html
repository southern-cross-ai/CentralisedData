        I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Greg Hirst. He was a husband and father, a media personality, a pillar of the motorcycle community and a fierce advocate for the vulnerable. There were many, like me, who called him a friend. Greg was never far from his motorbike. If you saw Greg, there was a bike. He co-founded the Brotherhood Christian Motorcycle Club in 1979.

        he advocated for motorcycle safety and the civil rights of motorcyclists. For several years I jumped on the back of Greg's bike at

        Greg was a man of great heart, and as a devout Christian his life's work was to minister to some of the most vulnerable people through the Street Level Ministry. You could get a sense of Greg's generosity through his writing for

On Monday the Brotherhood Christian Motorcycle Club and many others will join Greg for one last ride as they escort him to the funeral service in Penrith, coming together for one last ride for Greg. Farewell, Hirsty.
