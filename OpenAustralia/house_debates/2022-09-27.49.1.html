         I thank the member for her question on what is a very serious matter and one that is causing anxiety for millions of Optus customers today. The truth is that what has occurred over the last week has been a wake-up call for corporate Australia. From the moment, last Wednesday, that it became clear that a breach had occurred, the government, through the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the Australian Signals Directorate, has been working hand in glove with Optus with a view to minimising the impact of the breach but maximising the protection of the customers who have found their privacy breached as a result of what has occurred. We continue to work with Optus to make sure that that protection can be maximised. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

         right now are doing everything within their power to pursue the criminal investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what's really important for those Optus customers is the steps that they take now in terms of their own security. It is really important that people do not click on links. It is really important that people check the sources of websites. It's really important that, in having phone conversations, people do not divulge their personal information unless they are 100 per cent confident about the circumstances in which that conversation is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will be continuing to work very closely with Optus and, indeed, other companies in the telecommunications sector and other sectors within the economy, including the banks, to make sure that we can do everything to minimise the impact of what has been a very concerning event. But it has been a wake-up call for corporate Australia. Cybersecurity is now right up there in the top echelon of issues which face corporate Australia, as it does government, of course. We need to be doing everything we can to make sure that protection is in place, and that will be the entire focus of this government.
