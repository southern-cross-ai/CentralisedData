        is an inspiration in our community. Thirty years ago, Peter had a serious motorcycle accident which resulted in the loss of his lower leg, along with other serious injuries. This, however, has not stopped him from accomplishing many outstanding achievements. He has held several Australian weightlifting records and won several international medals in the sport. Peter also currently holds two Australian national sport-fishing records. In 1998, he caught a 53-kilo black marlin and, in 2001, a 73-kilo striped marlin. Both records are held in the handline tackle category. He has also recently become a black belt in karate. He's also a qualified marine boat rescue skipper and has qualifications in marine trimming and carpentry and is also a qualified coxswain. He is also a medallist in the sport of dragon boats, which he started as a family sport with his wife, Angela, and two children, Molly and Ben. His wife, Angela, nominated Peter to participate in the upcoming

        , it is yet another milestone to celebrate for Peter. Peter pays tribute to Angela for her steadfast support. I congratulate Peter on all his achievements and wish him the best.
