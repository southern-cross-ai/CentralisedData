       <p>
        Today I would like to talk about the positive outcome being achieved in my electorate of Indi by the network of community banks. These branches, while they are franchises with great support by Bendigo and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Bank
        </a>
        , are locally owned and operated by their communities, all with their own volunteer board of directors. In Indi, I have the privilege of having community banks in Bright, Mansfield,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Beauty" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Beauty
        </a>
        , Beechworth and Yea. All are making valuable contributions to their communities through the support of groups, clubs, festivals, events and projects, often in partnership with local government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bright Community Bank was established in 2006 and has contributed over $220,000 to the community, including their recent partnership with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Shire" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in establishing the Bright Splash Park as part of the redevelopment of the

       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to acknowledge Branch Manager Mark Ditcham—hello Mark—his staff and board members

         Mark Howard

        , Jan Vonarx, Stuart Hargreaves, Geoff Tually, Leigh Marlow and Ros Holland for their contribution to their community. The Bright branch was the winner of the Award for Excellence and
