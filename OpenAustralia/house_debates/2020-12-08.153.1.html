        Earlier this year I was given the incredible, unique and unexpected opportunity when the Queensland state Labor government rejected the $195 million allocated for stage 2 of the Haughton pipeline. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer both agreed the funding would stay exactly where it should: with the wonderful people of Townsville. I thank them both for their support.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the chamber may recall, I formed an expert panel of independent Townsville business leaders, the Community Projects Advisory Committee, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to advise the government on projects which could be funded by the $195 million. As our city looked to economic recovery following COVID shutdowns and the 2019 flood event, it was vital to invest in projects and infrastructure that would support and grow the region for generations to come. Between August and November this year, CPAC undertook a very deliberate and transparent assessment of materials provided to it by the community. They received briefings from civic, community and business leaders and pored over business cases for many projects. I would like to personally thank every person and organisation that submitted a proposal. Your passion, dedication and commitment to Townsville and

        will keep our region in good stead for many decades to come.

        Narrowing down a short list was difficult, to say the least. The committee considered the projects against the Townsville City Deal framework, together with an assessment as to where the projects were, whether they were supported by a sound business case, whether they were achievable and deliverable in a timely manner, and whether they were capable of leverage and catalytic in attracting private investment, jobs and growth. These criteria have allowed the nomination of a short list of seven projects, which have now been sent to the minister for consideration. In the interest of not pre-empting or undermining the minister's decision-making process, I will not name the projects here today, but what I will say is that I'm incredibly excited at the thought of each project which has been shortlisted and its potential long-term benefit to the people of Townsville. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the volunteer members of the CPAC: the chair, Stephen Motti, who is the owner of Brazier Motti and has been instrumental in the drafting of the city deal; Ross McClennan, business owner and

        Partners, who is a Townsville Economic Development Strategic Advisory Committee member. I sincerely thank these community leaders for their love and passion of Townsville. That's always been at the forefront of all they do. Now it's over to you, Minister. No pressure.
