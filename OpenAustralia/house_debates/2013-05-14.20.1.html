        She was wonderful to work for, even though she was demanding. If you put a policy proposal to her she would raise dozens of questions which probed every detail of it. She was hugely enthusiastic and for a politician remarkably intellectually curious. She loved exploring ideas, Hayek, Freedman, the Bible, socialism, but managed at the same time to be intensely practical. She loved an argument; hated 'yes' men; expected her colleagues to work as hard as her; she read everything we sent her from the policy unit; she had a limited sense of humour, except when there was no one else around; had great respect for the ability of the average person to manage their own affairs; and also had a real Christian faith which ultimately was the basis of her public policies. She was also exceptionally kind to all who worked for her.
       </p>
       <p>
        She may not have had a great sense of humour but she certainly had a dry wit, as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard

        reminded us early on in her term. She declared to a

        conference her absolute pride that she was the first, the very first, British Prime Minister to be—there was a pause—'a research scientist', she said.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was one of those people who demonstrated that the individual can make a difference. In her case, not only did she change lives but also she changed a country and contributed to changing the world for the better.

          Baroness Thatcher
         </a>
         , I made a statement extending our condolences to her family and noting her contribution as leader of the United Kingdom—the first woman to do so. She was certainly a woman of conviction—not convictions that I share, but a woman of conviction. I was very pleased that former Prime Minister Howard accepted my invitation to represent the nation and the government at the ceremonial funeral that was held for Baroness Thatcher in London on 17 April.
