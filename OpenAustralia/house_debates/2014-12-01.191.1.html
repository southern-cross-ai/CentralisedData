       <p>
        On Saturday, 6 December, I will be attending a farewell function for Clinton and Trish Wardle, who will be moving on after a decade as ministry team leaders of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_Christ" rel="nofollow">
         Churches of Christ
        </a>
        Modbury. The Churches of Christ is located immediately adjacent to my electorate office and, as such, I have developed not only a close personal association with many of its members but also a personal friendship with Clinton and Trish. Indeed, from time to time, my office has used the church premises for community receptions and presentations, and I am grateful to have been able to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        As civic leaders and local residents I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank Clinton and Trish for their work in the local area over the last decade. I have no doubt that they have made a difference to the lives of many local people. I particularly acknowledge their welcoming and open door attitude to new arrivals in the area regardless of people's background, nationality, culture or religionâ€”often making available the church facilities to them for their own cultural use. Taking a leadership role in any community is never easy, and Clinton spoke about this in his sermon only a couple of week ago. I have no doubt that Clinton and Trish will be missed by the many friends they have made over the years in my local area and I wish them well as they settle into their new community.
