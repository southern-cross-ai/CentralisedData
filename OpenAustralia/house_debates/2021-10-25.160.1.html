        I rise today to celebrate the life of the little legend that is Richie Walsh, the most inspiring boy that I have ever met. My introduction to the Walsh family was in October last year, when I helped them seek permanent residency here in Australia, in my electorate of Bonner, so Richie could receive treatment for a rare form of cancer that he was battling. What started out as an initial request for support very quickly evolved into a special bond. Richie fought incredibly hard. He loved life and lived it to the fullestâ€”that I will never forget. A few weeks ago I attended a celebration of Richie's life, where all guests were asked to wear the colours of the rainbow in his memory. It was a beautiful ceremony where precious family moments and cherished memories were shared by those nearest and dearest to him.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, the Walsh family are truly remarkable. During this time their enormous heart for helping others hasn't diminished. Everywhere Richie went, he took his headphones and his iPad. He was famous for them. Even Richie's nurse said that she'd never seen him without them. With the Bonner community as well as many Australians across the country touched by Richie's story and legacy, the family asked that condolences for Richie be in the form of donations so that they could send iPads engraved with his name to every bed in the oncology ward at the

        . In just under one week, the Walsh family have smashed their fundraising target for the Queensland Children's Hospital, and 27 engraved iPads are now on their way to children on the oncology ward. But the family isn't stopping there. They are now fundraising to send another batch of iPads not only to the children's hospital here in Brisbane but also to every bed on the oncology ward at Perth Children's Hospital. They aren't limiting themselves to Australia, either. They are planning to send iPads to the children battling cancer in Richie's home town of Manchester in the

        , a beautiful full-circle act of generosity which will touch the lives of so many children and their families around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Walsh family are currently in the process of registering Little Legends for Richie as a charity to raise funds for children battling cancer and their families. They already have a dedicated team onboard to help with all the work and planning involved with registering this charity and making sure that it honours Richie's life. I will keep sharing Richie's legacy. He can always count on me to be in his corner. Rest easy, little legend.
