        I rise today to express my absolute frustration that the community of Denmark has not been able to access an additional postbox. This seems like a very simple issue; however, despite my lobbying for over two years and the lobbying of the shire for over five years, we have had no results. The problem is quite simple: Denmark, a beautiful regional community in

        , has a single postbox in the retail sector. Denmark has over 4,000 residents spread around the area and they need an additional postbox. Denmark has the highest median age of any community in

        and it needs a postbox which is easily accessed by its elderly residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        One such proposal is that a box could be located near the entrance to Amaroo Village. This is a village that has eight senior units and is already serviced by the postie five days a week.

        has refused the additional postbox on what now seems to be commerciality grounds. A commerciality test for essential services is inappropriate in the regions. The good people of Denmark should not be discriminated against because they live in a regional area, and the elderly residents of Denmark should be provided with greater access to essential services. Australia Post's commerciality test and the minister's unwillingness to seek reform are letting the people of Denmark down. The shire of Denmark has been requesting this box since 2007â€”over five years. It seems crazy that even an MP is unable to get an extra postbox for a community that has demonstrated an ongoing need.
