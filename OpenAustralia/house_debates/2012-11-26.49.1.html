        I rise to speak about the school presentation evenings in Townsville that come about at the end of every year. One of the joys of being a local member is to attend as many of the school presentation evenings and speech nights as you possibly can. It is a great way of showing support for your constituency. A lot of them were held in our last week of sittings here, but I was able to get to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_School" rel="nofollow">
         Cathedral School
        </a>
        last week and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's" rel="nofollow">
         St Patrick's
        </a>
        on the weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cathedral School's event was the junior school graduation and saw the grade 6 students get upâ€”from the orchestra, to the wind ensemble, to having the whole school on stage doing a song that I have no idea what it was about. They all had actions and dance moves far beyond my boarding school two-step, with the biting of the bottom lip. They were a joy to all of the parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, the school was able to get their whole presentation evening start on time at 6.30 and they were out of there by 8.30. It was a spectacularly run evening, although the school principal, Mr Ian Gamack, and the junior school principal, Mr Paul Taylor, both used the opportunity to drop a large load onto their local federal member. When Cathedral School was in Canberra I happened to get punted out of question time that day, and they used me as an example of what not to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, to all the schools in Townsville I had the opportunity to visit, I thank you so much.
