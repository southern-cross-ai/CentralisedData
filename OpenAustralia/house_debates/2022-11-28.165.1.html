        As we approach the end of the year and we start to take stock and acknowledge all that has happened and the tough times in our communities, I want to give a shout out to the people of Werriwa. The holiday period is one of joy and celebration, but it can also be an incredibly tough time for many families who are celebrating Christmas for the first time without a loved one, and that is never easy. If Christmas brings up emotions for you, please remember that there is help available from organisations like Lifeline,

        and many others. Please make sure you reach out if you need to.
       </p>
       <p>
        The past few years have been particularly difficult for Australia, and while this year may have been better for some, it's had its own unique and tough challenges. We're now entering the holiday period, and many will be going away for the first time in several years. It's a time when there will be more people on the road, so I encourage all in our community to be extra vigilant on the road and to stay safe. No matter where you're off to, or how late you may be, please take your time. Take care and remember: double demerit points will be enforced.

        It's a privilege to be elected as the representative of my community in this place. It has been wonderful to attend so many community events this year and to meet with constituents and community members. Thank you to everyone who has sent me an invitation and to all the volunteers for all the work you've done in the electorate this year. Werriwa is an incredibly diverse electorate and I thank all the multicultural groups for inviting me to celebrations, meeting with me to discuss their concerns and for their work in our community. Particularly during the worst of COVID, you were incredibly important in making sure that the updated information was provided in a form that could be understood by your community.
       </p>

        I'd also like to thank all the amazing volunteers at the Liverpool

        , Middleton Grange RFS and RFS control centre, along with the Liverpool, Campbelltown and Fairfield police commands for all their work in recent yearsâ€”especially during the flood events of the past few months. You've been keeping our community safe, and I appreciate it. The dedication you show is unwavering and amazing. All of your work and all the work of all volunteers doesn't go unnoticed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Please remember to drive carefully over the holiday break. Don't drive through floodwaters as you put yourselves and anybody who has to rescue you in danger. Keep abreast of all the warnings, and, most of all, thank you to everybody in Werriwa for trusting me to be your representative again. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. Please keep safe, and I look forward to working with you all next year.
