       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the bravery of the former Captain of the Valley Heights Rural Fire Brigade,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Price" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Price
        </a>
        , during the devastating
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        bushfires of 2013. Last Saturday, I had the privilege and was absolutely delighted to attend the station's annual general meeting, where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Price" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Price
        </a>
        was acknowledged and honoured for his bravery. Last month, Mr Price was awarded the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner's Certificate of Commendation for his outstanding actions and service.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 17 October 2013, a fire was reported at Linksview Road at Springwood. Within 30 minutes it had crossed Hawkesbury Road and was spreading rapidly. Mr Price took the brigade's personnel carrier to Singles Ridge Road at Winmalee to check on the safety of residents. On his arrival at the Rainbow Pre-school, where five adults and 13 children, aged two to five, were on the scene, with fire approaching,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Price" rel="nofollow">
         Captain Price
        </a>
        made the decision to evacuate everyone and drove them to Springwood Public School, to safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        He then returned to Singles Ridge Road to transport residents who were unable to leave under their own steam. The conditions were extreme. On the way back to safety, the vehicle sustained a damaged tyre. Captain Price changed the tyre of the fully loaded vehicle under severe ember attack before leaving the fire zone, returning all to safety. I congratulate him and acknowledge his bravery.
