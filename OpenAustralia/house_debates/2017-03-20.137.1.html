       <p>
        Earlier this month I was asked to launch a world record attempt right in the heart of my electorate. Before I get into that world record attempt, let me tell you a little bit about the organisation which is the current holder of the world record and which organised this second attempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The organisation is People Who Care. It is a community-based, not-for-profit organisation based near the border of my electorate in the suburb of Guildford, which my good friend the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Wyatt
        </a>
        looks after. It has been around since 1980 and relies on donations and funding to provide essential care services such as garden maintenance, transport and domestic services for those who need it throughout the Perth metropolitan area. As part of these services People Who Care is allowing more people to live independently and improve their quality of life through regular social contact and other services. Its services and programs are designed to assist people to remain in their homes and enjoy life whilst maintaining a connection to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now let me tell you about this world record attempt, which my wife Cheryle, my mother-in-law and I all took part in. People Who Care held a health expo at Sir James Mitchell Park in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         South Perth
        </a>
        , which is in my electorate. This expo had stalls and activities aimed at over-50s and was an opportunity for the community to come together. Part of this day was the outdoor fitness world record attempt, which aimed to have the most people aged over 55 taking part in a light exercise activity for 30 minutes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be interested to know that the world record was first held by the Kiwis, then it was held by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , and it is now held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year People Who Care had 148 people take part and currently hold the record. Unfortunately, even with me recruiting my wife and mother-in-law, we failed to beat that record this year. However—and I am sure I can speak for those who took part—the fun of exercising in a large group on the beautiful South Perth foreshore was worth it, and I thank People Who Care for organising the day and look forward to the next attempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I finish up I want to mention some of the outstanding work and contribution that this government is making in this sector in helping older people stay in their own homes longer. In Swan, approximately $300,000 has been made available for home support services through the Commonwealth Home Support Program growth funding round. This Commonwealth Home Support Program offers more choice and flexibility for older people. The program helps frail, older people who are in need of assistance to continue living independently at home and in their communities for longer. It helps these people avoid or delay having to move to a complex form of aged care. This is another example of the coalition government getting on with the job, by supporting people in their local communities.

         I thank the honourable member for that contribution, and I am sure the member for Hasluck would be honoured to know that you mentioned him in your speech.
