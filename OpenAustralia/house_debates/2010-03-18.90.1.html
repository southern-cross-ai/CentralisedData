        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That:
        <dl>
         <dt>
          (1)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          the House invite the Honourable Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, to attend and address the House on Friday, 26 March 2010, at a time to be fixed by the Speaker;
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (2)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          unless otherwise ordered, at the sitting of the House on Friday, 26 March 2010;
          <dl>
           <dt>
            (a)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            the proceedings shall be welcoming remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and an address by the President of the Republic of the United States of America, after which the sitting of the House automatically shall be adjourned; and
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (b)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            the provisions of standing order 257(c) shall apply to the area of Members’ seats as well as the galleries;
           </dd>
          </dl>
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (3)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          a message be sent to the Senate inviting Senators to attend the House as guests for the welcoming remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and address by the President of the United States of America; and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (4)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          any variation to this arrangement be made only by an action by the Speaker.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        In speaking to that motion briefly, members would be aware, as I think members of the general public are aware, that the arrangements regarding the visit by the President of the United States of America will be impacted on by events out of the control of this chamber but events occurring in another parliamentary chamber—that is, in the United States. We will make arrangements and let people know, for the benefit of members and senators and the general public, as soon as they are finalised. At this stage it is intended that the President of the United States of America will arrive in Canberra late on Thursday, 25 March 2010. On Friday, 26 March 2010, there will be meetings with the Governor-General, with the Prime Minister and with the Leader of the Opposition. There will be the address to the parliament and, if time permits, there will also be a luncheon. We will try to let members and senators know as soon as these details are finalised.
