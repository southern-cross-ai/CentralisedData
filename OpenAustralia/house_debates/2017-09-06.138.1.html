        I have been presented with a climate justice petition signed by nearly 800 residents from my electorate of Mayo. These signatures are among the more than 25,000 signatures collected in 90 electorates by a coalition of faith based organisations across Australia. Their names have become part of one of the largest ever multi-electorate petitions calling for stronger action on climate change and calling on this country to reduce its emissions, to transition to renewables and to support vulnerable communities during that transition. This coalition includes

       </p>
       <p>
        There is no denying that climate change is happening. The science is in.
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy vacuum created by the lack of action by this government and its predecessor is not only hurting the environment for future generations; it is eroding investor confidence and crippling businesses and everyday householders with ever-climbing energy bills. It is time for the Prime Minister to show true leadership on this issue. Despite the Finkel review being published in early June, we are yet to see any action on the clean energy target. We cannot wait for months to pass without any meaningful action. So this petition is a reminder to government that people of differing faiths can join together and work together to see better federal policies to protect our world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Climate change is the No. 1 issue that concerns the young people in my electorate of Mayo and, in particular, Young Mayo, my youth advisory committeeâ€”so much so that, during the July school holidays, we walked up to Mount Barker's summit and unfurled a banner calling for action on climate change. Young people wrote messages to the Minister for the Environment and Energy, because young people want our government and our community to do all it can to address climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later today, I will take great pleasure in presenting that banner to Minister Frydenberg. I would love to show you the banner itself, but, alas, props are not allowed in the chamber; however, some of the messages from young people include, '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        have the ability to breathe in the future?' And for future generations, 'Please do something'. The action and this petition demonstrate that climate change is a critical issue for the Australian community, irrespective of your faith or your age, or, indeed, your political allegiances. I will be referring this petition to the

          No, I'm not handing in the petition. The petition is going to the committee.
