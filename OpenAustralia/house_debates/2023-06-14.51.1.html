         YFS
        </a>
        is a unique, place-based organisation that provides a wide range of services and opportunities for people in the city of Logan and the surrounding areas. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outgoing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of YFS, Cath Bartolo. I know the member for Rankin, who is here in the chamber, would equally would join me in these remarks. Cath has announced that she'll be stepping down from her role as the CEO after 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cath Bartolo is a name well recognised in the community because she built YFS into a dynamic organisation which has achieved outcomes for so many people in our community. Cath has been a passionate advocate for the people of Logan. To use her own words, everybody needs a chance. I've always admired Cath's unwavering passion for her community. She has achieved an incredible amount over the past two decades, including her AM for significant service to youth, social welfare and the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cath will continue as CEO of YFS until the end of June and will work with the incoming CEO,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_John" rel="nofollow">
         Christopher John
        </a>
        , who brings with him enormous experience to his new role. I am confident that he will build on Cath's work, retaining the YFS values, and I wish both Cath and Christopher all the best as they embark on the next chapter of their professional lives. I'd like to thank Cath in particular for the enormous amount she has done for the community of Logan and surrounds over the years, and I wish her all the best for her future.
