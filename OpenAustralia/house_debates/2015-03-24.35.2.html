        Lee Kuan Yew did not just lead his country; he made his country. In the mid-1950s, when he first came to prominence in Singapore, his country was poor and friendless. Today, it is rich and well connected. It is one of the great success stories of the modern world, thanks to the ideas, the drive and the judgement of Lee Kuan Yew and thanks to the talents of the Singaporean people which he unleashed. It is a remarkable economic success story. It is one of the most remarkable economic success stories in history. Within a generation, Singapore has moved from the

         Third World
        </a>
        to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" rel="nofollow">
         First World
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew blazed a trail that has been followed by other countries in our region—by Taiwan and by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        —and most recently it has been followed by China itself. He was once asked which of his decisions had made the biggest contribution to Singapore's success. 'Making English the common language' was his response. This not only defused ethnic tensions inside Singapore but also gave Singapore easy entry into the global economy. He also maintained Singapore's British based common-law legal system and ran an utterly clean and corruption-free administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        One statistic tells the story of modern Singapore. In 1965, Singapore's gross domestic product per head was about one-third that of Australia. Today, Singapore's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        per head is almost double that of Australia. In the 1980s, when Singapore was surging ahead and Australia risked stagnating, he said that we risked ending up as—to use that phrase—'the poor white trash of Asia'. That phrase stung because we feared that it might be true. I have to say that a quarter century of reform under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Keating
        </a>
        and then under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Costello
        </a>
        restored our position, but, if we are to avoid his prophecy, the challenge for this generation is to ensure that the age of reform in this country has been merely interrupted, not ended.
       </p>
       <p>
        The relationship between Singapore and Australia is strong and growing stronger all the time, thanks to Lee Kuan Yew and his successors, especially his son, the current Prime Minister—and friend of Australia—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong" rel="nofollow">
         Lee Hsien Loong
        </a>
        , who should receive our deepest condolences today. Today, two-way trade between Singapore and Australia is some $30 billion a year. Singapore is our fourth largest source of inwards investment. Every year, some 300,000 Australians travel to Singapore, and every year about the same number of Singaporeans travel to Australia. Some 100,000 Singaporean citizens are alumni of Australian universities, and Singapore is a military ally of Australia. Under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Power_Defence_Arrangement" rel="nofollow">
         Five Power Defence Arrangement
        </a>
        , Singaporean forces regularly exercise and train here in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        We share a language and much institutional architecture with Singapore. Singapore and Australia are natural partners, and I hope that over time our relationship with Singapore will be as easy, as close and as familial as it has long been with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . And, if so, that too will be part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy. He did not just build Australia but spurred this country at a critical time in our history to be better than we might have been.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we mourn Lee Kuan Yew's passing, but forever we will celebrate the life of this great nation builder and leader for our time. I acknowledge the presence today of the Singaporean High Commissioner, and I hope that he will pass on to his government and his country the condolences of the people and the parliament of Australia.

         Labor pays tribute to the father of modern Singapore and a principal architect of harmony and prosperity in our region.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" rel="nofollow">
          Lee Kuan Yew
         </a>
         owns a giant legacy of many dimensions, and today we recognise, briefly, what he accomplished. Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore was born in turbulent times at home and in the region. Nations across Asia felt the ragged edge of the British withdrawal and decolonisation. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_Emergency" rel="nofollow">
          Malayan Emergency
         </a>
         , Konfrontasi and the Sukarno split threatened peace and stability, and there were internal as well as external perils.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Prime Minister
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Hawke
         </a>
         —Lee Kuan Yew's great friend on the world stage and friendly rival on the golf course—recalled,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lee" rel="nofollow">
          Harry Lee
         </a>
         faced profound challenges at home. To quote Bob Hawke:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         He found himself leading a country deeply divided on religious and ethnic lines, surrounded by powerful potential enemies, with a weak economy and no natural resources at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         From that uncertain platform he built a modern, prosperous nation—a leader in the region, especially through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         —and a trading powerhouse in the world. But his ambitions for his people and his country reached higher than this. In 1997, at a celebration of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
          Chinese New Year
         </a>
         , Lee Kuan Yew reflected on how far his nation had come and the measure of true success. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We cannot measure our happiness just by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         growth. It is how our families and friends care for each other, how we look after our old and nurture our young. They are what make for a closely knit society, one we can be proud to belong to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australians, in fact, owe a debt to Lee Kuan Yew. He built modern Singapore. Modern Singapore and modern Singaporeans are a dynamic people, amongst the first rank of Australia's friends and allies. Lee Kuan Yew, the proud father and tireless servant of the nation he brought forth, is now at rest. Our condolences to his family, his friends and all the people of Singapore who share grief at his passing.
