        As we go around our electorates we see a great many community groups that do tremendous work. Over the break I had the opportunity to catch up with a number of those great community groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, one of those groups that has done so much good work over the last 10 or so decided to close their doors as of 30 June. The group I am talking about is the Logan House Fire Support Network, led by the charity's founder, Louie Naumovski. They have said that their announcement to close has been forced by escalating difficulties in dealing with the Queensland state Labor government and also the policies within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Fire" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Fire
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Services
        </a>
        . One of their greatest achievements was when Logan House Fire Support Network lobbied the Queensland government to mandate photoelectric smoke alarms, successfully doing so in 2016. I believe that we are a safer community as a result of this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Logan House Fire Support Network also created the Woodridge Santa Run, which is on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Day
        </a>
        every year. Fire, police, ambulance and emergency vehicles would drive through the streets of Logan handing out lollies, toys and presents to those who could not afford them. I hope that somebody else takes up this mantle. Our local community is richer, more knowledgeable and safer for having Logan House Fire Support Network as part of our local community. I would like to thank Louie and Christine for their efforts since the charity started back in 2014. I will also add that, in addition to the tremendous work they've done in this space, they have also done an enormous amount of work in the community in helping out in flood recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great community institution in the electorate of Forde and the city of Logan is Joncia Gardens, which is a terrific and breathtaking garden wedding venue. But the sad news is that the Queensland state government has advised John and Marcia Rivett that they are going to resume their land to build a new high school. This is despite the state government having land down the road on Park Ridge Road that could be used for exactly the same thing. When I visited John and Marcia, John admitted that rebuilding the gardens and the venue would be impossible. So, sadly they have accepted their fate with heavy hearts. I believe the resumption process is now underway and both John and Marcia have been able to find a new home, but it will not be the same and our community will be the poorer for the loss of Joncia Gardens.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a positive note, Coles Loganholme have done a tremendous job in raising money this year for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Freeze" rel="nofollow">
         Big Freeze
        </a>
        , raising a total of $9,308 for motor neurone disease. Due to the generosity of their staff and their customers, they were able to raise these funds and support the wonderful research to fight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MND" rel="nofollow">
         MND
        </a>
        , which we know is a disease that has no treatment.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Freeze" rel="nofollow">
         The Big Freeze
        </a>
        involves sitting in an ice bath or holding an ice bucket for the challenge to raise awareness, and I know that has an enormous amount of community support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to thank the team at Red Cross Beenleigh. I had the opportunity to catch up with them again last week and spend some time with Barbara and her team to look at the valuable services they provide right across our community of Beenleigh and also across the Forde community and into other parts of the city of Logan and even down into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_Rim" rel="nofollow">
         Scenic Rim
        </a>
        and into the Northern Gold Coast. Red Cross offers affordable and reliable mobility aids and equipment for short-term hire at very reasonable prices. This includes commode chairs, bed tables, mobile showers, over-toilet frames, shower chairs, walkers, walking sticks and wheelchairs. The Beenleigh branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        are also in need of more volunteers, so if people could spend some time to come down and help Barbara and her team, they are located in the Beenleigh Showgrounds at gate 3 and they can be contacted directly on 38074085. All of these community organisation groups have made a tremendous contribution to our community. I wish the continuing ones every success, and to those who have finished: thank you for your service.
