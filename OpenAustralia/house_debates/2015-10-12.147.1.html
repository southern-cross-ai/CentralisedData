        Last Wednesday was another great day for Geelong, and a great day for Corangamite: the opening of the Carbon Revolution factory in

         Waurn Ponds
        </a>
        on the site of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Deakin University
        </a>
        —a great university for our region and for our nation. Carbon Revolution has become one of our regions' great success stories: a powerhouse of jobs growth, opportunity and innovation—an advanced manufacturer at the cutting-edge of innovation in the global automotive and aerospace market, exporting its carbon fibre wheels to the world. You can see that I stand here with great pride talking about the wonderful jobs growth, innovation and advanced manufacturing happening in my electorate of Corangamite.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July this year, Carbon Revolution became the first company in the world to supply mass-produced carbon fibre wheels on standard equipment for Ford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        . It is an extraordinary deal. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Mustang" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is now proudly being powered by Australian innovators underpinned by the wonderful research work into carbon fibre which began at Deakin university. It is an extraordinary story; it started with students competing to make a small car with light wheels. They experimented with carbon fibre, and look what this has become. Carbon Revolution has just signed an agreement with a

        aircraft landing gear manufacturer, there is an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO" rel="nofollow">
         IPO
        </a>
        in the wings to tap into the $40 billion global wheels market and we expect many more deals to come. It is with great pride that this factory has been funded in part by a $5 million grant from the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund—a fund to which our government has contributed $15 million. While the fund was announced by the previous Labor government, not one dollar was actually spent by Labor; all of that $15 million has been spent and delivered by our government, with great pride. There will be another funding round announced very shortly and more jobs to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        The GRIIF is just one of the ways in which the Turnbull government is driving jobs growth across the region. There is the $14 million national Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre to drive innovation and smart jobs in the advanced manufacturing sector and $2.6 million for the Geelong region job connections program, which is funding local employment programs and great initiatives like the Geelong jobs fair as well as a local employment facilitator. So, on the ground, there is some great grassroots action. There is the $155 million Growth Fund, which includes $60 million for the Next Generation Manufacturing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund" rel="nofollow">
         Investment fund
        </a>
        , and the establishment of an Australian Bureau of Statistics Centre of Excellence to be opened earlier next year. So we are a powerhouse of jobs growth. We are working very hard, as there are some challenges, to transition our region from traditional manufacturing. Carbon Revolution is a great story about the future and about jobs growth in Corangamite.
