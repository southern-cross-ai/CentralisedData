        My question is for the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister outline to the House why a strong, stable and transparent policy approach is important to ensure that we defeat our enemies abroad, so that we can be safe at home? How could alternative approaches jeopardise our national security?

          As one of my colleagues called out: it's a good question. It is a good question, because it's very important to be consistent in your approach to national security issues. On this side of the House we've always sought to do so. On many occasions the Labor Party has sought to mirror that consistent approach. So it surprised many across the political landscape when the Leader of the Opposition rehabilitated Senator Dastyari so quickly after he resigned for the first time over the issues to do with national security. I call him Senator Dastyari; some have been rude enough to call him 'Szechuan Sam', which I think is very wrong.

                Senator Dastyari not only contradicted government policy and Labor Party policy at that time; he also, incredibly, asked the Chinese donor who is at the centre of current controversies to pay for his personal debts. This seems to have been lost on many in the Labor Party. There is a difference between political donations and the payment of personal debts.

                It is the difference between sweet and sour. It's a very significant difference. And then more recently, of course, we found out that Senator Dastyari—oh, they're bringing out the big guns again!

The point about the lapses of Senator Dastyari's approach to these matters and the most recent revelations concerning his discussions with Mr Huang about his communications is that the jury is well and truly in on Senator Dastyari. What we now need to go to is the Leader of the Opposition's judgement. This goes to the Leader of the Opposition's judgement. Not only did he rehabilitate him; he's now been required to sack him again. Many people have asked why. Why would the Leader of the Opposition be so connected to Senator Dastyari? I think the answer is much more obvious than we know. In

                       My question is to the Prime Minister. On Wednesday and Thursday last week, Fairfax reported two stories containing national security information. The Attorney-General even confirmed national security information should never find its way into the hands of the media, but it has. Has the government ordered any investigation into what the Attorney-General has admitted is a leak of national security information, and who had possession of that information among ministers and their staff?

                        The honourable member omitted one important fact, which was the information that he is describing as having been referred to in the Fairfax press. Apparently it was something on Wednesday and Thursday. Were you talking about Senator Dastyari? Is that right?

                        No, very good. He's referred to Senator Dastyari, and my response is very simply this: that leaks of national security information should never occur, full stop. If the honourable member is alleging that a security agency was responsible for putting information into the press then he should make that allegation plainly.

                          Yes, on direct relevance. The Prime Minister is now referring to an aspect of the question that was not stated and therefore cannot be relevant. The question quite specifically referred to ministers or their staff being responsible for the leak of information and asked whether the Prime Minister has conducted an investigation. It at no point questioned the agencies themselves.

                           To the Manager of Opposition Business I've been very generous in the point of order, allowing him to make his point, but his first point, about the Prime Minister's answer not being relevant, isn't correct. The Prime Minister needs to be relevant to the question, which he is on the policy matter that's there. If the Manager of Opposition Business is worried that the Prime Minister is answering a question in a different way or answering a question in a way not to his satisfaction, it's certainly not the first time.

                            If the honourable member wants to ask me a question about information published in the Fairfax press or anywhere else, then he should spell out what the information is, because he has, in some rather coy way, failed to actually describe it, which makes me think it might have something to do with a certain senator—the senator whose name apparently cannot be mentioned by the Labor Party. Well, let me say this to the honourable member: if you're not prepared to name him, you shouldn't be prepared to keep him in the Senate.

                              I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the strongest achievements of this government has been to stop the boats, and to stop drownings at sea and to get kids out of detention. We have closed 17 detention centres and we have not had a successful people-smuggling venture now for 1,226 days. We know: if we want to undo that success, we change the policies—because that's what

                              had successfully stopped the boats. The Labor Party then changed the policy settings that saw 50,000 people come on 800 boats and, tragically, 1,200 people drown at sea.

                              We've seen a lot of banter from the left of the Labor Party. Many members opposite that I'm looking at at the moment are in favour, once again, of undoing those policy settings. This government is not going to fall for that trick. I'm afraid to say that it is clear now that the Labor Party is slowly dismantling the policy that they took to the last election, which, at the time, they claimed replicated our policy in stopping the boats. There are many, many members opposite who would see people come from the regional processing centres to Australia tomorrow, which would result in a recommencement of the boats, because the people-smugglers would be up there saying, 'You can go to

There are 65 million people in the world who are displaced who want to come here; not all of them can fit in Bennelong.
