       <p>
        Last Saturday my wife, Bernadette, and I had the pleasure of attending the annual Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation Ball. It was not the first time that I have attended this particular ball. As a matter of fact, Bernadette reliably tells me that I have been five times—with her, of course! This night, like the others, was an enormous success; on this particular night they raised $175,000 for that charity. This event, however, is only one of the activities of the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation. This organisation, which was started in 2000 and which comprises many of our leading local businesspeople such as our paediatricians and our local health providers, very much runs with a businesslike approach to raising funds for the charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The charity seeks, as the name implies, to develop all the necessary medical and technical support to assist the paediatric treatment of kids in Macarthur. Astonishingly, since 2004 the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation has bought over $1 million worth of medical equipment to enhance the level of health care offered to local children being treated in Campbelltown and Camden hospitals. In addition, it continues to support numerous other children’s community health programs and to conduct research and establish preventative programs for children’s health issues, specifically in Macarthur. As a result of the outstanding work of the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, quite frankly the need for local parents to transport sick kids for medical treatment anywhere outside our region has been significantly lessened. This has been the fantastic contribution that this particular charity has made to the welfare of the children of the Macarthur region.

         The Kids
        </a>
        of Macarthur Health Foundation is creating opportunities to enhance the quality of life of children in Macarthur, and I believe it is building a better future for everyone. This is the premier charity within our region. Like all other charities, it is supported by amazing people, and without those people it would not be anywhere near as successful. I mention Paul Sinclair, who has been a local pharmacist for the last 21 years. He is chair of the board of Kids of Macarthur and he is also chair of Myrtle Cottage, which provides care for the frail and aged, as well as providing respite care for families with dementia sufferers.
