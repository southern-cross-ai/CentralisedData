All interjections are disorderly, but, when I have made it clear to the House that I am seeking to hear the question again because I have been prevented due to interjections, anyone who interjects is in very grave danger.

              Having had the opportunity to now listen to the question, I say to the member for Isaacs that a large part of that question relates to a time prior to the Prime Minister assuming office and, indeed, prior to him becoming a member of parliament.

The members who have been warned will now leave under 94(a), and they include the member for Lindsay. If there are any others, you are lucky. But, at the rate you are behaving, I will get you soon.

                 Trade unions claim to be representing their workers. They are fiduciaries; they are in a positon of trust. We say, and the law will say, that they cannot take payments from the people with whom they are negotiating on behalf of their members. And that is the point. It is about accountability; it is about honesty; it is about integrity. The fact that the member for Isaacs stoops so low shows what a raw nerve we have hit. The one thing the Leader of the Opposition will not do is say what the half-a-million dollars was really for—what the $300,000 was really for or what the $32,000 was really for. He can set everybody's mind at rest: if he is so proud of this record let him tell the truth.
