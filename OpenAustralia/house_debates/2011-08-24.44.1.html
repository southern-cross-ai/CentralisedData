       <p>
        On indulgence, I wish to make a short statement about the house fire in Kingston. A well-known Tongan-Samoan family has suffered a great loss in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City
        </a>
        this morning where, it is believed, 11 members of their immediate and extended family passed away in a fire. The family has been in Australia for more than 25 years and have been Logan stalwarts for the past 15 years. The family are respected by the Tongan, Samoan and wider communities in Logan for their commitment to making Logan a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        One survivor is in Logan Hospital with severe burns. He is well known for assisting local families with migration matters and has had some pretty good success. His wife was a devoted wife and mother, a person who cared deeply for her family, her church and her community. She will be missed and mourned greatly by the Logan community. Although I cannot confirm the other members who perished in this horrific fire I can confirm that students of Mabel Park State High School and Mabel Park Primary School are today mourning the loss of this family. Flags are flying at half mast.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to thank emergency services, all the other support services and the local community for rallying around the family at this terrible time. I thank members from other areas for the concerns that have been expressed and I will pass on their condolences to the family.

         I am sure that members would want me to associate the House with the remarks by the Minister for Trade who is also, more importantly, the member for Rankin. We pass on our condolences to the family and friends and, importantly, to the Rankin community.

         <p>
          As the shadow parliamentary secretary for immigration and citizenship, I also wish to add my respect and my wholehearted sympathy for the sad loss of 11 family members. I spoke just a few moments ago about that tragic loss. I think the House would share in expressing our heartfelt sympathies for the members of the Tongan and Samoan communities. I understand the MultiLink Community Services organisation called a meeting today. I want to acknowledge the great work that Helen Coyne and her team are doing to help the family and the community and the neighbours of this tragic loss.
