        I rise to pay tribute to long-time
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        volunteer Marie Adams, who devoted her life to charitable causes. Marie, who was 81 years of age, died very recently. She gave most of her spare time to charitable work. She was always in my office talking to me about the Red Cross. She was totally dedicated and one of the longstanding members of Belmont Red Cross. She began volunteering there in 1983.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marie held many executive positions over 30 years worth of service, including presidency seven times, secretary six times and treasurer five times. She was also involved in scouting. Within the Red Cross she was involved with Telecross and the blood bank. In 2013 she was recommended by her fellow members of Belmont Red Cross for the Red Cross distinguished service award for her decades of dedication to the Red Cross. She was announced winner of the award, which was presented by

        Marie was a role model for everyone in our community. I thank her and her family for allowing her to devote so much time to the Red Cross and to her community.
