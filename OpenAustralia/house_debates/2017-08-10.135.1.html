        Three very deserving residents in the Calare electorate have been named in the 2017 Queen's birthday honours list. I would like to take the opportunity to recognise each of them today. Firstly, Peter Veenstra of Clifton Grove in Orange has received a medal of the Order of Australia. Peter moved to Orange in 1984 when a friend informed him about a position at

        </a>
        . He phoned about the position from a phone box in the small town of Banana. He then went to teach at Kinross Wolaroi for 15 years whilst also taking on the role of student welfare coordinator. He was also a sports administrator and believes one of his greatest achievement was getting the

        in Orange in 1992, following the end of apartheid. He has become an integral part of our community through his involvement in various organisations, including the Lyndon community drug and alcohol service, Royal Far West, the Australian National Field Days, Orange Police Citizens Youth Club, the Orange sports council advisory committee and Cabonne council. He has also served as chief executive officer of Central West Rugby Union since 1987, marking 31 years. He has just retired from that position. I can attest to his effectiveness in that role as he often drafted me in to sit on the Central West Rugby Union judiciary. He often used to entice members to sit on that panel through the cooking of his wife, Lida! I know Lida would be very proud of the award that Peter has just received. I congratulate Peter and also Lida.
