        It's 1,165 daysâ€”that is how long this government has known there has been a problem with the loan sharks in the out-of-control payday loans industry in this country. In that time, the number of homes forced to turn to payday loans has jumped to 800,000. Yet, despite promise after promise by minister after minister we are no closer to clamping down on the loan sharks who continue to rip off consumers.

        , I call on this minister to start focusing and bring forward the full and proper legislation to stop the loan sharks and end the payday loan rip-off in Australia.
