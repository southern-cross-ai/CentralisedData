        I rise to honour the life and work of Greek-Australian journalist Kostas Nikolopoulos, who sadly passed away in January leaving behind him an extraordinary body of work in political and Hellenic journalism and a family and community deep in mourning. There are few people in the Victorian Hellenic community who would not know of Kostas's name or his extensive work. Over a career spanning more than three decades, Kostas worked as a producer and presenter of Greek language radio news on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        and served on the board of
        <i>
         The Greek Herald
        </i>
        and as deputy editor of
        <i>
         Neos
        </i>
        <i>
         K
        </i>
        <i>
         osmos
        </i>
        . Kostas was a trusted voice dedicated to bringing the news to the community in both English and Greek. He interviewed countless public figures including premiers and prime ministers, and was absolutely committed to not only writing for the Australian Hellenic community but also promoting the significant contributions the Greek community makes to Australian life.

        Kostas was more than a dedicated professional—he was a devoted member of a range of Greek organisations and also gave his time to teach the Greek language and culture. Kostas received a variety of awards from various levels of government recognising his pursuit of justice, contributions to multiculturalism and support of those in need. Sadly, he was never awarded an Australian honour, despite repeated attempts by me and others. Kostas was a wonderful man whose enormous contribution to our community endured far beyond the limits of his own life. He was an exemplary man, a true gentleman and a and friend to the entire community. I will miss seeing Kostas at one of the many Greek community functions or just bumping into him at a cafe in Oakleigh. I offer my sincere condolences to his wife Effie and son Niko. Rest in peace, Kostas—and be assured I will continue to see if you can be recognised with an Australia honour.
