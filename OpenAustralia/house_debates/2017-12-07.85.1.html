       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. This year the Prime Minister has lost three ministers, lost multiple votes in parliament, cancelled parliament, announced a tax hike for seven million Australians, cut penalty rates for 700,000 workers, ruled out a banking commission and then announced it, and made two million premises wait longer for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . Given the Prime Minister has spent 2017 hostage to his backbench and to events, why should Australians believe 2018 will be any better?

         Turning to 2018, Australians are hoping that they will not have to wait to 2018 for the Leader of the Opposition to acknowledge that Senator Dastyari has no place in this parliament. We've been having a debate about citizenship and allegiance. We have a senator in our parliament who has been asking questions, on order, for a foreign government.

           Almost everything is relevant to this particular question. The Prime Minister has gone to possibly the only issue that is not relevant to this question, and I ask that you draw him back to it.

            I almost agree with the Manager of Opposition Business! But I do need to say that the question was cast very wide, and perhaps if it didn't have the bit about looking forward to 2018 he'd have a better chance. The Prime Minister's completely in order.

             It says a lot about the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues that they think that Senator Dastyari's position is humorous. We have a Labor senator who has been working on behalf of a foreign government, who has been reading talking points about important matters of national security on behalf of a foreign government, who has been taking money from foreign nationals closely linked to that foreign government, and what did he get? Oh, sort of a rap over the knuckle with a wet lettuce. Now we find him in a position where he is giving countersurveillance advice to a Chinese national, Mr Huang, who he believes may be under surveillance by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
              ASIO
             </a>
             . Of course, the matters relating to Mr Huang are obviously matters that the Leader of the Opposition is familiar with. It is said Senator Dastyari was advised through a back channel by the Leader of the Opposition. It would be good to hear Senator Dastyari and the Leader of the Opposition tell us some more about that. Senator Dastyari went to the premises, the home, of Mr Huang, and he told him that he may be under surveillance by ASIO and how to avoid that surveillance. In other words, he was actively working against our Security Intelligence Organisation, whose job it is to keep us safe, and Labor thinks that's all a bit of a joke. Well, Australians believe national security is the primary obligation not just of the government but of every member of this House and our Senate. Senator Dastyari failed. He failed the loyalty test. He failed the allegiance test because he did not put Australia's interests first. Senator Dastyari should go, and every day he stays there is an indictment on the character of the Leader of the Opposition.
