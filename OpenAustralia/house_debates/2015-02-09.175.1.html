        Last Wednesday night I attended the Swansea Lions Club Youth of the Year event. It was an absolutely fantastic experience listening to the four young people make their final speeches. There was Jayde Robertson from Swansea High School, who has been a previous winner of my

        citizenship award. There was Chloe Harvey from

         Belmont High School
        </a>
        , who made a fantastic presentation, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
         Thomas Johnson
        </a>
        from Belmont High School, who is a young man who has been involved in practically everything in the community and has had to fight adversity and illness to achieve what he has achieved. Then there was the winner—Amber Lawrence. She comes from Warners Bay High School. She is a year 12 student. She was a member of the student executive last year and has been a peer support leader. She is an outstanding young woman. She made fantastic speeches on the night—both her impromptu speech and prepared speech—as did all the others.

        Thomas Johnson received the award for the best speeches but Amber, as I mentioned, was the successful winner on the night. There is not a thing that Amber is not involved in. Listening to these people was inspirational. I must say, I learnt from each and every one of their speeches.
