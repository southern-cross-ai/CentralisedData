       <p>
        I come to the chamber today to participate in this parliament's tribute to the Australian veterans who served in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Command" rel="nofollow">
         Bomber Command
        </a>
        in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . As has already been well testified, Bomber Command was a multinational allied force that some 10,000 Australians served in during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        . Over 4,000 of our fellow countrymen never came home. No branch of the Allied campaign in World War II suffered a greater casualty rate: 55,573 from all nations gave their lives, and that is almost half the number of men employed in the total effort. They were tasked with crippling the Nazis, using the controversial and deadly tactic of carpet bombing, with the aim of disabling critical infrastructure like railways and oil supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we know, a group of Australian veterans were in London in late June of this year for events to mark the operation's 70th anniversary. I am pleased to say that among them was 91-year-old Edgar Pickles from the town of Barham, in the southern part of my electorate of Farrer. Edgar's attendance was not just a celebrated occasion back home in Barham—he was reported upon by the
        <i>
         Times
        </i>
        of London no less. As that newspaper noted, the odds against survival were huge:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After 15 bombing raids over Germany in 1943, Edgar and his crew were the most experienced left in their squadron.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that year, at the height of the conflict, it was estimated that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAF
        </a>
        bomber crews had just a 16 per cent chance of surviving each sortie, with each expected to undertake 30 such missions. To say each flight could have been their last was not an understatement—it was more a probable outcome. In Edgar Pickles' time just two crews actually completed this 30-mission milestone before they were despatched for slightly less dangerous duties.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the veterans who attended—and those who could not—the commemoration in June was belated acknowledgment of their efforts. Many felt their role in that conflict had been written out of history. In fact, it was a divisive tactic. As an often quoted example, the raid on Dresden in early 1945 saw an estimated 25,000 human beings wiped from the planet, branded by some as a war crime. As Edgar also notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dresden was a very sad business. We didn't know it at the time—I guess ignorance was bliss.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say the $11 million memorial also has the blessing of the German people and equally commemorates all those killed during the bombings between 1939 and 1945. I am also delighted to report Edgar was one of the Diggers afforded the opportunity to be thanked personally by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         Her Majesty
        </a>
        Queen Elizabeth during the memorial service. I believe he was also particularly moved after being feted and welcomed by a town in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lincolnshire" rel="nofollow">
         North Lincolnshire
        </a>
        , which was the home of 550 Squadron in 1943.

        Squadron Leader Edgar Pickles
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFC" rel="nofollow">
         DFC
        </a>
        was not the only representative from Farrer to be at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Green Park
        </a>
        in London for the 70th anniversary. I know of a fellow 91-year-old—Gordon Pyle from Finley—who also had the opportunity to attend, along with his daughter. There will no doubt be others from my region who served with Bomber Command during that dark time in our history. Today I thank and honour them, those still with us and those who are not.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also acknowledge and thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Snowdon" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Snowdon
        </a>
        . As many might be aware, there was initially a very limited number of ex-servicemen from Australia set to attend the British service. That restriction was eventually lifted, allowing Edgar and Gordon and 105 other so-called 'roguish gentleman'—as the minister perceptively observed—the chance of a lifetime to be remembered. For many of them it may be their final chance.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding, I want to echo the comments of the opposition leader in this House on the occasion of Bomber Command's 70th anniversary. While it was a difficult campaign, both morally and militarily difficult, we must never forget that those who served were serving us, under our flag, serving our country and serving our cause, and we should continue to honour them for that effort. I also honour and salute the service and sacrifice of all who served in Bomber Command in defence of our nation's interests.

         As a former defence minister, the opportunity to speak to this motion certainly caught my eye and I have seized the opportunity. Having said that, I would not claim to be an expert on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Command" rel="nofollow">
          Bomber Command
         </a>
         , but I think that every Australian who grew up watching World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         movies in particular would have a full and proper understanding of the role the command played during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . Some 125,000 people participated in Bomber Command over the period of its existence, including 10,000 Australians. More than one in three would never come home: 3,486 Australians were lost in action and another 650 died in training accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
         This morning we paid tribute to another fallen soldier, one who tragically gave his life in Afghanistan. Right across the globe many Australians gave their lives in the name of defending Australia and our interests, and certainly those in Bomber Command were very much a part of that. We know now that Bomber Command yielded 19
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Cross
         </a>
         winners, and the Queen recently unveiled a new Bomber Command memorial amid the beautiful lawns and trees of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Green Park
         </a>
         , London. This recognition of the courage and dedication of the men who fought a relentless 2,000-day campaign is long overdue.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have very fond memories of travelling to Norway in 2005 or 2006 as part of a parliamentary delegation to European institutions,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" rel="nofollow">
          The Hague
         </a>
         and then to Norway. While in Norway we travelled west to a beautiful town called Bergen. Anyone who knows the area will agree it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. We were very touched to find some local men there who had maintained a small memorial to a number of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         personnel who had given their lives on a raid on a German submarine base in Bergen, the Germans having taken over Norway during the war. These local men had maintained this memorial for all of this time, and it was a memorial to a couple of Australians who were in that raid on that occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
         We were very pleased to come back to Australia and make a recommendation to the government that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth War Graves Commission
         </a>
         take authority and control over that memorial which had been built by the locals, because the locals were not going to be around for ever and we were very keen to ensure that tribute to those Australians, and those they flew with, meant they were properly remembered in Bergen. That is my personal association with that period of time and those raids, those things given by so many during that very concerning period for all of those participating in the Allied forces. It is my very great pleasure with others in this place, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to pay tribute to those who gave so much and did so much as a part of Bomber Command, and to acknowledge their contribution on this the 70th anniversary of the operations of that command.

          I rise to speak on the commemoration for the 70th anniversary of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Command" rel="nofollow">
           Bomber Command
          </a>
          and to honour all those British, Australian and Allied servicemen and women who sacrificed their lives in what was one of the most perilous times that the free world has ever faced. On 28 June 2012, her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
           II
          </a>
          officially dedicated the memorial in London to Bomber Command for the 70th anniversary, to recognise the remarkable service of airmen and women during
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
           World War II
          </a>
          . Approximately 125,000 British, Australian and Allied airmen served in Bomber Command, 55,573 of whom died and a further 9,838 were taken as prisoners of war. Of these, there were approximately 10,000 Australians in the Royal
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Air Force
          </a>
          or
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Air Force
          </a>
          squadrons attached to Bomber Command, with 3,848 casualties.
         </p>
         <p>
          The resilience of these men was amazing and was exemplified by Mr Robert Chester-Master
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
           OAM
          </a>
          . On a trip on one of the Lancaster bombers as a tail gunner, the perspex glass at the tail of the ship shattered and Mr Chester-Master suddenly found himself stranded in a Belgian field. To his great fortune, his life was saved by a Resistance fighter who was able to hide him until the end of the war. As he parachuted to safety, he became—like my father—a member of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_Club" rel="nofollow">
           Caterpillar Club
          </a>
          , a group for people who have successfully parachuted out of a disabled aircraft. The real story for the servicemen of Bomber Command was that they were willing to risk their lives every day in very dangerous and risky circumstances. For his service, Robert received and thoroughly deserved the Cross of Bravery and Fidelity from Belgium and was invited to unveil a plaque in honour of the 60th anniversary of his crash in the Belgian village.
         </p>
         <p>
          Their willingness to risk their lives in the defence of the liberty of their nation demonstrates the underlying selflessness of a member of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Force
          </a>
          . This attitude led Mr Chester-Master to enlist in Brisbane in 1942, as an 18-year-old. Upon his return to Australia, this selflessness led him to dedicate his life to the community. I had the great pleasure to work with Robert over many years during our involvement with Brisbane Tourism. To this day Robert is still giving back to the community through his involvement in the Air Crew Association and many other organisations, as well as in his dedication to recording the stories of 31
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
           RAAF
          </a>
          members who were able to escape in Belgium during World War II in his book
          <i>
           Against the Odds
          </i>
          . It is wonderful that Mr Chester-Master is still alive today and was able to attend the commemoration in London in June. On that day, Robert was the only ex-personnel of Bomber Command who was able to fit into his Bomber Command uniform—and I have been told that this was much to both the jealousy and the delight of the more than 100 Australians who were able to attend.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to acknowledge the very important contribution of a constituent in Ryan, Mr Vic Henderson, who served in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF" rel="nofollow">
           RAF
          </a>
          Squadron 150 in Bomber Command. Mr Henderson expressed his appreciation that he was able to attend the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial, and in particular the unveiling of the beautiful bronze statue which depicts a crew coming back from an operation. Quite poignantly, Mr Henderson met up with a man with whom he had served in Bomber Command, a man he had not seen or spoken to since that time.
         </p>
         <p>
          For Mr Henderson the week brought back many memories, and he thoroughly enjoyed the gleam in the soldiers' eyes and the smiles on their faces as they finally achieved official recognition and an official memorial to their service after waiting 67 years for it to occur. During the week they were shown and were able to sit in what was one of the most common aeroplanes, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_Bomber" rel="nofollow">
           Lancaster Bomber
          </a>
          , which certainly brought back strong emotions and memories. During the ceremony the Lancaster Bomber dropped one poppy petal for each of the 55,573 men who never came home, a very dignified recognition of those who lost their lives in the war effort.
         </p>
         <p>
          I pay my respects to those who died and I thank all those involved who contributed to the official memorial and commemoration in London. We acknowledge and commemorate the roles of all former and current servicemen and women who have defended our great nation, and I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their statements.

History's pages now proudly record the victory that transpired but, as we know, it was a struggle all the way. The forces of darkness were skilful and numerous, willing to stop at nothing in pursuit of their goals. It was only through the bravery and the fortitude of those who fought on the side of freedom that we are here to enjoy this day.

           No band of brothers was more important to victory or gave more of themselves than the airmen of Bomber Command. Of the 125,000 British, Australian and Allied airmen who spent time in Bomber Command, 55,537 of them, or 44 per cent, tragically lost their lives, with another 9,838 ending up as prisoners of war. Of the more than 10,000 Australian airmen who served in Bomber Command between 1939 and 1945, 3,486 died in action. Many of these men were trained by the

           There are some remarkable stories of heroism by the Australians in Bomber Command, such as Group Captain Hughie Edwards, who won the

Frank flew four operational missions over Europe in Lancasters and flew three supply drops to the Dutch, where he dropped medicine and food, all as part of 460 Squadron Bomber Command and all before his 21st birthday, between the years 1943 and 1945. After this he was remustered back to Australia to join Australian forces as we prepared to take on the Japanese.

            . It evokes the tails of planes, but it also has a modern edge about it. It is a beautiful piece of art and a beautiful memorial. At that ceremony there were also a number of deeply moving speeches, and members of Bomber Command, their families and friends had an opportunity to get together and relive the old times and share memories. It was a wonderfully moving but also inclusive, warm and friendly service.

            and the air missions flown over occupied Europe. The British wing of the Allied war effort was known as Bomber Command, and the Bomber Command Annual Commemorative Day recognises their valiant efforts. Bomber Command played an absolutely critical role in defeating

            These were missions that tragically killed over 44,000 men and the tragic loss of life reflects the bravery and sacrifice of the men who flew these missions. About 10,000 Australian airmen served with the Royal

            's Bomber Command during the

             World War II
            </a>
            , and of these almost 3,500 were killed in action and some 650 died in training accidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the middle of the war Bomber Command crews had just a one in four chance of surviving 30 missions. The crews of Bomber Command were mostly volunteers and they were mostly very young men. Most of these men were barely 20 years old, and there were crewmen who had just turned 18. They flew extremely dangerous missions over occupied and heavily defended parts of Europe. The role they played in disrupting the shipping and troop movements of the Nazis was a significant factor in the survival of

            and arguably the free world in the 1940s.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is now 70 years since many young men flew as pilots, navigators, gunners and air crewman in a battle that was pivotal to the outcome of the

             Second World War
            </a>
            . When our Bomber Command veterans went to London to pay tribute to their mates who lost their lives in missions over Germany, it was an emotional and memorable experience. I understand that over 100 Australian veterans travelled to London to attend the 70th anniversary commemorations and that they were supported by the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            We owe a tremendous debt to the thousands of Australian men who gave their lives in defending us in World War II. I honour those brave and very young bomber commanders. Lest we forget.

              Southern Rhodesia
             </a>
             , now modern Zimbabwe. A number of Australians in Bomber Command were in the RAF, having joined that force before the war, or went specifically to Britain to do so, as many young men did in the early part of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             As I mentioned, Bomber Command was always a multinational force. Aircrews were a mixture of men from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>
             and many other countries. Even in the designated RAAF bomber squadrons, about 30 per cent of aircrew were non-Australian. From 1941 on, men from the RAAF flew with virtually every RAF bomber squadron. Australia also provided some RAAF ground crew for the Australian squadrons, although most support and administrative tasks were carried out by local personnel. Australians served in all bomber aircrew musterings as pilots, navigators, flight engineers, bomb aimers, wireless operators and air gunners. A number rose to be squadron leaders and wing commanders, and served with distinction.

            <p>
             As has been mentioned by other speakers regarding the nature of casualties with respect to Bomber Command, it was a very tragic and difficult part of the armed services. Casualty numbers were huge. Of some 125,000 aircrew, around 55,000, or some 44 per cent, were killed on air operations. Of these, 3,486 were Australian airmen—a casualty rate of 35 per cent for RAAF bomber aircrew and nearly nine per cent of the total
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">

             dead, as recorded on the roll of honour at the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
              Australian War Memorial

             . Also, more than 650 died on operational training in Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently it was great to see pictures from the United Kingdom, where the dedication of the Bomber Command memorial took place. This was mentioned by earlier speakers. A delegation of veterans attended and they were supported by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
              Department of Veterans Affairs
             </a>
             . There have been some issues raised with respect to elements of support provided for those who were, if you like, additional veterans who went beyond the official delegation. I understand that some of those issues are being looked at. The support provided to veterans beyond the official mission was something I started when I was minister with respect to the dedication of some fighter squadron plaques at the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Air Force
             </a>
             church in London. Previously no government had provided additional support beyond official delegations in order to allow additional veterans to attend. It was a process which was criticised at the time, but it was done in conjunction with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Association" rel="nofollow">
              Air Force Association
             </a>
             . A similar process was endeavoured to be built upon on this occasion. Although there were difficulties which need to be looked at, the fact is that additional support had not been provided before. It was an attempt to ensure that more veterans were able to take part. It is something which I think needs to be worked on into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
             To all those who served, we give the nation's grateful thanks. We remember all those who made the ultimate sacrifice and their families, who have suffered subsequently. They fought in a war which consumed a world and gave their all. We stand here today to honour their memory and their suffering. We wish that all who see that Bomber Command memorial in London will remember the tremendous courage, the tremendous sacrifice and the tremendous tragedy of those who fought in World War II in Bomber Command on behalf of the free world.
