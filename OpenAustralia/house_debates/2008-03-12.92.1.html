        In moving that the report be adopted, may I apologise to honourable members. This ordinarily would have occurred much earlier but it awaited the passage of the new standing orders. I also place on record my appreciation of the Chief Opposition Whip. We needed to negotiate somewhat blind as to what the actual standing orders were and I very much appreciate his cooperation. I point out to all honourable members that, of course, the Chief Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Fairfax, concurs with this report.
