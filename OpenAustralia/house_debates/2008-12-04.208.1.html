         Wide Bay
        </a>
        Burnett Area Consultative Committee has just bid farewell to its longstanding chair, Bill Trevor, and I commend his service to the organisation and the entire region. Bill is probably best known in his former role of mayor of the Isis shire and for the incredible leadership role he played in the tragic Childers backpacker hostel fire in 2000. Bill’s compassion, common sense and clear thinking came to the fore at that terrible time and, if he was not already, he became a rallying force for the community and a wonderful advocate for regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill is renowned for his capacity to give back to the community, playing a pivotal role in the establishment of the Wide Bay Burnett Regional Organisation of Councils, of which he became the chair, and he has been credited with breathing life back into many chambers of commerce. Bill is also a life member of Apex and a patron of the Scouts movement and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Athletics" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and, under his leadership, the WBB
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC" rel="nofollow">
         ACC
        </a>
        became one of the most dynamic and proactive ACCs in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill was an exceptional candidate for the role of Chair of the WBBACC having been a farmer, sportsman, lifelong resident of the region, councillor and mayor of Isis shire. In fact, Bill only stepped down from his role as mayor at the recent local government elections. Under his leadership, the ACC delivered many millions of dollars in economic and community capacity-building projects across the entire region. Bill championed regional building projects of all shapes and sizes, from a new skate park precinct at Eidsvold through to the expansion of facilities at the Abbotsleigh Citrus orchard near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Gin" rel="nofollow">
         Gin Gin
        </a>
        and a community service centre at Murgon. Bill was also involved in the unique Bundaberg Futures program which I negotiated with the former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson. It took the redundant Austoft cane harvester site in North Bundaberg and turned it into a leading manufacturing and engineering hub now employing over 250 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        For 12 years Bill gave up an enormous part of his life for the wider community—something all too rare these days. Last year he was one of only eight ACC chairs to be recognised with a 10-year medal. Quite simply, he has set an example of leadership which is the envy of ACCs around Australia. He displayed excellent judgement in being able to encourage and work up projects which have helped the entire Wide Bay area’s social and economic development. To have maintained such strong leadership over so long a period is as inspiring as it is remarkable, and he has set a high standard for others to follow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course Bill did not achieve all this single-handedly. He had the backup and support of a great team, including his Deputy Chair Donna Neilson, Syd Collins,

        and Joy Jensen.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his mayoral role, Bill took an innovative approach to road building, encouraged civic restoration, brought new businesses and quality urban developments into his shire and even built a stadium in conjunction with the state government which doubles as a sports venue and a high school assembly hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now Bill is taking a break from his public career of 23 years, he intends to take advantage of some quality time with his grandchildren, get his hands dirty again on the family farm and even squeeze in an extended holiday to Europe next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill’s stewardship and vision have helped create better services, a better lifestyle and more jobs for the people of the Wide Bay Burnett area, and his presence within the organisation will be greatly missed by all. I went to Nanango in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">
         South Burnett
        </a>
        on Sunday night where Bill was surrounded by 40 or 50 of his colleagues and friends from the ACC. The praise and credit that was attributed to him was quite inspiring and I rate him as a friend, a colleague and an inspirational character in our district.
