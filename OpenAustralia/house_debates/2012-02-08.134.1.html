        I rise today, Mr Speaker, to acknowledge some very special members of our local Dickson community.

        works tirelessly as a fundraiser, in particular for the annual Picnic in the Park raising funds for our local chaplains so that they can continue their vital work in our community. Shannon Yeardley, a former psychologist, has set up 'the flower project' on Brisbane's north side. In the last year, mostly at her expense, she has delivered surprise flower bouquets to over 300 elderly or isolated women, those recovering from illness and devoted carers. Shannon believes: 'The more that you give to other people, the better you feel in yourself.' May Willis has made a lifetime of contributions supporting her community, volunteering endless hours sewing and knitting for fundraisers, for babies in hospital nurseries and for charities like the

        Reverend Dr Paul Inglis is well known for his decade of service as Minister of the Dayboro Uniting Church. He has worked to bring all community churches together to support Dayboro and surrounding regions. During the January 2011 Dayboro Flood, he not only provided support but also organised a fundraising concert with others that help to raise $32,000. As Queensland's first breast care nurse, Patricia Creed

        Sergeant Ken Robinson and Senior Constable Troy Nowitzki are two of many men and women who deserve to be recognised for the role they play in their jobs in our community. To undertake a policing career takes courage, integrity and a genuine concern for the wellbeing of others and, like so many in the emergency services, they go beyond the call of duty. They worked tirelessly in extreme conditions during the 2011 floods to ensure the safety of residents and of course this support and concern continued on after the danger had subsided. I want to congratulate Troy, who has just been promoted to sergeant, and is moving—to all places—St George next week. It is certainly a loss to our community. He will certainly have his work cut out for him in what are very difficult circumstances, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of St George and others affected by terrible floods in western Queensland this very day.

        Long before the floods, Juliette Wright set about helping people in the community facing hardship. She developed the Givit direct giving network website, and charities and organisations can now request any item, goods or service they are currently unable to provide and this request is matched with those who can meet the request.

        Getting kids active and involved in sport is very important. Thankfully, we have Stephen Koster or 'Coach Steve', who has given his time and energy to build the confidence of over 600 children and is a well-loved icon amongst many local young sports men and women. Lisa Davis, similarly, in her role as president of the Pine Rivers Swans
