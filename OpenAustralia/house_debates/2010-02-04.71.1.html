I am very pleased to be here talking about our record funding when it comes to nursing homes. I would like to outline how we are building a modern aged-care system for Australia, with more services for older Australians, more funding—

           Thank you, Mr Speaker. We are meeting the challenges of our ageing population also by improving the quality of our aged-care workforce with major investment. I am very pleased the member for Dickson has asked a question particularly in relation to aged care. When the opposition leader was the minister for health, he ripped a whole billion dollars out of the health and hospital system. He was the Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
            Health and Ageing
           </a>
           for a period of four years in which he underfunded both health and aged care.

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order—and reluctantly so, as I am stopping the minister in full stride. The question was about the costs and whether those costs would be passed on to older residents in nursing homes and how much it would be as a result of this big new tax.

             Order! The member for Dickson will resume his seat. The point of order is on the matter of relevance. The minister will relate her material to the question.

              I have already outlined many, many faults with your plans and I have also highlighted our funding arrangements. Also, It has been fully outlined that compensation is available.

              finalise my comments by saying that the Leader of the Opposition, the former Minister for

               Health and Ageing

              , ripped a billion dollars out of the health and aged-care sector. By standing up in this place and making comments in relation to the future of our aged-care system, the member for Dickson highlights his sheer audacity and the extremely inefficient job the Leader of the Opposition did when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing.
