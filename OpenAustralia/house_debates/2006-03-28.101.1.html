       <p>
        Recently, the Australian Advertising Standards Bureau received numerous complaint letters regarding a certain television commercial. As a result of the complaints, the television commercial is no longer being broadcast. The commercial featured a young professional man who climbed onto the top of a moving bus and then car surfed for some distance before being catapulted off the bus into the surf. The advertising watchdog organisation agreed with the concerns expressed by the public that the depiction of the car surfing had the potential to influence viewers to do the same thing. While the depiction in the commercial itself was relatively harmless, in the real world car surfing is very dangerous and one mistake will almost certainly lead to serious injury or death. Even at low speeds, a car surfer can lose balance and fall awkwardly. A knock to the head can cause irreparable injury.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital that all people, our youth in particular, are strongly discouraged from car surfing. There have been several car surfing incidents that have been reported in recent years in the local media in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        . On the weekend just passed, a young man from Landsborough became the victim of a similar situation. He had jumped onto the back of a slow-moving freight train to hitch a ride home late on Friday night. Tragically, as the train failed to slow down at his usual stop, he jumped off, he landed hard and he suffered fatal injuries. As a father, my heart goes out to the family of that young man.
       </p>
       <p>
        Younger Australians will always be adventurous. They are enthusiastic about life. They are determined to experience new things and learn about life. The majority of them are living at home and are free of many of the burdens that come with raising a family and having to meet the demands of a mortgage. They are in the prime of their lives and enjoying all of the experiences that life has to offer, and of course that is the way that it should be. However, as I have said in this House on at least one previous occasion, our children do need the advice of parents to help guide them to become well developed, mature, adult citizens, but they also must be allowed to have their own experiences and make their own mistakes. Mistakes are perhaps the most important learning tool we have, though we do not enjoy making them. They help us develop and we often look back on our mistakes and give thanks for what we have learnt through them. But car surfing or train surfing are experiences we hope that people will not attempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must sit down with young people and talk to them, explain the dangers, explain the physics, if we have to, of the human body being at the mercy of forces of motion and of gravity and let the tragedies of the past help us to teach young Australians that car surfing or train surfing is not cool, that it is dangerous and can be potentially fatal. The media—television shows, advertisements and even movies—must act responsibly and ban any portrayals of car surfing. The media is very influential but the influence must be for the good rather than irresponsible. Lives of young Australians depend on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parenthood is perhaps the most difficult job in the world and, if that is not the case, it is certainly very close to the top of the list. It is important that the media outlets, which are entertaining our young people, are also mindful of the power that they have and ensure that they assign considerable importance to the needs of young Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Younger Australians are an important section of the community on the Sunshine Coast, which is celebrating another successful Mooloolaba triathlon which occurred last Sunday. I know my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Fairfax, who is in the chair, also closely follows the Mooloolaba triathlon which used to be in his electorate previously. Sadly, neither the honourable member for Fairfax nor I had the opportunity of participating this year.

          It is a shame. It is one of those aspirational situations which, I suspect, will never come to fruition. This year the event again attracted some 3,000 competitors from those who are keen to take part in an exciting community event through to those professionals who live for the race and the spoils of victory. The lead-up to this year’s triathlon was one of most uncertain in the in the event’s 14-year history. The presence of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Wati" rel="nofollow">
           Cyclone Wati
          </a>
          off the Queensland coast had whipped up big seas and there was concern for the safety of competitors during the swim leg. Organisers instead decided to move the swim leg into the nearby

          ensuring that it could all go ahead as planned without undue worry about the weather.
         </p>
         <p>
          As it turned out, as is mostly the case in Queensland, the sun came out and the event was held on a glorious day. Media reports suggest that some 15,000 people came and lined the streets of Mooloolaba to watch the event. In fact the congestion was so bad it was difficult to get from some parts of the central
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
           Sunshine Coast
          </a>
          to other parts of the coast. Many people were able to enjoy the coffee shops and restaurants along the esplanade and we, on the Sunshine Coast, are now privileged to have al fresco dining in so many areas. The restaurants and coffee shops are located adjacent to what is undoubtedly one of the best beaches in Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          The event itself is always very entertaining and this year’s event was no exception. The winner of the men’s race was

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
           Commonwealth Games
          </a>
          in Melbourne just over a week before. After the race, Docherty admitted that he had felt like giving up midway through but his competitive edge drove him forward to victory. The women’s winner was Australia’s Annabel Luxford, who had also competed in the Commonwealth Games where she had finished fifth, a position that she herself was disappointed in. But her disappointment at the games was soon overshadowed by her wonderful win at Mooloolaba. As a result of her victory, she is now ranked No. 1 in the world. Both the winners took away $14,000 in prize money and Mooloolaba itself took away that sense of honour and pride when communities work together to stage a successful event. Organiser, Garth Proud of United Sports Marketing, should once again be congratulated, along with his team, for putting together such a world-class sports spectacular. The Mooloolaba triathlon delivers a massive windfall to the local tourism economy. It delivers a second time over through the worldwide broadcast of the event and the region on television. So many people in different parts of the world see the wonderful attractions that the Sunshine Coast has to offer and hopefully many people will come to our area as tourists when they get the opportunity.

          I am very proud to be part of a community that so strongly supports its tourism industry. This is an industry that depends on visitors from Brisbane, which is just about an hour’s drive from the south, from interstate and from overseas. Figures from the hard-working Tourism Sunshine Coast organisation indicate that annual domestic visitors increased from around 2.5 million in June 2004 to 2.8 million in June last year. This is a rise of more than nine per cent. That is quite an outstanding result for the Sunshine Coast. Also, international visitors to the Sunshine Coast region increased from just under 230,000 in mid-2004 to almost 250,000 by June last year. This is an increase of some eight per cent.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to see more of the international visitors who come to Queensland come to the Sunshine Coast. I do not think we are currently getting our fair share of the international market and we hope that that will improve in the future. There has been an increase of some 18,386 international visitors over that two-year period, which is a testament to Tourism Sunshine Coast and to the very many other tourism organisations in the area. The international visitors come mainly from New Zealand, with 34 per cent; athletes from New Zealand also make up a considerable proportion of entrants in the triathlon each year.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
           The United Kingdom
          </a>
          produces 23 per cent of local international visitors and Europe 17 per cent. Sporting events like the Mooloolaba triathlon that get international media coverage can only help to spread the word about the fantastic tourist attractions that the Sunshine Coast region has to offer. And I am anticipating more good things for tourism in my electorate and in the more general Sunshine Coast area in the months ahead.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good things continue to come for the latest major tourist attraction to come to the Sunshine Coast, the ex

          , which was sunk as a dive wreck last July off the Mooloolaba area. Very early on, dive operators reported a very high demand for visits to the vessel. Between 10,000 and 15,000 scuba tourists were initially expected to visit the wreck each year, and these figures have proven so far to be quite accurate. Two of the dive operators in my electorate are among those granted licences to make trips to the wreck. They are Mooloolaba based Sunreef Scuba Diving Services, owned by Greg Riddell and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_White" rel="nofollow">
           Paul White
          </a>
          , and Scuba World, owned by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKinnon" rel="nofollow">
           Ian McKinnon
          </a>
          . Again I pay tribute to the wonderful role played by these two businesses in helping to have the dive wreck sunk off the Sunshine Coast. They have reported that around 1,000 dive tourists visited the wreck each month during summer. Even though, in the colder months that have come, the number of visitors to the wreck has reduced somewhat, it is still around 800 per month. The spin-offs for the economy are expected to be around $40 million each year. I am particularly proud to have played a role in securing the vessel for the Sunshine Coast. It is, I am sure you would agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, a great privilege to serve the Sunshine Coast in the parliament of Australia.
