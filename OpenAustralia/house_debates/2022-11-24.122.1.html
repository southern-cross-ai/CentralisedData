         I thank the member for Wills for his question and his ongoing commitment to fighting climate change and his deep commitment to national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing is more central to the security and wellbeing of the Pacific than taking action on climate change, because the Pacific is bearing the brunt of climate change. In Australia we've seen bushfires, droughts and the current massive floods. In the Pacific island countries we're seeing inundation, water contamination and threats to food security. That's why the 2018 Boe Declaration said climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific. For example, Kiribati's main island, Tarawa, will lose 50 per cent of its landmass by 2100 under current projections.

         27, Australia's response was really well received. I met with 10 Pacific leaders and ministers, including the prime ministers of the

         said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is taking a new refreshed approach to its relationship with the Pacific, and it's reinforcing that, not just with words, but also with some real solid action.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're working with the Pacific to deliver outcomes that reflect Pacific interest. We supported Pacific climate negotiators to be there and to progress a bid for COP in the Pacific. After a decade of inaction, Australia is taking action at home and abroad. We're supporting the Pacific climate facility. We're providing $900 million worth of extra
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         to the Pacific with a real focus on climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was also asked how the approach has changed from the last government. The Albanese government has delivered more in six months than the last government did in 10 years. For example, we're not making jokes about climate change destroying Pacific island countries; we're taking this existential threat seriously. We're not blowing up regional security and unity like the member for Cook did by blocking action on climate change at the 2019 PIF.

           The minister's answer offends against several provisions of the standing orders. In particular, on relevance, you have previously directed a minister back to the question when he has strayed and gone into the record of the previous government.

             To the point of order: in terms of the way the minister is answering this question, he's being quite specific about what the government's doing and not doing. Every part of it has been framed in terms of decisions being taken by the government and that he has taken as minister.

               In contrast to the last government, which blocked climate action—which led to Fiji Prime Minister Bainimarama saying that the former Prime Minister's actions were insulting, were condescending and would drive the Pacific to countries other than Australia—the new government is supporting action on climate change and supporting the Pacific. The opposition like to claim they're strong on national security, but being weak on climate and being weak on the Pacific means they are weak on national security. Unfortunately, the opposition leader's attacks on climate action—his dog-whistling on
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP" rel="nofollow">

               , in particular on damage and loss, demonstrates the opposition leader doesn't understand national security, isn't fit to lead his party and is definitely not fit to lead this nation.
