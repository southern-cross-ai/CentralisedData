        My question is to the Prime Minister. The government has committed to spending $368 billion on acquiring nuclear powered submarines when people are struggling to pay the grocery bills, yet we still don't know the full cost to taxpayers and where and how the nuclear waste will be stored. What will it cost our taxpayers to manage this nuclear waste, and will Australia be accepting any nuclear waste from other AUKUS countries under the agreement?

         I thank the member for her questionâ€”the first question on AUKUS I've got from anyone on the other side. This is a very significant announcement, and we put up the fact that over a period of decades the cost will be between $268 billion and $368 billion. Under that arrangement Australia will be responsible at the end of life, when the nuclear fuel cell is depleted, for the storage of that, and we've said it will be on Defence land. I can confirm that there is no responsibility to store anyone else's waste, a responsibility to store what effectively will be our own, because what the plan is here is for us to build these subs in Adelaide. And once the Australian flag is on a submarine, like once the Australian flag is on a plane or on any other piece of equipment, it is our responsibility and we are in control. That is a part of our national sovereignty that I hope that the member opposite would agree is important.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the issue on the economy is important, to say this: unless our national security is looked after then the impact on our economy, on our society, on everything else falls away, and that is why expenditure and investment in our national sovereignty is so important, is so absolutely vital. And I don't apologise for making a commitment that will see our defence expenditure rise over future years. The truth is, we live in an era of strategic competition in our region. The truth is we live in very uncertain times. And it is important that we invest in our capability. It's also important that we invest in our relationships. My government is doing both. We are investing in our capability, whether it be nuclear powered submarines or whether it be other military equipment that will improve our capability. Next month we will be releasing the Defence Strategic Review that will outline the work of Sir Angus Houston and

         . But that is an important priority for us going forward. We make no apologies for that. But at the same time, we're also building positive and constructive relationships to advance peace, security and stability in our region.
