        (a) safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of Australians;

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (a) additional funding for the new $9.3 billion National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness (including a doubling of Commonwealth homelessness funding to $400 million every year, matched by states and territories);

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (a) two and half years since the further illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Ukrainian military forces continue to bravely defend their homeland;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australia risks, again, falling behind like-minded partners in supporting Ukraine unless the Government moves to quickly back the G7 agreement of a $50 billion

         USD

        loan for Ukraine obtained through frozen Russian assets;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) having claimed legal difficulties as justification to not use Russian assets, the Government now needs to stop finding excuses to not support Ukraine and wholeheartedly commit to doing all that Australia possibly can;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) unlike the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada and France, Australia has not yet made any contribution to the unfolding global debate to the transfer of funds from Russia's frozen assets to Ukraine to assist with their war effort;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) if Australia's laws need amending to better target Russian assets or make more effective sanctions on Russia, then the Opposition will support sensible amendments to facilitate this;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the Opposition, since the beginning of Russia's abhorrent and illegal further invasion of Ukraine, has offered full bipartisan support to the Government to implement all possible mechanisms that would aid Ukraine's self-defence;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) instead of acting wherever it can to assist Ukraine, the Government has let Australia's relative support decline by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) junking Taipan military helicopters;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) refusing assistance by not sending Hawkeii protected mobility vehicles;
       </p>

        (iii) ignoring calls to reinstate Australia's embassy in Kyiv; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) turning down requests for coal; and
