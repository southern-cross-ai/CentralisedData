       <p>
        Today I rise to acknowledge a wonderfully generous individual who has been a truly invaluable active member of our northern beaches community for countless years. Genevieve Allen is the daughter of Berenice and John Perriman of Woollahra,

        . After her father had returned to London, Genevieve's supportive mother raised and educated her with singular dedication. Inspired by the fortitude of her mother, Genevieve embarked on a nursing career in 1955, attending the Preliminary Training School at

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        She met

        in her last year at the school and they married in 1960. Genevieve remained in the medical field, however, working alongside her husband at his optometry practice. She describes her husband as a bit of an entrepreneur. He expanded his practice across the inner western suburbs. John believed that wives should be involved in business if so inclined. She fondly recalled, 'He even had me delivering sunglasses when I was pregnant.'

        After Genevieve and John had welcomed a daughter and a son into the world, John added a photographic lab to their portfolio and encouraged Genevieve to travel to Melbourne to learn the process in order to run the business. She proved so successful as a businesswoman that they opened a second franchise. Eventually they sold their business and reinvested in the aged-care sector, purchasing three nursing homes. After their children had married and left home, they decided to sell their business to travel before retiring to

        in 1979.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keen to contribute to her community, Genevieve joined the Palm Beach Liberal Party, as did John. After a few years she successfully ran for branch president, marking the start of a 19-year tenure as president in the branch. Genevieve only recently retired as a member of the branch executive. Genevieve worked tirelessly to organise many fundraisers for worthy causes. She was also elected President of the Pittwater

        , a position she held for two years. Genevieve Allen also remained active in the democratic process, organising staff at polling booths during many state and federal elections.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm delighted to note that Genevieve and John recently celebrated their 60th anniversary. No couple is more deserving. Everyone who knows Genevieve would agree when I say that she is a strong, kind-hearted and compassionate member of our beautiful northern beaches community. I'd like to thank her for her generous spirit and her extraordinary commitment and contribution to the Mackellar electorate and our party.
