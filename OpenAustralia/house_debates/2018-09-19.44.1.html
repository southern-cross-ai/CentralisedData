       <p>
        I am pleased to update the House on the matter that I raised in this place last week when I called on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government to do whatever it takes to get the dredging of the Ettalong Channel done. It has been too long. I'm pleased to say that the New South Wales government has now announced funding of $1.225 million for the dredging of the channel, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        also contributing up to the same amount. I congratulate the state member for Terrigal, Adam Crouch, and Taylor Martin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        on their work to secure this commitment to a longer-term solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local businesses and residents are also pleased with this announcement but understandably are still very concerned about the need for the dredging to be completed as soon as possible. Local resident Diane Blackbourne said on Facebook: 'So many of us are frustrated at the slowness of this dredging.' Sarah Wade, a local business owner, said: 'I'm the business owner of Cosy Home Ettalong Beach. My first 18 months were sensational, but the last five months since the ferries stopped have been a disaster.' I've received hundreds of other comments like these.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local residents are crying out, saying enough is enough. I continue to encourage ongoing consultation with the local businesses and residents who are suffering every day that the channel is not dredged. The funding is a welcome announcement, and I thank the New South Wales government for this important next step, but we still need to continue to work together diligently, night and day if need be, on this issue for the sake of local businesses and residents. Thanks for the funding. Now let's get it done.
