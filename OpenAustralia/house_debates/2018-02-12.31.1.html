        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of my constituents, Mrs Linda Rowan, who received an Order of Australia for services to aged welfare. With 41 years of dedicated work in the Beenleigh region, Mrs Rowan is a long-time servant of the Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre. In her 41 years of work, Mrs Rowan has played a major role with the centre, as well as with the local Meals on Wheels. She began working with Meals on Wheels as a volunteer back in 1976 and eventually went on to become their coordinator. In that time she was also appointed the welfare officer for the Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre in 1986, a position she held until her retirement in 2016. Although she has not long retired from her role with the centre after 40 years, Mrs Rohan remains committed to serving the local community and still has plenty of time left to volunteer. Linda continues to serve as the honorary treasurer and has returned to volunteering to deliver for Meals on Wheels. I'd like to thank Linda for being such a tremendous figure in the Beenleigh community and thank her for the many years of service that she has contributed. Linda has contributed countless hours to making the Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre, which prides itself as one of the best facilities in Queensland for the over-50s, the place it is today. I give my congratulations to Linda and my thanks for the wonderful work she does.
