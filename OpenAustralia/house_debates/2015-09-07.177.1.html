        hosted a start-up weekend for 36 year 10 to year 12 students. The remarkable thing was that one of the judges there was Sally-

        , from Google, who is known to many in this place. She has attended these start-up weekends, which are a collaboration of ideas. Teams get together on a Friday, pitch an idea, form a group and then work hard over the weekend at home and at the uni to pitch an idea to venture capitalists that could actually turn into a Google.

It came up because of a lived experience with his sister, who had to fill out all this paperwork. So congratulations to the team and to Graeme Breen, who is leading the way with the digital economy on the Sunshine Coast. Thank you to the
