        were both awarded the Victoria Cross, a decoration that accords recognition to a person who 'perform acts of the most conspicuous gallantry, acts of valour or self-sacrifice, or display extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy'.

        Both of these young men attended Dudley Primary School. The school is extremely proud of them. Just a couple of weeks short of his 23rd birthday Captain Clarence Smith Jeffries was posthumously awarded with the Victoria Cross, following his actions in battle. Also awarded the Victoria Cross was Private William Matthew Currey, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery and daring in the attack on Peronne on the morning of 1 September 1918. He was aged 22. The school holds both of these young men close to their hearts and they are very proud of their actions.
