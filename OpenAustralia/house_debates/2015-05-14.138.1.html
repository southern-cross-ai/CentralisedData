       <p>
        On 25 April, our community remembered those who served our nation and lost their lives in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        and subsequent wars, through the Centenary of Anzac tributes in

        </a>
        . On behalf of the community, I wish to thank and congratulate those from our area who were involved in the organisation and coordination of events that commemorated the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli. In particular, I pay tribute to and thank the members of the Kingsford Smith Centenary of Anzac committee: Tony Waller, Ann Slattery, Ronnie Davison,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cohen" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Perry" rel="nofollow">
         Roger Perry
        </a>
        , Pam Richardson, Colin Flatters and Neil Lee. These dedicated men and women worked hard for 18 months to organise, scrutinise and allocate funding for Centenary of Anzac projects and commemorations in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of those projects include the upgrading of the Light Horse War Memorial at Eastlakes—it was one of the staging posts and training grounds for light horse brigades prior to going to World War I—and the establishment of commemorative plaques on streets in our community that are named after World War I Victoria Cross winners and significant achievers. The Coogee Legion Club held a Centenary of Anzac breakfast. The combined dawn service at

        saw 12,000 people come together in our community to watch the sunrise and pay tribute to those who had served our nation. Our community made a contribution to the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        undertook a project with the Chifley Public School to create a commemorative garden in memory of those who served. These are all very worthwhile and wonderful projects, and I thank the organisations involved in establishing those projects to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac—in particular, the RSLs and local schools, and a special mention to the Windgap choir, who once again performed at the Botany RSL Anzac march.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have often said in this place and in the chamber that the best thing about our community is the close-knit nature of people and the sense of community, and that really shone through in our Centenary of Anzac celebrations. Once again, I pay tribute and thank those who were involved in commemorating those who served our nation. Lest we forget.
