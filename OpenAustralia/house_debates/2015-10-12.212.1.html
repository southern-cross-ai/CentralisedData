        I rise to acknowledge some of the many wonderful things that happened in my electorate of Bendigo over the weekend. Let's start with the Heritage Uncorked event that happened on Friday night. Over 200 people sampled and celebrated the very best of Bendigo wine. What also occurred on the weekend was the absolutely wonderful play that was put on, called

        . Bendigo playwright Margaret Hickey wrote the play, and it was directed by Matt Emond. It starred Sally-Anne Upton. This was a beautiful play consisting of a series of monologues based upon characters and observations from Ms Hickey, which she had picked up when she grew up in Bendigo. There was also a bike-riding competition as well as a netball competition, just some of the many events that occurred in our town over the weekend. There was also the Bendigo farmers market, which sold out of much of its local produce.
