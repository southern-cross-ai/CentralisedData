        was a friend of mine, but, more importantly, he was a friend of my community. He died recently, and I want to pay tribute to him in the parliament. He was a veteran of the

         Royal Australian Air Force

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He then served the community in the

         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        , rising to the rank of detective inspector of the major crimes squad. Of course, he continued to give to the community after retirement. Since 1995 he held many positions within the

         Returned and Services League
        </a>
        and served as president of the Smithfield

        sub-branch for 12 years until 2014, and it's in that capacity that I came to know him. I also want to take the opportunity to say that my predecessor, the Hon. Janice Crosio AM,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">
         MBE
        </a>
        , was a very good friend of Bill Newell's, and she would want me to pass on her condolences in the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill was a very, very good man and a good friend of mine, and he continued to live in the community right up until his death. He lived at the Pemulwuy nursing home, and I was very pleased to be able to call in and chat with him from time to time at the nursing home and recall old times. I remember he told me about the time that, at the police station, somebody arrived to brief him on the latest development in policing: the introduction of a computer. He said some of his colleagues thought it wouldn't take off, but he thought that the computer had some potential both in law enforcement and elsewhere. It was appropriate that he was awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in 2015 in recognition of his service to veterans and their families, and I was very pleased to be able to write in support of his nomination for a Medal of the Order of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was particularly dedicated to the commemoration of Battle for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        . Battle for Australia Day is a day now commemorated in many RSL clubs, but Smithfield RSL was the first in Australia to recognise Battle for Australia Day. It was the idea of another now departed veteran—Mr Alex Peken, who I've previously paid tribute to in this House—but Bill, as president, took it up. Battle for Australia Day at Smithfield RSL is now a very important commemoration and is widely regarded within the RSL community as the third most important commemoration after Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        , and it was first commemorated at Smithfield RSL. His drive and enthusiasm made Battle for Australia Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was also very important in the bowls community. In 2009 he was awarded the meritorious service badge by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW

        RSL Lawn Bowls Association as a result of his dedication to the sport, serving as national umpire, secretary and eventually treasurer to the local zone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pass on my condolences to his widow, Minn, whom I know, of course, very, very well—she was his rock in his final years—and to his extended family. I was pleased to attend his 90th birthday at Smithfield RSL three years ago. I'm sorry he's no longer with us. I miss him every day. Our community misses him. Rest in peace, Bill Newell.
