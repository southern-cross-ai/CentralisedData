       <p>
        I rise today to raise two particular issues of concern to the Dunkley community. You could be forgiven for thinking it is groundhog day. Ten years ago our community rallied and fought to protect the Playne Street post office in Frankston from plans by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        to close it and relocate it to a far less acceptable location. We are there again! There are plans by Australia Post to close not only the Playne Street post office but also the more retail focused outlet in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayside_Shopping_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Bayside Shopping Centre
        </a>
        in Frankston and to consolidate those two activities in Wells Street at the former Dr Edelsten building opposite the new cinema and entertainment complex.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can understand the rationale for closing the Bayside retail outlet. There was a decision some time ago to move it from a very popular, high-exposure and, I understand, very high rent area in the complex to a far more distant corner of the Bayside complex. It has seen a significant reduction in retail activity and not the take-up of post office box opportunities that people really hoped for. That I can understand, and I can completely understand the proposal to consolidate that somewhere and to make it more attractive as a retail proposition. The idea of shutting Playne Street post office, though, just leaves me completely bewildered. Since the last time we had this battle 10 years ago, I obviously have not learnt much. It bewildered me then and it still bewilders me now. The local community, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Commerce" rel="nofollow">
         Chamber of Commerce
        </a>
        and Councillor Christine Richards are just a handful of those who are confused and anxious about what the future plans look like.
       </p>
       <p>
        As yet, there has been no commitment to actually shut Playne Street, but it certainly is on the radar screen. The idea that the retail activity in the Bayside Shopping Centre and the mainly business bulk mail post office box activity at Playne Street could be brought together in a central location in Frankston may have some theoretical appeal. But all I say to people is, ‘Road test the proposition.’ Wells Street in Frankston, which runs through the middle of the central activities district, has actually had some excellent work done on improving its street amenity and its presentation. There are not too many car parks there, though. The idea is to move that post office, where many of the customers of the post office boxes are from the greater Frankston area. They drive to the current venue. It is on the southern edge of the CBD. You can nip in to the post office. There is angle parking on both sides, and there are a couple of park and ride parks as well that have been provided by the council. It all works quite well. But to move that kind of concept into the middle of town is not a well-thought through proposition. If you are fortunate enough to get a car park in one of the three that are in front of not just this premise but the whole complex along Wells Street, you would be doing well. You would have to take a chance with the three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
         ATM
        </a>
        s, the other business activity and the like. The 1,000 or so post office box holders could have a raffle to see who got to use those rare, scarce car parking places—that is, if those places were made available. Frankston City has made it absolutely clear that it has not made any commitment to make those car parking places available for the exclusive use of Australia Post. This idea needs to be re-examined.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are lucky enough to get a car park, you have then got to get out of the central area. Wells Street would see you heading towards the railway station and there is no way other than to turn left, which would take you for a nice scenic drive past the front of the railway station and the bus interchange and then you might be able to escape. Alternatively, you would go down
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Lane" rel="nofollow">
         Park Lane
        </a>
        and through the little rat run behind the entertainment complex. That does not look like a sound traffic management proposition either.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been encouraged by the willingness of the Australia Post commercial manager to discuss these issues, but the uncertainty about Australia Post’s actual plans is causing great anxiety in the community. I believe Playne Street needs to stay. I understand that there is an argument for the retail activity moving out of the shopping centre because of rental costs, but we need to think carefully about the nature of the customers, the use of the facility in Playne Street and all the arguments we had 10 years ago, and say that we need to maintain the functionality of those premises. Car parking, traffic movement, ease of access and the popularity of the post office boxes underline the very simple fact that where it is now works. The customers shop with their feet, they can park their vehicles, and they have all of their needs met without going into the heart of the CBD. It is a positive tenant to have on the southern side of the Frankston city area. The council is actively engaged, the Chamber of Commerce is engaged and so am I. I would encourage Australia Post to carefully consult with their clients and customers who make the Playne Street premises one of their most viable and financially profitable outlets in greater Melbourne, and to rethink this plan to make sure that Playne Street can be saved and can continue to serve its very useful purpose for the people of greater Frankston.
