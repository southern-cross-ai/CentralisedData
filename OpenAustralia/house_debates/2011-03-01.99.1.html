       <p>
        Given yesterday’s release of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        ’s preliminary report into the National Disability Insurance Scheme, it is appropriate that further attention is focused on meeting the individual needs and supported accommodation requirements of people living with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bennelong is the home of a large number of disability service organisations and providers of supported accommodation facilities. I have the privilege of representing and interacting with many constituents who are working tirelessly in this important area. These organisations include the Royal Rehabilitation Centre Sydney; Macquarie Hospital; Crowle Homes, which has recently merged with the Achieve Foundation; the Ryde office of the Cerebral Palsy Alliance; the Shepherd Centre; and many smaller, volunteer-run community organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to draw particular attention to Ryde Area Supported Accommodation for Intellectually Disabled, or RASAID. This determined group was formed six years ago by 19 local families who were struggling to secure accommodation and support for their 20 adult sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities. All of them required a high level of care, and some required it around the clock. Like many other parents of children with a disability, the families of RASAID live their lives on a rollercoaster of emotion and fatigue. Most of them are aged 50 or above, with their most senior member still a full-time carer at 87 years of age.
       </p>
       <p>
        The families of RASAID have supported each other for decades. Their adult children have grown up together attending school, day programs, work placements and social groups together. With more than 600 years of combined carers experience these parents are best positioned to advocate for the individual care and accommodation needs of their dependent children. They understand that there is no one-size-fits-all care or accommodation model. Significant funds are required at both the federal and state level. Hopefully the consultation surrounding the National Disability Insurance Scheme will provide guidance and options for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        My great concern is their urgent accommodation and housing needs. Despite the drain on their time, members of RASAID have attended over 60 meetings with state and federal MPs and departmental representatives in an effort to find a solution. I have committed to continue working with my state and federal colleagues, RASAID and other disability service organisations and advocates to determine and pursue all available options to ensure we find suitable and acceptable solutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        My federal colleague and shadow disability minister, Senator Mitch Fifield, has visited Bennelong and met with the families of RASAID and will continue to advocate for their needs. The

        , are campaigning for changes in this area, and I hope that the 26 March election brings this squarely onto the government’s agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to find a way to have the system fit those needing our support through specialist accommodation and not have a system where those with an intellectual or physical disability are required to conform to a bureaucratic standard. We must measure our support systems against international best practice and recognise that a choice of how, where and with whom a person lives should be a right that is afforded to all people. I strongly applaud the tireless efforts of the parents of RASAID and all the carers and those involved in disability services in Bennelong, and I pledge my ongoing support.
