        A few weeks back I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of the Warburton

        station, which has a very rich history. It was great to see all the volunteers who work so hard for the Warburton community through the Warburton CFA. It was a day to celebrate the history of the CFA and a day to look forward to its strong future. At the opening we heard of the rich history of the CFA, which was founded back in January 1915, when the brigade purchased a hand reel with 600 feet of hose, one hydrant and two branches. The equipment was kept under the band rotunda in the main street of Warburton. Of course, since those early days the Warburton CFA has grown. It has done so much for the local community. In fact, it was the only brigade in the Upper

        for a long period of time.
       </p>

        The day of the official opening was a time to recognise some of those who had volunteered so much to the Warburton CFA. Tony van Meurs, the brigade captain, presided with John Peberdy;

A 60-year service medal was presented to Warren Borgas; a 55-year medal to Barry Marshall; a 30-year medal to Peter Reidy, a 25-year medal to Michael Lazarus and Warren Unthank, 10-year medals to Michael Priest; and five-year medals to Hazel Clothier, Valissa Enever, Toby Harty,
