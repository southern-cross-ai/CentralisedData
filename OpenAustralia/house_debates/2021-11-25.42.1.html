        As the proud member for Nicholls in this government, I rise to bring to the House's attention some of the work that the government has recently been delivering for the people of Nicholls. Last week, I was honoured to participate in the opening of the Shepparton Art Museum, a $50 million project that this federal government has contributed $15 million towards, while $15 million has also come from the Greater Shepparton City Council and $7 million from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM" rel="nofollow">
         SAM
        </a>
        Foundation, along with $10 million from the state. SAM will display works from over 200 artists, with 160 Indigenous and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        artworks in addition to a ceramics collection that is unrivalled anywhere else in Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his role in the opening last week.
       </p>
       <p>
        The weekend prior to the opening of the SAM, we also had an opportunity to open the Museum of Vehicle Evolution, better known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE" rel="nofollow">
         MOVE
        </a>
        . MOVE has been transformed after a $5.3 million upgrade, which the federal government contributed $2.5 million towards. MOVE has now been expanded to just under 10,000 square metres. It houses the museum's collection of cars, motorbikes, trucks and vintage clothing and also acknowledges the rich history of transport throughout the

        region. It will now highlight a collection of trucks that will be unrivalled anywhere else in Australia. I wish to acknowledge and congratulate every person in Nicholls that has helped bring these two amazing projects to fruition.
