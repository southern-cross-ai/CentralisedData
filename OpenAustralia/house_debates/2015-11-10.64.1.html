        and Major Projects representing the Minister for Communications. The Whyanbeel community group has been in regular contact with my office because residents and businesses in this area experience very poor internet connectivity. Can the minister please update my constituents as to the progress of the

         I am very pleased to receive that question from the member for Leichhardt, who is a very strong advocate for the needs of his community on a whole range of issues, including the desirability of good internet connectivity. The area that he refers to is one which has not had good internet connectivity—

           And despite the extraordinary extent of promises made by the previous government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government—we saw a disappointing lack of delivery when it came to the provision of internet services under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           in regional and remote areas, including those in the member's electorate of Leichhardt such as Whyanbeel.
          </p>
          <p>
           As you would know, the story in relation to fixed wireless nationally is a very good one. When we came to government only a bit over 40,000 premises were able to connect to fixed wireless. It is now over 300,000 and well on track to half a million. Half a million premises in due course will be able to connect to fixed wireless.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the member's electorate of Leichhardt, where he has been a very, very strong advocate for the connectivity needs of his constituents, there is very good progress being made. I am pleased to report to the House that base stations are under construction, which will provide coverage to Whyanbeel. Already there is a base station operational at Newell Beach and, by the end of this year, base stations at Myola and Julatten will also be operational and able to provide coverage to some 900 premises in the Whyanbeel valley area. Those who are outside the coverage range of the fixed-wireless will have the benefit of the satellite network. The first satellite has been successfully launched and a satellite service is due to commence halfway through next year. The member's constituents in the electorate of Leichhardt have rightly been asking him when they will get service. I am pleased to report that there is strong progress being made because of the Turnbull government's focus on delivery when it comes to the NBN and when it comes to every other aspect of the work of government.
          </p>
          <p>
           The previous government talked a big game when it came to the NBN, but there was very little delivery. By contrast, we are in delivery mode, and I am pleased to say not just nationally but also for the people of Whyanbeel. Fixed wireless is coming. Some have it already and others will have it very soon. The feedback we are getting nationally on the fixed-wireless product is very good. We are delivering nationally when it comes to the internet, and we are delivering to the people of Whyanbeel.
