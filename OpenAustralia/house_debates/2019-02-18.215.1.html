        I rise today to offer my sincerest condolences to Melbourne's Chaldean Catholic Christian community on the passing of their much loved Father Emmanuel Khoshaba. Father Khoshaba was a pioneer. He will be remembered for the love and commitment he dedicated to the Chaldean Catholic Christian community in my electorate of Calwell. Father Khoshaba lived to serve his community. He tended to their spiritual needs, but, more importantly, he also helped them in their settlement processesâ€”because that community is a refugee community, having fled war in Iraq and Syria.
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Khoshaba founded the parish Our Lady Guardian of Plants in the electorate of Calwell, where he served as its first priest from its beginning in 1982. He was instrumental in the building of our magnificent new cathedral of Our Lady Guardian of Plants in Campbellfield, which opened in 2005 and was visited by the Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, and

        for Sunday mass in November 2016. This was a highlight for the church community and, in particular, for Father Khoshaba.
       </p>
       <p>
        I offer my deepest condolences to His Grace Archbishop Amel Nona and the clergy of St Thomas Chaldean &amp; Assyrian Catholic Diocese, the clergy and faithful of Our Lady Guardian of Plants Chaldean Catholic Parish and St George Chaldean Centre in Campbellfield, along with the entire community. Father Khoshaba was a pioneer. He was a man who led his community. He was a man who cared for them and who led them into the settlement process in Australia.
