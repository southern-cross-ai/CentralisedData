        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the steps the government is taking to make Australian society safer, including through the use of section 501 of the Migration Act? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the honourable member for his very important question. It is the case that this government has cancelled a record number of visas under section 501 of the Migration Act—that is, people who were visiting our country and committed an offence while they were here. We take a very tough decision and we boot them out. We cancel their visas and we kick them out. In Labor's last year in government, they cancelled 84 visas. In the last 12 months, we have cancelled 1,013 visas. Included in that is well over 100 outlaw motorcycle gang members. When I look at the categories, I think the motorcycle gang members are included in most of these categories, and we are up in all of these categories: armed robbery, 139 cancellations; assault; drug offences; fraud; deception; grievous bodily harm; reckless injury; kidnapping; manslaughter; murder; other violent offences; theft; robbery; use threat with intent. All of these categories are up dramatically because, I suspect, many of the bikies fall into those categories.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not every Australian is supportive of the work that we are doing in cancelling these visas. In May, it is reported, we had paid
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         organiser Mick Powell and union delegate Stu-e Corkran attend a Rebels protest against the visa cancellation of a Rebels gang member. He may well be an extortionist or a robber, he may well turn up on building sites and muscle subcontractors and all sorts of people in a shocking way, but he is not too smart, our Stu-e, because he turned up in his Rebels outfit—

          <p>
           Look at the drab looks from start to finish on the front bench. Do you know why, Mr Speaker? The CFMEU has donated $10 million to the Labor Party in recent years and they own and operate the Labor Party. Why otherwise would this Leader of the Opposition allow these lawless thugs to go onto building sites and muscle honest and decent subcontractors off those sites? Why would the CFMEU use these bikies as muscle on the building sites? And why would the Labor Party tolerate such action? Because they are owned and operated by the CFMEU. Follow the money. This week, the Leader of the Opposition needs to recognise that Australians are onto his weak leadership. 'Bikie Bill Shorten' needs to realise the Australian people have worked him out.
