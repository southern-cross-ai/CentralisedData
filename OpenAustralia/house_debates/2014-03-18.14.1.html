       <p>
        I rise today in praise of the social development program Camp Cobbold and its many volunteers who provide essential services to families who are geographically disadvantaged in the remote parts of north-west Queensland. Living in Australia's prosperous cities, many are unaware of the hardships occurring in our backyard. Families living in geographical isolation suffer ongoing physical and emotional strain as they work tirelessly to maintain life on the rural properties of Queensland. Over the past five years, Camp Cobbold has aimed to improve the life experiences and outcomes for socially vulnerable members of this community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Camp Cobbold not only offers these families a week-long oasis away from the plight of the bush, but also assists them to develop a sense of self-worth and affirmation for their daily struggles. Offering a diverse program catered towards varied interest groups from infants to adults, Camp Cobbold connects participants with resources, provides opportunities to try new things and develops skills and knowledge that can be invested back into their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supporting the camp is a dedicated leadership team that provides specialist services such as speech therapy and psychology, and the many volunteers, including a large number from the Toowong Uniting Church in my electorate of Ryan, who help facilitate camp activities. I would also like to acknowledge yet again the $10.7 million in the Farm Household Support Bill that we are debating today in this chamber and the importance of that money.
