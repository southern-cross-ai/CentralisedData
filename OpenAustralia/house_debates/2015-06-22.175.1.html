        Highway at Erina that sends a very clear message to drivers heading towards Gosford every morning. It says, 'Police say no to domestic violence and so should you.' Today I would like to do the same. I say no to domestic violence and echo the message coming from my community on the Central Coast that it is fine to have an important public conversation about this devastating issue. Last week was

        Awareness Week on the Central Coast. One of the major events, held yesterday, was Walk the Talk in Gosford. Almost 300 people joined together to walk from Brian McGowan Bridge down to the sailing club in what many have described to me as a poignant moment of solidarity in our community. I regret that I was unable to attend, but I do want to place on record my thanks to and appreciation of event organisers including Mandy Coolen from the Star

        ; and Leanne Livens from Central Coast ADVICE, a group focusing on integrated case-management education. Josie Polar, a student from Lisarow, shared her story from the perspective of being a survivor. Her own family circumstances have been really difficult, but she had the courage to speak out. I am advised that an online petition has already attracted 100,000 signatures. Joshua Townsend, a student from St Edward's Catholic College in

        , also spoke out last night. He made a strong point that we just cannot turn away from this issue because it is too hard. Teenagers like Josie and Joshua too often may feel that they do not have a voice. But yesterday they joined 300 other people to make a stand on this issue because they know that in doing so they represent the voices of many others, and they too are getting up to make a stand against domestic violence.

        When yesterday's marchers reached Gosford Sailing Club, a ceremony was held to commemorate the victims who have died at the hands of their partner across Australia in 2015. Superintendent Danny Sullivan told me that there was a candle lit for every one of the 45 reported victims this year. These candles were to give a voice to the now voiceless women. Yesterday the candles lit up the dusk at Gosford on winter solstice, the darkest day of the year. This is surely a symbol that there is hope that we can change and that every day can be brighter from this point. It is not easy. Superintendent Sullivan also said to me that, on average, every two hours police will have to attend a domestic violence incident in

        I am pleased to say that the coalition government has made this issue a national priority. The
