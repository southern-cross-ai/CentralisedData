        On 12 June I was absolutely delighted to be part of the coalition government's announcement about providing $4 million to Very Special Kids, to enable them to pursue the purchase of their purpose-built palliative care facility in Malvern, within my electorate of Higgins. Very Special Kids is Australia's oldest and largest children's hospice. They provide a range of services for children with life-threatening conditions. Their services range from family counselling to, in the saddest of circumstances, end-of-life care. Every year, they help 900 Victorian families, not just in their eight-bed hospice in Malvern but also through their family support services provided in Malvern and their seven regional offices in Ballarat, Brunswick, Hastings, Shepparton, Torquay, Traralgon and Warrnambool.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since first becoming the member for Higgins, VSK has inspired me as it is one of the most extraordinarily self-reliant and resourceful services, filled with great compassion. Each and every year, Very Special Kids raises 70 per cent of the funds required to provide their services through the community. Last year, this was in the order of $5 million. The $4 million from this coalition government will go a long way to securing Very Special Kids in their Malvern site, providing the continued high visibility needed for this extraordinary charity. It will also enable Very Special Kids to remain connected with their donors and 400 committed volunteers. In addition, the Malvern site has great transport connections to greater Melbourne and country Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        This wonderful organisation has a longstanding lease with the state government which is expiring this year. The $4 million that this coalition government has provided will support VSK in their bid to purchase the site outright from the state government. Relocation is not an option for VSK. It would risk the philanthropic, volunteer and community support that it has fostered over more than 21 years, which is in essence the secret to its success. I implore the state government to come to the table with a discounted sale. An outright purchase will save VSK $300,000 in annual rent and secure its future for the benefit of Victorian families.

        I am lucky and proud to represent Higgins, home to a number of vibrant and modern community centres that traditionally have been shopping strips but in recent times have evolved to increasingly be focal points of restaurants and night-life. That is why at the last election I promised the people of Higgins that I would secure $100,000 in funding for two of these centres, both along Koornang Road in Carnegie, as well as along
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Street" rel="nofollow">

        in

        , Prahran and Windsor.
       </p>
       <p>
        This month I attended a Carnegie Traders Association breakfast where I was able to inform the traders of the good news that the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Michael Keenan MP, had agreed to provide $100,000 directly to their association. The traders association will be able to use the grant under round 1 of the Safer Streets Program. This will help to enhance the street lighting and install

        </a>
        cameras along Koornang Road. They are important tools in helping to deter criminal activity and antisocial behaviour and improve the safety for those shopping, dining, working or living in Carnegie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the last election, the Glen Eira City Council refused the offer of $100,000 to upgrade public safety. It is therefore very satisfying to now be able to say to the people of Carnegie that the safety upgrade will now go ahead because the money is going directly to the traders. I thank Graeme Callen, chairman of the Carnegie Traders Association, and his members for their hard work in pursuing this matter. Following the signing of the funding agreement with the Attorney General's Department, the association hopes the new system will be installed over the next few months.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also pleased that I have been able to deliver on my election commitment to the residents of Prahran, South Yarra and Windsor. Mr Keenan confirmed a grant of $100,000 to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Stonnington" rel="nofollow">
         City of Stonnington
        </a>
        to enhance their CCTV cameras along Chapel Street. This will see CCTV installed around Prahran town hall, at the South Yarra station, on the corner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Punt Road

        and Toorak Road, the corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street and the corner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Commercial Road
        </a>
        and Grattan Street. The installation of these CCTVs and improved street lighting will go a long way to making the suburbs of Higgins safer and more enjoyable for all to experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is wonderful to be able to represent the diverse and vibrant community of Higgins, where, in this place, the government is able to focus on their needs. I also look forward to being able to come into this place to make further announcements regarding, in particular, the infrastructure needs of my electorate and the challenges that face my electorate in this regard. It is important not only for our society in Higgins to be able to function even better but it is also important for our economic prosperity.
