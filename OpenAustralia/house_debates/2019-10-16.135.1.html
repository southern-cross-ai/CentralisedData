        The month of October marks the official new season for boating on the shores of the great

         Royal Brighton Yacht Club
        </a>
        , the 2019-20 sailing season is open and ready to rumble. This year's opening ceremony theme was country and western. For the first time, they were joined by the Brighton Icebergers for a relay race. I'd like to acknowledge the committee members of Brighton for their enduring public service: Commodore Paul Pascoe; Vice Commodore Peter Strain; Rear Commodore Peter Coleman; Honorary Treasurer Peter Demura; Club Captain Brett Heath; and general committee members Cath Hurley, Jim Leckey, Marnie Irving, Niesje Hees and

       <p>
        Last Saturday, Beaumaris Motor Yacht Squadron held the annual Sail Past Ceremony, a milestone event this year with the club celebrating its 60th anniversary. Graeme Disney, as always, was on hand to bless the fleet, followed by live music and entertainment. I'd like to give my best wishes to the Beaumaris office bearers: Commodore David Bell; Vice Commodore Les Sabo; Rear Commodore Michael Busuttil; Finance Director Hein Preller; Fishing Director Brendan Hocking; Site Director Shane Benedict; Club Secretary Simon Bartaby; Social Director John Giuliano; Immediate Past Commodore Ross Popplewell; and the hard-working staff, Club Manager Anthony Heyde and Club Caterer Armin Pfister.

       <p>
        We're only just coming up to the start of the sailing season for some other clubs. In particular, on Sunday 27th, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rock_Yacht_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Black Rock Yacht Club
        </a>
        will be celebrating their 100th anniversary at this year's opening ceremony. Guests will be treated to some full-bodied blues from 6 pm courtesy of The Brewers. I'd like to pass on best wishes to the committee for the season: Commodore Lara Blasse; Vice Commodore John Sammons; Rear Commodores Mark Jackson and Nik Wallis; Immediate Past Commodore Gary Lokum; Secretary Annabel Russell; Treasurer Gary McLennan; Sailing Captain Andre Blasse; and general committee members Mike Flavell,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Long" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Graeme Ainley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, all of these critical yacht clubs are an important part of the Goldstein community as is the Sandringham Yacht Club. At their opening day, the club's 10th anniversary celebrations continued, with the Andy Healey Trio providing entertainment. Awards for the best-dressed boats went to

       </p>
       <p>
        Each one of these clubs plays a critical role in the Goldstein community as part of the social fabric that takes advantage of our greatest natural asset, Port Phillip, and we wish them well for the 2019-20 sailing season.
