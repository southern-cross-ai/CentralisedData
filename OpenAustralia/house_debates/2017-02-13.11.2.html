         The Order
        </a>
        of Australia was inaugurated in 1975 to recognise Australians who demonstrate outstanding achievement or service. In the past 42 years more than 30,000 people have been received into the order. Today I would like to congratulate the recipients from my electorate who were recognised in this year's Australia Day honours list. From service in education, medicine and music to the welfare of patrons and the wider community, the recipients reflect the ability and diversity of our Berowra community. This service is an inspiration to others. Almost nothing is more valuable than a good education. The minds of the next generation of thinkers, entrepreneurs and leaders are being shaped today by some of the most dedicated members of our community.

        Unfortunately, many Australian women will experience breast cancer in their lifetime. In 1989 the Australian mastectomy rate for breast cancer sufferers was 70 to 80 per cent. Professor John Boyages AM of Cheltenham reduced this rate through breast screening by setting up the Sunflower breast screening clinics in lingerie departments at Myer stores and in hospitals across Sydney and founded BreastScreen

Just last week I had a constituent call my office to express how much of a positive impact Dr Chow had had on the treatment of her pain. Dr Chow is the foundation president of the Australian Medical Laser Association.

        Philip Glendenning AM of Brooklyn, Stewart Bonett OAM of Glenorie, Lynnette Molan OAM of Cherrybrook the Rev. Dr Roger Chilton OAM of Hornsby have each been recognised.

        I have had the pleasure of meeting many members of the Rural Fire Service in Berowra, particularly over this hot summer. For over 45 years James Fahey has served the communities of Hornsby, Ku-ring-gai and New South Wales with dedication and distinction. He has held many positions throughout the Rural Fire Service including, for the past 26 years, being a district group captain. Mr Fahey's service and leadership have undoubtedly saved many homes and lives. He was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many more members of the Berowra electorate deserving recognition for the incredible work they do every day. We should do more to acknowledge our unsung heroes. I encourage anyone who knows an Australian who is doing something special to serve our community to nominate them for recognition within the Order of Australia.

         honour roll this year. As has been noted in the motion, the Order of Australia is the highest national honour awarded to Australian citizens for exceptional service and achievement. As illustrated by this year's honours list, we have a nation full of men and women who are doing extraordinary things in their own communities and beyond. They are making a difference to the lives of many and building our country to be a bigger and better place which is more inclusive, more open, more knowledgeable and fairer and kinder for everyone. Looking through the list, we have incredible leaders who have contributed so much to our country and way of life, like former Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Medal of the Order of Australia
         </a>
         for their remarkable contributions to our community: Jim Tiberi from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont_Meadows" rel="nofollow">
          Claremont Meadows
         </a>
         and Paul Crofts from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Gardens" rel="nofollow">
          Cambridge Gardens
         </a>
         . Mr Tiberi, who moved to Australia at the age of eight, has contributed a great deal to the Italian-Australian community in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         . He was the founder and president of the Penrith Italian Seniors Association, and he broadcasts the Italian program on Wow
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
          FM
         </a>
         each week, bringing beautiful Italian music and culture to the ears of our community. Before his retirement, Mr Tiberi was a civil engineer and worked on a number of large projects in Sydney, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Tunnel" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Harbour Tunnel
         </a>

          Lane Cove Tunnel
         </a>
         . He also helped to build bridges, highways and power stations across the country and overseas. He had an incredible working life, and in retirement he spends much of his time working with the University of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age" rel="nofollow">
          Third Age
         </a>
         in Penrith, tutoring other seniors in Italian language and computer studies and sharing his skills of bonsai growing. Mr Tiberi has been a committee member of the Penrith Valley Seniors Computing Club, and was vice-president of Wow FM. This recognition is well deserved and his service to our community is to be congratulated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Paul Crofts of Cambridge Gardens is a Vietnam veteran who has given nearly three decades of his life to assist other veterans in their unique needs. Mr Crofts was a rifleman in the Vietnam war, serving as part of the 2nd Battalion of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Regiment
         </a>
         after being conscripted at the age of 20. He spent 314 days in the jungles of Vietnam defending our country, like so many others. Mr Crofts has been remember of the Returned and Services League Penrith sub-branch since 1991. For a large part of that time he was the welfare and pensions officer responsible for arranging funerals of veterans, reflecting on their lives and supporting their families to navigate the difficult realities of losing their loved one. Mr Crofts received the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to veterans and their families. I thank congratulate him for the work he has done in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, reflecting on the incredible men and women in my community who have been recognised with Australia Day awards, I am reminded of how many do their important work day in, day out, year in year out, without fanfare. It reminds me of all the community-minded people in my electorate of Lindsay who are serving in their own way, making our community a better place, creating opportunities for the vulnerable, welcoming and comforting those who need it and building a social network that encourages and supports people. We in Lindsay are lucky to have so many great people who give of their time generously and their energy boundlessly to help others. So this year we thank and congratulate Jim Tiberi and Paul Crofts for their well-deserved honour in being awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Their service to our community is an inspiration and we are indebted to their efforts over so many years. May they continue to make an impact for many years to come.

          of Australia awards: let us pause for a moment to reflect on some of the people who make our country so great. No doubt most of the 30,000 people who have received the awards since 1975 would have performed their community endeavours without seeking this recognition or any celebration of their efforts. But when the times seem so focused on the challenges and the many issues that confront us around the world, it is important that the rest of Australia know of their extraordinary work. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some examples, some of the recipients who live and work in Brisbane.

          of Technology Professor Raymond Leslie Frost was made an
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Officer of the Order of Australia
          </a>
          for distinguished service to science and higher education, particularly in the field of vibrational spectroscopy. Professor Frost has also been recognised for mentoring young scientists in the field. For those like me who had no clue what vibrational spectroscopy is, I looked it up: it describes some techniques for analysing molecular composition. As best as I can understand it, Professor Frost shoots strong lasers at things and by measuring the results, he derives clues as to the compounds and the molecules contained in those things—which actually is an incredibly promising field of research when you start reading about it—and Professor Frost's contribution to this important field is very significant.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another to be awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia was Professor

Professor Peter Gray is an Australian pioneer of biotechnology research and development. In 2003, he became the director of the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, and has since overseen the institute going from strength to strength. Professor Gray has been a leading figure in the development of antibodies. He has helped to manufacture an antibody, for instance, against Hendra virus—which I am sorry to say is, unfortunately, named after an otherwise beautiful suburb in Brisbane.

          Mr Alan Pidgeon, someone I have known for very many years, has been made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to the community. Amongst many other community organisations and contributions, Mr Pidgeon chairs the Australian Flag Association, which is a voluntary community organisation formed to increase appreciation of the history and the significance of a chief national symbol, the Australian flag. Good on you, Pidg.

           I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise a group of people in my electorate who were on standby on the weekend, during the catastrophic bushfire threat: those people are our incredibly dedicated and courageous firefighters. Miraculously, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Region" rel="nofollow">

           was spared , but other parts of the country were not so lucky. My family was driving home from Orange in the firestorm yesterday, and said it looked like nothing they had ever seen. My thoughts and prayers are with those communities who are in harm's way at the moment. Although we were lucky back home this weekend, that was not the case in January, when local firefighters battled three infernos in two weeks very near my home town of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurri_Kurri" rel="nofollow">
            Kurri Kurri
           </a>
           and, incredibly, managed to protect all but a few outbuildings. Hundreds of Rural Fire Service volunteers,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
            NSW
           </a>
           Fire and Rescue crews, and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks" rel="nofollow">
            National Parks
           </a>
           and Wildlife teams battled blazes, on days when the mercury soared well above 40 and hot winds fanned the flames. My mother and sister were evacuated from their homes in Kurri Kurri to safer ground—my place at Buchanan was their refuge until the danger passed. This was too close for comfort for our community, especially when we learned that these fires, in all likelihood, had been deliberately lit.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to personally thank the hardworking and dedicated fire crews and other emergency service personnel who fought those fires, on the ground and from the air, to keep us safe on those fierce, fiery days. That gratitude extends to all of the emergency service personnel who are at raging firefronts as we speak—it is just incredible. I know our community is immensely grateful to you. The weather has been incredibly hot, with records broken—it was 47.8 degrees in some parts of the valley over the weekend. I went to Orange, it was 40 degrees there. I have never seen it so hot, even in a place like Orange—which is normally on the cooler side. But again, my thanks extend to those members of our community.

As the Member for Goldstein from 1990 to 2004, David consistently provided all of this and more for our community.

And more importantly, so that those values can live in the hearts and minds of Australians all across this country—because freedom is only ever one generation away from extinguishment. In his community service and at every point, David has made sure that he stands up for those values and works with people to advance the good cause of Liberalism.

             announced the Order of Australia 'for the purpose of according recognition to Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service.' In replacing the British honours system, the Order of Australia did two things. They ensured that honours would be based on decisions of Australians, not those of the British, and they ensured that they would be made by

            <p>
             As we recognised these great Australian achievers, it is also always important that we have in mind those that we might have forgotten. I note that, while the recipient rate for women this
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
              Australia Day
             </a>
             rose to 34.7 per cent, up from 30.3 per cent in 2016, and the female nomination rate increased from 31.3 per cent to 32.9 per cent, women are still underrepresented by a significant degree in Australian honours. As honourable members will note from the fact that the nomination rate is lower than the recipient rate, once a woman is nominated, she has a better chance of receiving an award than does a man. So the problem lies, to a large extent, in the nomination process.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know Government House is well aware of this issue, but it can be too challenging for many people to nominate someone for an honour. They may not have the requisite papers in front of them. They may simply not have the time to devote to it. Professional organisations have become expert in ensuring that their past serving members are recognised. But those who toil in a soup kitchen for three decades may not be so lucky. We need to do more to recognise traditionally feminised work, done by the quiet achievers and the community organisations as well as the traditionally male work, such as leading large organisations. We also need to do more to track recipient rates among the overseas born, people with disabilities and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
              Indigenous Australians
             </a>
             , because we have to stay true to that great Whitlam legacy of 1975; that of ensuring that our Australian honours system is uniquely ours and uniquely representative and ensures that it recognises everyone who is worthy of such an honour.

              It is not often that we get a chance to put on parliamentary record the outstanding efforts of great individuals in our community. Today I have that opportunity to showcase five amazing individuals. Firstly, Robyn Florance, who lives in Bomaderry, and is a dedicated and focussed local historian. She has now been awarded the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
               OAM
              </a>
              for her service to community history and heritage preservation. Robyn is a well-known local history writer and committee member of the Shoalhaven Historical Society and Nowra Museum from 1987 to 2015, serving as president from 1996 to 2005.
             </p>
             <p>
              Her work for the Shoalhaven City Council Heritage Study between 1995 and 1998 and the Kiama Municipal Council, Kiama Heritage Study Review in 2000 reflect her love and dedication to history. Robyn also coordinated the Centenary Commemoration of Gallipoli and the 2015-2016 Waratah March, which in this simple one line does not do justice to the inspiring work she did to help the re-enactment come into being with local interest and shops fronts decorated and all joining into the taste of history on the day.
             </p>
             <p>
              Raymond Vincent, a gentle and generous Coolangatta resident and local volunteer, was awarded the OAM for his service to the community with a multitude of organisations, including Berry Apex and the Shellharbour tennis club. Raymond was the fundraising coordinator for the construction of the Shoalhaven Heads Apex Cottage for Kids, SH

              K, Foundation, which is a respite accommodation space for families of chronically ill or disabled children. Raymond is currently the chairperson and has been since 1991. Ray has been able to volunteer his building services in a number of other community projects, often in a quiet and unannounced manner.

              Then we have the dynamic duo, Bruce and

               Barbara Smith
              </a>
              , a husband and wife team from Moruya, both gaining an OAM for their service to the community in the Eurobodalla region. They volunteer in many organisations, including the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
               Country Women's Association

              and St Vincent De Paul in Moruya. Barbara is a volunteer teacher at Braidwood Central School as well as a tuckshop volunteer at Moruya Public School and

              Rural Fire Service—and hopefully she does not have to come into action in these times—including being captain of the Catering Brigade and Call-Out Officer for the Moruya Brigade. Barbara's volunteering includes the Moruya Show Society and day care at Moruya Hospital.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bruce is an active member of the

              </a>
              , and has been since 1996. He has been captain until 2015. His other volunteering includes the Mogo Hot Fire Training Centre and as a new trainee mentor and driver with the vintage Blitz 1942 fire truck. He has been a member since 1961 and has also volunteered with the

               John Bennett
              </a>
              , now also the recipient of an OAM, has been a dedicated and generous worker in the community, especially the Nowra Show Society. However, John has taken his skills and dedication well beyond the local area, taking his energy to the Royal Agricultural Show in Sydney where he has been a popular and well-respected ring master, but he has also taken young agriculturalists to developing nations to help show them basic agronomy skills, how to care for animals in a different way, talk about the way they get their crops growing and generally assist in the increased levels of productivity in regional areas in these nations. Now John is harnessing the energy of others when addressing issues that he encounters at such places as the Commonwealth Agricultural Conference in Singapore in October, where the coming famine and global food security as the planet heads towards 10 billion people in 2050 is seen as a very, very big issue.

              Finally,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Gash" rel="nofollow">
               Joanna Gash
              </a>
              has been awarded an AM for her service to the Shoalhaven. On the website her list of achievements is impressive and includes federal member for Gilmore from 1996 to 2013. She is my predecessor and current mentor. These listings—shadow parliamentary secretary for tourism, government whip, member, Speaker's panel, Mayor of the City of Shoalhaven, councillor since 2012 and previous councillor on the

              —do not truly reflect the extent of her service to her community. In her early days as a tourism officer in the Wingecarribee, she develop training modules and connections for New South Wales tourism that still exist today. Joanna has been a part of serving the community since the 1980s and continues still. One incident that comes to mind is that, as a volunteer, she used to drive a busload of kidney dialysis patients to Wollongong for their treatment and helped agitate and advocate for local services to be delivered in the local hospital. She has been the advocate in the parliament to keep

               Award recipients already mentioned by previous members of this place and acknowledge their tremendous and tireless work throughout communities all over the country. A bit closer to home, in my electorate in the federal seat of Perth, I am pleased to say there were six winners of Order of Australia honours: one member in the General Division of the Order of Australia and five medals of the Order of Australia in the General Division. I will briefly set them out.
              </p>
              <p>
               Firstly, Christopher Pye of

                Mount Lawley

               of Inglewood was acknowledged for his service to military history and to veterans and their families. Vaughan Harding of Inglewood received a medal for services to aged-care organisations. And last, but certainly not least, Colin Philippson of Embleton was acknowledged for service to the community and also to motor racing.

               Time sadly does not permit me to speak at length about all of these recipients, but I have written to them all to convey my congratulations to them personally. But the following examples are demonstrative of the sheer quantum of actual service rendered, which is belied by the too-brief citation. Take Mr Christopher Pye, for example.

               Ms Jennifer Davis was quite rightly given an award for services to performing arts, but this citation does not do justice to what she is achieving in the community through theatre. Her 30-year career working in the industry has focused on youth and seniors' theatre, bringing generations together to tell

                  I am extremely proud to stand here today to formally congratulate four of my constituents, who are recipients of the 2017
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
                   Australia Day
                  </a>
                  honours, plus one young man who was born and raised in Grey but has made a national headline since moving away. I also congratulate a community leader who has been a great contributor to the Indigenous community.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On Australia Day each year, we as a nation officially honour those who have made a significant contribution to our community. It is the Aussie way of saying, 'Thank you.' We recognise people for what they are doing and tell them we appreciate it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In Australia's regional communities, people who are awarded Australia Day honours are very often cornerstones of rural life who have been recognised for their tireless work and dedication. Our honours system recognises Australians from all walks of life who have made a difference to their nation, their region and their community. From contributions to community, business and the arts, to health, research and sport, each and every person who received an award this year deserves our utmost gratitude and respect. I congratulate all the winners, particularly those from Grey, each striving to make their regional communities a better place to live.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In particular, I congratulate Sheryl Lewis, of Yunta, who was awarded an Ambulance Service Medal,
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM" rel="nofollow">
                   ASM
                  </a>
                  for her dedication and volunteer service in her community. She has been an ambulance volunteer in the mid-north region of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                   South Australia
                  </a>
                  since 1991, initially in Yunta then Jamestown and then back to Yunta, where she is currently a volunteer team leader. She provides a crucial service in what is a resource-poor environment. Her dedication, leadership and commitment has a significant impact on the region. In a tiny place like Yunta, the ambulance drivers are the front line. The ambulance drivers are the medical service, for all intents and purposes. She assists in the setting up and running of the flying doctor clinics in Yunta, and follows up local patients with routine checks and health monitoring.

Over 46 years, Duncan has been with the St John Ambulance Service and the South Australia Ambulance Service, first as a cadet, before starting his professional career in 1985. During those years, he moved into the leadership positions of station officer and clinical team leader. Duncan is an invaluable member of the Port Augusta ambulance service.

                  Jan Ferguson, an Outback Communities Authority board member, who resides part time in Beltana, received a Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to the Indigenous communities of the Northern Territory.

                 <p>
                  Lastly, I come to a young man who has leapt to international prominence quite recently. Swimming sensation Kyle Chalmers was born and raised in
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
                   Port Lincoln
                  </a>
                  , but has since moved to Adelaide to follow his sport. He was recognised with an
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
                   Order of Australia Medal
                  </a>
                  for his services to sport. Kyle became a household name at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, where he won the gold medal in the premier event, the 100-metre freestyle, the first Australian to do so since
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wenden" rel="nofollow">
                   Michael Wenden
                  </a>
                  in 1968. Well done to Kyle.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I met Kyle just recently, along with his parents, whom I have known for a long time. I will say of Kyle: if he swum like a stone and sank like a brick, he would still be a son that any parent would be extremely proud of. He is extremely humble, well-spoken and well-considered. He would be a success no matter what he was doing. In this particular case, Kyle is the No. 1 swimmer in the world in the premier event. Well done to all his coaches and his schools, and, particularly, well done to his parents for raising such a well-rounded young man.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Well done to all of those people for being recognised with the prestigious honour of Australia Day awards. I also commend all the volunteers in my electorate, who work hard to make their communities a better place. Without these volunteers regional communities would be poorer places, and I am proud of every one of them.

                   Professor Johnston was recognised for his distinguished service to engineering as an academic, researcher, practitioner and consultant, particularly in the fields of structural foundation engineering and geothermal energy. Professor Vaux has provided dedicated service to medicine in the field of biomedical cancer research, to higher education as an academic and mentor, and to professional integrity and ethics. Mr Roland Elias Jabbour has provided significant contributions to Australian industry and, indeed, more broadly to Australian-Arab relations.

In a highly diverse, multicultural electorate, such as my electorate of Batman, it is people like Rossella, committed to helping and welcoming migrants, that make it the best place to live. Young Citizen of the Year was Lucy Grage-Perry, for her work with Parkside Netball Club, while Millbrooke Calisthenics Club was named community club of the year. Congratulation to the recipients of the Order of Australia and the Darebin Australia Day awards. Thank you.

                    Compassion, dedication, courage, kindness, civility and service: these are the words that I believe describe the values of recipients of honours under the Order of Australia awarded recently to so many people. They are the true Australian values that have made our nation the best in the world and fostered our great culture of mateship and volunteerism.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Today I congratulate all those who were awarded honours in the Order of Australia, our nation's most prestigious means of recognising capable and selfless citizens. In particular I would like to congratulate those honours recipients who I represent in Boothby. The motion today notes the array of fields that honours recipients may have contributed to, and I think it speaks to the calibre of my community that we cover the majority of those fields, with service in science, education, sport and community service.

                    In the fields of science and education, I congratulate Emeritus Professor John Bowie AM for his significant contribution to our understanding of mass spectrometry and for passing that knowledge on to others. Professor Bowie was made a member of the Order of Australia for this service. Professor Bowie has held many positions at the

                    Mr Ian Steel OAM received his award for service to children through social welfare programs.

                    I would also like to recognise Dr Jennifer Gardner OAM who has made a wonderful contribution to Urrbrae House and the Waite Arboretum since 1986. Her award was for service to conservation and the environment and, by chance, I ran into one of her dedicated volunteers during my listening post at the Mitcham shopping centre on Saturday morning, who told me that Dr Gardner is actually retiring this year from Adelaide university after so many years of dedicated service. She has been the curator of the Waite Arboretum since 1986 and the manager of Urrbrae house and gardens, and she founded the Friends of the Waite Conservation Reserve and also the Friends of the Waite Arboretum—truly a wonderful contribution. I wish her all the very best in her retirement.

I think it is worth commenting on some of the things the association does. Firstly, I thank them for their support to take this story of the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin to the nation here in Parliament House on Thursday. I also want to acknowledge our grassroots work where we take kids from disadvantaged schools out and give them an experience in the bush over a weekend. They are great events. We also mentor some of the scholarship winners so that they can have a life-changing study experience at the

                     I again want to congratulate not only all those who were awarded in this last round but also all those people in the community who have not been given an award in the Order of Australia but who day in, day out are giving of their time, their heart, their spirit and their generosity. I encourage people: if you see someone in the community that is doing outstanding work, giving of themselves in an amazing way, please nominate them for an award in the Order of Australia. Well done again to all those Territorians; we are proud of you.

                      I rise this morning to congratulate two people in my community who, through their extraordinary efforts, were recognised and awarded an Order of Australia. Both of these gentlemen were refugees to this country.

                     <p>
                      I would like to begin by speaking about a good friend of mine, Mr Vincent Kong,

                      . Vincent is a very humble man and a most deserving person. He came to Australia with nothing, but today he is the managing director of one of the largest Asian grocery providers in Australia. In the early 1980s, Vincent and his family set out on a vessel from a small fishing village in war-torn Vietnam fleeing oppression. They battled extreme weather conditions and outran pirates, eventually arriving in Australia, where they were granted asylum. Vincent has never forgotten the kindness that he and his family received from Australia and was determined to give back to this community.

He has been responsible for substantial fundraising efforts, including the raising of many, many thousands of dollars for Australians in need. He has used his own resources to help acquire property for various community organisations. Vincent is also involved in fundraising activities for schools, donating significant amounts of food and produce each year.

                      That brings me to another friend, Dr Vinh Binh Lieu, OAM, who was recently recognised for his exceptional commitment to the provision of health care services to both the Vietnamese and the broader Australian community. Dr Lieu, together with his wife and a daughter, fled Vietnam in early 1979. In a small fishing vessel, with over 300 people on board, he and his family spent two weeks at sea, risking the elements and outrunning pirates, with very little food and water on board. Eventually making it to Thailand, they were processed by the

                      and then, later that year, settled in Australia with nothing except a dream for freedom.

Dr Lieu is also the founder and editor of a national bilingual Vietnamese-English medical magazine providing the community with valuable information about issues affecting Australian health care, clinical research and general good health and wellbeing. He also established the Vietnamese-

Dr Lieu has worked tirelessly to organise a large number of health conferences in our local community, such as a lung cancer seminar for the Cancer Institute

                      . Dr Lieu is also passionate about raising funds for communities in need. One example of this is a charity dinner that he organised in January 2011 as part of the Queensland Premier's Flood Relief Appeal, where his efforts raised $120,000.

                      There is so much more I would like to say about Mr Kong and Dr Lieu, with their immense contributions to our community, demonstrating the true value of Australia's multiculturalism. I conclude by acknowledging the many individuals that have come to Australia as refugees, contributing much to our nation. I congratulate the broad range of award recipients who were honoured and who continue to excel and serve our community and our nation with a wide range of skills. It is such examples which make me extremely proud to be working within such a strong, diverse and vibrant community.
