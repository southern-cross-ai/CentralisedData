       <p>
        This week is National Carers Week. I would like to relay a story about a wonderful woman who never knew she was going to become a carer. Her son, Luke Stojanovic, was a great motocross motorcyclist. He had an accident and came down on his head. He ended up with massive brain trauma. His mother sat by his bedside while he was in a coma and waited for him to come out of that coma. He then started to learn to sit up. He had to learn to talk again—that is not there yet. He had to learn to eat again. She has been his constant carer for the remaining time, right up to now. I saw them last week, when I went to say to Luke that he had to make sure he had actually shaved himself. He has now learnt to stand on his own two feet, with help, but he has done that. They learnt to sign, with one hand, so that he can actually communicate. His mother has been a constant carer during this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luke set himself a goal—he raised more than $77,000 for the Liverpool Hospital Brain and Trauma Unit. He rode a recumbent tricycle for 180 kilometres. He has set himself a goal and I will do everything I can to assist his family. He wants to try to get a medal in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Special Olympics
        </a>
        . At the moment there is no such event, but Lukey, rock on, we are with you and we are going to try to make it work for you. He is an amazing young man and his mother, Kim Stojanovic, is a champion amongst parents.
