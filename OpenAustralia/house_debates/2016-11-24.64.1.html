         The member for McMahon will not interject. I have ruled the question out of order on the basis that it does not go to the Prime Minister's responsibilities at all. We have covered this ground before. I can waste question time if you want. I think it is better if we just play on.

          My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on how the government's ambitious agenda of export trade deals is creating jobs for hardworking Australians, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

          <p>
           I thank the member for Goldstein for his question, because he, like all members of the coalition, is a key part of this government's strong focus on making sure that we are driving opportunities for Australians to be employed, particularly through our strong agenda in relation to boosting exports. It took a coalition government and my predecessor, the member for Goldstein, to put in place three free trade agreements—with Japan, with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
            South Korea
           </a>
           and, of course, with China—that have underpinned the strong economic growth that we have had which, in turn, is resulting in strong employment growth for Australians. In fact, it is part of the reason why, as a country, we have had 25 years of continuous economic growth. Indeed, Gaia Skin Naturals, in the member's home state of Victoria, has seen a 36 per cent increase in their exports into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asian" rel="nofollow">
            North Asian
           </a>
           marketplaces as a direct result of the coalition's historic trifecta of free trade agreements that we put in place. In fact, Gaia general manager, Simon Vogrinec, says Gaia is experiencing double-digit growth and it has enabled the company 'to grow and their supply chain to grow, creating jobs in their local area'.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the member for Goldstein asks about alternative approaches and is there, in fact, any risks to creating employment pathways for Australians. And I am sorry to say to the member for Goldstein that there are some risks, because what we see is that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           , under this Leader of the Opposition, are more interested in playing political games than they are in delivering for Australian workers. The Leader of the Opposition, we know, likes to strut around the place saying he is all about putting Australian workers first. We have heard that many times, right? But, unfortunately, despite the rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition that he is about Australian workers first, when he comes into this chamber and when the Labor Party comes into this chamber, what do they do? They vote to make sure that foreign workers have a tax advantage compared to Australian workers. What do they do on their costings? The shadow Treasurer actually incorporates costings pre the election of 32½ per cent for backpackers—32½ per cent incorporated as your costings before the election—but then, when it comes to the actual vote, you would rather play political games and instead try to give a big tax cut to foreign workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The simple fact is this: the tax cut that the Australian Labor Party wants to deliver to working holiday-makers will be funded off the back of tax increases for small business, funded off the back of tax increases for superannuation holders and funded off the back of making Australian workers less competitive than foreign workers. You say one thing in here and a different thing out on the street.
