        I rise tonight to congratulate all those people who were involved in helping Landsborough, a town, a community in my electorate, celebrate their 150th birthday on the weekend. In particular, I would like to mention the efforts of the local community committee, which was set up over 12 months ago to make sure that the weekend was such a success: the president, Councillor Robert Vance; the secretary, Shirley Smyth; and the committee members Kevin Free, Beth Hodgetts, Jan Vance, Dianne Western, Tim Western, Mary Devitt, Elizabeth Amarant, Amanda Western and Robert Durbridge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Landsborough put on a terrific show on the weekend. And there are a couple of inspiring things that I would like to mention. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the coordinator, Virginia—commonly known as 'Becky'—Holbrook. For the last 12 months has been battling cancer, and yet she was determined to not let it beat her and to be there to help organise the festivities on the weekend. It was absolutely inspiring to see her there. She has been dealing with chemo, but she was determined to be there and to make sure that the event went successfully—and full credit to her for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley Smyth, the secretary of the celebrations committee, lost her husband of 46 years two weeks ago—and yet she was there, making sure that the celebrations went well. She said to me that, in a way, she was glad it was happening, because it was helping her deal with the loss of her soul mate for all that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        And what a show they put on. There was the unveiling of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Landsborough" rel="nofollow">
         William Landsborough
        </a>
        statue, which is now in the main street in the town. As soon as you turn the corner into the main street of the town, it is there for all to see. There is a memorial wall, which commemorates all the families of the past who have made a contribution to Landsborough.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Historical Society put on quite a show. They had historical memorabilia set out for all to see in the old Barkly school hall, which probably dates back 140 years itself. The school also put on its own show and its own celebration. A lot of the kids and families from the school were dressed in the period dress of 150 years ago. They really entered into the celebration. There was the raising of the Australian flag in the afternoon, followed by 150 balloons being let off by the schoolchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the football club, you could go down and see all the memorabilia of Landsborough's football premierships, as well as of the netball clubs. There was also information dating back for the tennis club and the bowls club. It was all extremely well put together, including videos of some of the old football games.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I would like to mention three people who made my trip to Landsborough, to join in the celebrations, so memorable. Shirley Smyth showed me around the school, welcomed me and told me all about what the committee had done and what they had put together. Diane Western took me around the Historical Society's records and showed me all the history of Landsborough that they had kept over those 150 years. And Graeme Sandlandt took me down to the football club rooms and took me through all the sporting memorabilia dating back over the years and showing quite clearly everything that Landsborough has achieved on the sporting field.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great community event. The community was out in force. It showed what country communities are all about: everyone doing their little bit to make sure that the town celebrated this major achievement in style. I was proud and privileged to be part of it, and I congratulate the Landsborough community for all they did in making that 150-year celebration such a wonderful weekend.
