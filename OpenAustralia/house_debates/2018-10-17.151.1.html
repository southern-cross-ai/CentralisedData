       <p>
        Today I want to take the opportunity to update the House on the government's efforts to improve Australia's waste management. The coalition has led the debate in 2018 to develop a solution to Australia's waste problem. It's something I'm very proud of. The Australian public are very motivated about reducing waste not only in my electorate of Durack but across the country. We all create waste in our day-to-day lives. Most of us put multiple bins out on the curb on Sunday night or Monday night—whenever it might be—and we want to know that our waste is being managed properly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians generate about 64 million tonnes of waste a year. I think you'd agree it's an extraordinary figure, Deputy Speaker Hogan. Sixty per cent of that waste is recycled, but a significant portion of that cannot be recycled due to contamination. That's a simple matter of Australians being confused about what goes where and what to do with their waste; it's those fleeting moments when we're standing at that bin deciding what goes where, and those few seconds are what count the most. Last month I launched the Australasian Recycling Label alongside the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation. It's a simple labelling system to guide Australians at that critical time. It will prevent the wrong waste contaminating our recycling system. More than 50 Australian businesses are already using the label, and I expect that number will grow significantly. It's a move by industry—and I want to congratulate industry—in response to the signals that are being sent by our government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year environment ministers from every state and territory agreed to set an ambitious target, and that is to make all Australian packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Our government is also in the process of updating Australia's National Waste Policy.

        Importantly, this government recognises the need to reduce the amount of waste that is generated in Australia whilst increasing our domestic recycling capabilities and demand for recyclable products. I'm particularly excited about our commitment to halve food waste by 2030. Ultimately, we've got to have a flexible approach to waste management and we simply have to do better.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think most Australians would be astounded to know that some communities in regional Australia don't have curb-side recycling collections. It's something I'm very aware of as a regional Australian. Not every community has access to the same facilities. Regional solutions will be a critical part of developing new businesses that use recycled material. Sensible management of waste will deliver better outcomes for Australia's environment, but there are other benefits here as well. A much stronger domestic industry means more local jobs. This is what our government believes in: keeping the economy strong and backing those Australian businesses.
