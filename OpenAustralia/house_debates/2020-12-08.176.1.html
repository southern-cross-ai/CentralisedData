       <p>
        In contributing to this grievance debate, I wish to draw the attention to the parliament to three priorities projects within the Moore electorate which would benefit from federal funding in conjunction with commitments from state and local governments. Unfortunately, the current coronavirus pandemic has delayed many local projects. However, we must work hard to get them back on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, the planned connection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfords_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Whitfords Avenue
        </a>
        with a realigned Gnangara Road has been delayed for several years, hampering local economic development and holding back the creation of jobs. The commitment of $2 million was made ahead of the 2017 state election; however, the design and construction of works are yet to commence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will improve access to employment and services in the Wangara industrial and commercial area for local commuters. This critical east-west route through the heartland of the Moore electorate will complement the recently completed traffic bridges, linking the Joondalup and Wanneroo communities at the intersections of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joondalup_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Joondalup Drive
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        . Local residents will be able to commute to work much more easily.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project contains two elements: firstly, the realignment of Gnangara Road to meet Whitfords Avenue; and, secondly, the construction of a roundabout on Wanneroo Road at the new intersection with both the aforementioned major roads. It is a project which requires joint cooperation of the City of Wanneroo and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Roads_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Main Roads Western Australia
        </a>
        . The project has bipartisan support from local, state and federal members of parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brett Raponi, Liberal for Landsdale, has been working hard to generate local support to advance this project with the Liberal state opposition, committing $10 million towards the project, if elected. Local landowners have plans to invest in the construction of new commercial buildings along the realigned Gnangara Road frontage with national tenants ready to establish stores, creating local jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the current economic climate we cannot afford to have this project delayed any longer. I call upon Main Roads Western Australia and the City of Wanneroo to cooperate more closely in delivering this infrastructure without further delay. There is significant merit in a federal funding contribution in the budget towards this critical piece of infrastructure.
       </p>

        Founded in 1958, the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club has a membership of 1,768 financial members, including a junior base of 640 Nippers. The current clubhouse facilities are close to 40 years old and require significant redevelopment in order to provide modern facilities for the lifesavers who patrol our popular beaches, keeping our communities safe. In order to meet the needs of the current and forecast membership base, support the development of junior and youth members, and provide necessary training and community services, a redevelopment concept plan has been proposed by the committee to increase the internal building floor area of the clubhouse, and storage and operational areas, including an external courtyard, deck and wash-down areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The surf club redevelopment has been in process for several years. However, it has been frustratingly slow to advance the design and secure funding. It will be desirable for the project to be expedited with key milestones and deadlines agreed upon to achieve timely delivery of the redevelopment in line with community expectations. It is essential for all three levels of government—local, state and federal—to work cooperatively together with the private sector to secure the necessary funding and corporate sponsorship to upgrade our local surf club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hodge Collard Preston Architects have been engaged by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        to prepare a concept design for the redevelopment and, as the local government authority, will take the lead role in project management. It is estimated that the renovations will cost approximately $8 million and, as patron of the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club, I'm actively working to bring all parties together to cooperatively support this essential and very worthy redevelopment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I strongly make the case for federal funding contributions in future budgets towards the development of the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club. Surf lifesaving is a community service which literally saves lives on our beaches. Our lifesavers are operating from cramped facilities which are close to 40 years old. A federal contribution towards the new clubhouse facilities in conjunction with local and state government support is warranted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several surf clubs in the eastern states, such as the North Cronulla Life Saving Club, received building grants of up to $2.9 million. Point Lonsdale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLSC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        received $650,000 while Long Reef surf club received $1.9 million, so the precedent for federal funding has been established.
       </p>
       <p>
        The redevelopment of the Heathridge Park precinct in my electorate is an exciting priority project which also requires funding from all three levels of government. The popular venue is used by thousands of local residents for sporting and community purposes. A number of local clubs utilise the grounds with ageing club room facilities, including the Ocean Ridge Junior and Amateur Football Clubs, the Ocean Ridge Junior and Senior Cricket Clubs and the Ocean Ridge Tennis Club. The current clubhouse buildings are more than 30 years old and inadequate to meet the needs of our growing population. Larger and more modern change rooms, toilets and club room and kitchen facilities are required in order to meet the needs of a growing number of junior and female participants in sport such as women's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2019, the City of Joondalup commenced a needs analysis and feasibility study for Heathridge Park. The study highlighted inadequacies with the ageing infrastructure and the outdated design, and the fragmented location of existing buildings causes operational issues. The study demonstrated that the redevelopment of Heathridge Park will assist with meeting the needs of existing and future users. A draft master plan has been prepared of the redevelopment for community consultation. The estimated construction costs associated with the redevelopment are approximately $15.7 million.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        of Joondalup, as the local government authority, will take a lead role in the project management. A federal funding contribution in the budget towards the redevelopment of Heathridge Park, in conjunction with local and state government funding, will benefit a number of sporting clubs which use the facilities, including the Ocean Ridge Junior and Amateur Football Clubs, the Ocean Ridge Junior and Senior Cricket Clubs and the Ocean Ridge Tennis Club. Strong community support has been registered through a petition, in cooperation with Sheldon Ingham, the Liberal candidate for Joondalup, who is also actively working to support the redevelopment. The current clubhouse buildings are more than 30 years old and inadequate to meet the needs of our growing population. The City of Joondalup has released a master plan of the redevelopment for public consultation and, as the local government authority, will take a lead role.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding my contribution to this grievance debate, I make a strong case in this parliament for a federal funding contribution towards these three priority projects in the Moore electorate—namely, the connection of Whitfords Avenue with the realigned Gnangara Road, the redevelopment of Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club and the redevelopment of Heathridge Park. These represent projects which are long overdue to meet the needs of our community.
