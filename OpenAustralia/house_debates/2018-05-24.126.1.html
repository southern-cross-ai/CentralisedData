        I rise to acknowledge an incredible volunteer in my community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , Colin Marchant. This month, Colin celebrated his 92nd birthday at a wonderful party, with a glass of bubbly, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gosford" rel="nofollow">
         East Gosford
        </a>
        . The party hosted by Deanna Bocking, and Colin was surrounded by family and friends. On his birthday, Colin popped into my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Gosford" rel="nofollow">
         West Gosford
        </a>
        office for a little celebration. We got chatting over a cup of tea, and I was reminded of the incredible contribution Colin has made to our community over decades as a volunteer. As we chatted, he told me about his early career in the opera and then in musical theatre as a young man, travelling around the country on tour. He told me about teaching ballroom dancing and later becoming a marketing executive. I hadn't heard these stories before because Colin is also so focused on helping others and on serving our community. Since 2012, Colin has been there for me, for my colleagues on the Central Coast and for the Liberal Party, over many decades. He's always there when you need him and, incredibly, at 92 years of age is always willing to lend a hand at our community functions and listening posts. I'd like to place on record my thanks and appreciation to Colin Marchant for his commitment to our community and to the Liberal Party.
       </p>
       <p>
        His story, though, is like that of so many other people on the Central Coast. His work as a volunteer is mirrored by nearly 23,000 residents in my electorate who volunteer their time to make our community a better place. In this National Volunteer Week I'd like to acknowledge all of the incredible volunteers in my community who make a profound impact in our region and in society. Our volunteers play a critical role in helping to shape Australia and helping to build stronger and more resilient communities in supporting individual participation in community life.
       </p>

        According to the latest census data, of the 23,000 volunteers in Robertson around 13,000 are female, over 350 are over the age of 85 and 1,800 are aged between 15 and 19, with the biggest group being those aged between 45 and 54. These are volunteers like Kylie Brown, who dedicates her time to the Southern and Ettalong United Football Club as well as Woy Woy Peninsula Little Athletics. Kylie was the driving force behind the community campaign for upgrades to McEvoy Oval in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umina_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a project that has now been delivered, thanks to funding from this government, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        and local sporting organisations. It includes the hundreds of volunteer surf lifesavers who keep our beaches safe every summer. I'm looking forward to thanking those volunteers at many of the upcoming presentation evenings. Colin's and Kylie's stories are snapshots of those of the thousands of people across the Central Coast who give so tirelessly and selflessly for the benefit of our community. To each and every person involved in a community organisation or in some way as a volunteer, we thank you for the work you do and we thank you for helping to make Central Coast the best region in the best country in the world.
