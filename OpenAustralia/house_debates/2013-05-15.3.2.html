       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's strong economy and Australia's social safety nets are the envy of the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this bill, we see Australia at its very best.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this bill, we see that we still can be the strong, smart, fair Australia that created the age pension and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        , Medibank, Medicare and universal superannuation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this bill, we see that there is still a place for collective action to solve those great pressures of life that are too big and complex for individuals and families to solve alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this bill, we see a nation united in a spirit of concern to strengthen and extend the fair go, to ensure no-one is left behind. We also see a parliament ready to put the national interest ahead of ideology.
       </p>
       <p>
        To those who say Australian politics no longer works, I say simply: read the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a united embrace of national responsibility and a great act of mutual care and solidarity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every week or fortnight, a sliver of the pay packet will go to DisabilityCare Australia: around a dollar a day for the average earner.
       </p>
       <p>
        But all that money added together from every corner of the nation will be a mighty force for good.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we give an assurance to all Australians who live with disability and to those who care for them: DisabilityCare Australia will be here when you need it—election after election, decade after decade, generation after generation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a new assurance for 410,000 Australians living with significant, permanent disability now and for their families and carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we also give a new assurance to all those Australians who do not have a disability today but who, through the vagaries of fortune, will come to have a significant, permanent disability in times to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        For everyone who thinks, 'It couldn't happen to me—could it?' this bill brings peace of mind, it brings the knowledge that a scheme as well designed and stably funded as Medicare will be here when you need it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me turn to the detail of the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will increase the Medicare levy by half a percentage point, from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, from 1 July 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also makes consequential changes to the upper phase-in amount for low-income taxpayers with income between certain thresholds—as well as to the formula for calculating the amount of a person's Medicare levy liability where a person has a spouse or dependants.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes reflect the increase in the Medicare levy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Low-income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low-income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current exemptions from the Medicare levy will also remain in place, including for blind pensioners and sickness allowance recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of other tax rates that include a component for the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change—these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and excess contributions tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bills will be introduced by my ministers today and further details of these consequential increases are set out in the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every cent raised by the increase in the Medicare levy will be allocated to a special fund over the next decade—the DisabilityCare Australia Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        By law, the fund will only be spent on supporting people with disability through DisabilityCare Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be established by the DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill 2013, which will be put before the House as part of this package.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of this fund will be outlined in the explanatory memorandum to that bill which is to be tabled by the Deputy Prime Minister shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Increasing the Medicare levy will raise approximately $20.4 billion between 2014-15 and 2018-19—amounting to approximately 55 per cent of the total cost of funding DisabilityCare Australia over that period.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commonwealth's share of the fund will go toward our additional contribution to DisabilityCare Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will cover around 60 per cent of the Australian government's new net spending on the scheme over the 10 years from 2014-15.
       </p>
       <p>
        In last night's budget, the Deputy Prime Minister outlined that through this increased levy and other wise savings, DisabilityCare Australia is fully funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        DisabilityCare Australia is designed to ensure every Australian with significant and permanent disability, regardless of where he or she lives, gets the care and support they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        DisabilityCare Australia will end the notorious 'postcode lottery' for people with disabilities in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want no more of the unfairness and irrationality by which a person gets vastly different support merely because of where he or she lives or how a disability was acquired.
       </p>
       <p>
        This requires the commitment and support of state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will assist the states and territories with funding their share of DisabilityCare Australia by setting aside some of the money going into the DisabilityCare Australia Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the life of the fund, the states and territories will be allocated a total of $9.7 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The states and territories will be able to draw down from the fund when they meet key conditions for implementation.
       </p>
       <p>
        DisabilityCare Australia will have full coverage across the

       </p>
       <p>
        We encourage the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        government to join the cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        All our people deserve the best.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that DisabilityCare Australia is fully funded, the government has implemented a number of other savings measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of the savings from reforms to the government's assistance for private health insurance announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO which have not been allocated to the government's dental package will support DisabilityCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding will also come from reforms to retirement incomes policy, the phase-out of the net medical expenses tax offset and other long-term savings decisions now announced as part of the 2013-14 budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Making a new call upon the finances of Australians is not something that is done without care in this country. The fact is when a levy does happen, there is a very good reason for it and rightly so:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        with the Medicare levy;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        with the levy for gun buy-backs; the government's flood levy which rebuilt Queensland; and, now, this increase in the Medicare levy to support DisabiltyCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ours has been a fiscally-responsible government—offsetting all new spending since 2009, holding expenditure at a level lower than the average seen over the past 25 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        A levy was not our first choice of funding vehicle for DisabilityCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, with the high dollar and the historic anomaly of nominal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        growth falling below real GDP growth for a sustained period, the revenue write-downs have been unprecedented: $17 billion for this financial year since the last budget update alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        In short, the facts have changed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also deeply conscious that the states and territories face their own fiscal pressures arising from these same complex economic circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        So we want to be able to offer them more support to pay for the scheme, which is why a substantial share of funds raised by this levy will go to the states and territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, we have listened to the sound case made by disability support groups for secure, ongoing funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a time of burden sharing and wise savings, they are right to want to ensure that DisabilityCare has a sustainable and stable funding stream, in order to guarantee the security DisabilityCare is designed to bring.
       </p>
       <p>
        The President of People with Disability Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Wallace" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Wallace
        </a>
        , has summarised the argument well. The levy will be, in his words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An insurance premium for good times and bad ... people's disabilities will not go away the next time we have a surplus.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is the backdrop against which I introduce this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why the government not only has bipartisan support for this bill; we have near-nationwide agreement on this scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the groundbreaking agreement with New South Wales last December, the other jurisdictions have joined the cause, one by one: South Australia, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and most recently the Northern Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        That means 90 per cent of Australians are now part of the plan, leaving only the people of Western Australia still waiting for a decision by their premier.
       </p>
       <p>
        People with disabilities and their families have campaigned so long to design and fund a national disability insurance scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of those advocates are watching here today, and they will be very focused on what is happening in this parliament. I want to take the time to welcome those in the gallery and so many beyond who are following proceedings today. I acknowledge you all now and I acknowledge, most importantly, the passion and dedication of so many people with disability, so many families and carers, who have brought the campaign to this point.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent weeks, as the momentum you have built has broken through, as we have struck agreements with states and territories and announced details of the funding, I have seen the hope and anticipation which Australians with disability, particularly young Australians, now share.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Saturday before last, I travelled to Melbourne to meet with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of Victoria
        </a>
        and sign my state, the state in which I live, to DisabilityCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Melbourne, I saw Sophie, a twelve-year-old girl who lives with Down syndrome.
       </p>
       <p>
        As her parents describe her, Sophie 'reads and writes, mucks around on the monkey bars, can be well behaved and badly behaved, runs like a billy goat, and is a budding photographer'.
       </p>
       <p>
        She took my photo while we were there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I travelled to Brisbane to meet Premier Newman and sign up Queensland to DisabilityCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I was there, I met Sandy, who is 17 and lives with a physical disability similar to cerebral palsy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sandy has big dreams for his future, like any teenager, but his future also has some big needs: mobility aids that cost tens of thousands of dollars, personal care to maintain his hygiene and physical therapy to maintain his muscles and his health.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I met this young man he handed me a card signed by him and his mates to say thanks for what we are doing for people with disability—a card illustrated by the photo Sophie had taken a week before.
       </p>
       <p>
        In years to come, DisabilityCare Australia will ensure Sophie and Sandy and so many other young people with disability will have the security and dignity every Australian deserves.
       </p>
       <p>
        This, above all, is why Australians are so overwhelmingly supportive of DisabilityCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past six years, the idea of a national disability insurance scheme has found a place in our nation's hearts.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March, we gave it a place in our nation's laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we inscribe it in our nation's finances.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people who have gathered here today from around the country to witness this debate know what this means.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be no more 'in principle' and no more 'when circumstances permit'.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be launches, not trials; permanent care, not temporary help.
       </p>
       <p>
        DisabilityCare starts in seven weeks' time, and there will be no turning back.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the House.
