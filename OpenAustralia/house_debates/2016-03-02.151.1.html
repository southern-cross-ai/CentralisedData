        I rise to share with the House some new programs that I have implemented in the Dobell electorate for the new school year. The first of these is known as the Kindy Reading Program. During my time as a federal member, I have made it my mission to be actively involved with the schools in Dobell. I am extremely fortunate that the majority of schools in my electorate recognise the benefits of having an open working relationship with me and the value this adds to student development, particularly through providing the students an opportunity to meet their local member of parliament, and not only learn firsthand about the parliamentary process, but also to provide me with an opportunity to assist them where I can.

        During a visit to a local school, I was disheartened to learn that some children commencing kindergarten have never read a book, nor had a book read to them. Even more disheartening is the fact that some children do not even own a book at home. Out of this, the Dobell Kindy Reading Program was born. Starting last year and now in 2016, the Kindy Reading Program is going full steam ahead. The Kindy Reading Program is very simple yet so effective. During a visit to the kindy class at the school, I sit with the students and we read a book together. Some of my favourite books include
        <i>
         Phoebe Digs Politics
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Big Bad Bushranger
        </i>
        two books that I sourced right here from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APH" rel="nofollow">
         APH
        </a>
        bookshop. After the book is read, it is donated to the school library for their use. My favourite part is that after the shared reading session I present each and every kindy student with their very own book to take home and keep. The pure joy on the children's faces when they receive their very own book to take home is sheer delight.

        The other program I have commenced for the 2016 year is the Year 6 Parliamentary Program. This involves visiting year 6 classes before their trip to Canberra, to provide them with some insight as to what to look for on their visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and some highlights to spot. It also provides an opportunity for the students to ask me questions about parliament and my role as their local member. The most interesting questions always come from our students. I must commend them for their interest in politics. When any school from Dobell visits Parliament House, I do my absolute best to meet with them. I like to present them a book about parliament, answer their questions and get that all-important photo on the marble staircase. However, as we are aware, sometimes schools are unable to attend Parliament House when parliament is sitting, and students can miss out on seeing the everyday workings of parliament. To counteract this, when I attend the classes as part of the Year 6 Parliamentary Program, I like to take items that they would not necessarily seeâ€”for example, videos of what happens when parliament opens. There are also a few cheeky hellos from various parliamentarians. So far this year, these two programs have had a fabulous uptake from local schools. Hopefully, the ones that have contacted me yet are not too far off. After all, this is all about our students.
