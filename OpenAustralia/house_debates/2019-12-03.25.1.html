        This petition by the citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that legislative changes are required to eliminate discrimination of older people with a disability. Older people are unable to access the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) after the age of 65. The maximum aged care Government subsidy of $49,000 per annum is insufficient for people who have extensive care needs, such as people who have quadriplegia. Regardless of age, people over the age of 65 with a disability should be entitled to access NDIS benefits to support them in receiving the care they require. ·

        I note today the presence in the gallery of Chris and Bobbie English, who started this petition, and many who support it. The petition is about drawing attention to the changes that are required to eliminate discrimination against older people with a disability. Chris English was enjoying his 69th birthday with his family when he suddenly fainted and fell. He became a quadriplegic. Had Chris English been aged 64 when the accident happened, he could have accessed an NDIS plan and up to $300,000 in support to meet his needs. Instead, being over 65, Chris is not eligible for NDIS and can only receive $50,000 under a My Aged Care plan. This is not meeting his needs. It is age discrimination and is impacting many others in Australia. We either need an exemption to NDIS for people aged over 65 who have an accident or illness, or My Aged Care needs to better cater for those with a disability unrelated to ageing. Thank you.
