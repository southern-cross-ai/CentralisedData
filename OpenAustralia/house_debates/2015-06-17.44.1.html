       <p>
        Madam Speaker, on indulgence: I do wish to inform the House that today we mourn the loss of a true gentleman of Australian sport,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Clarke
        </a>
        , who embodied the very best of sportsmanship.
       </p>
       <p>
        As members of a certain age might remember, at 19 years old he was chosen to light the Olympic flame at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Ron represented Australia at two Olympics and at three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        and over almost a decade on the international circuit he broke 17 world records. From 1965 to 1972 he held every world record for middle-distance running, a feat unmatched by any other athlete.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it was Ron Clarke's sportsmanship that defined his running career, a trait which he shared with his great contemporary,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Landy" rel="nofollow">
         John Landy
        </a>
        , who famously stopped mid-race to ask Ron if Ron were okay after a fall. Many Australians have been told the story of that race, and that race made Ron and John part of the Australian sporting pantheon.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was honoured many times. He was an Australian and an international sportsman of the year. He was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">
         MBE
        </a>
        and an Order of Australia. He was a successful businessman and author, and served as Mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        from 2004 until 2012. To Ron's wife, Helen, and their family I offer the sincere condolences of this parliament and the Australian people.

        <p>
         Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on indulgence. Today Labor honours the life of a magnificent sportsman and citizen. We offer our sympathies to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
          Ron Clarke
         </a>
         's family, friends and loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
         In December 1963 Ron broke his first two world records in the same race—the six mile and the 10,000 metre. In an astonishing two-month stretch in 1965, Clarke broke 11 world records in 16 races. For nearly seven years, Ron Clarke set every world record from, two miles to 20 kilometres. He will be forever immortalised in international athletics records.
        </p>
        <p>
         He won an Olympic bronze in the 10,000 metres in Tokyo and three Commonwealth silvers. After gruelling events over many years and thousands more miles he was in peak form for those two narrow Olympic windows—one week out of 208 weeks—every sinew and muscle in perfect condition. Ron Clarke's tenacity, determination and character were tested but never conquered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many reflecting on Ron's passing today will have in their minds the image of a young man, clad in white, carrying a sputtering Olympic torch into an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCG" rel="nofollow">
          MCG
         </a>
         packed with 103,000 spectators to begin the 'friendly games'. This was a 19-year-old carrying the hopes of a nation, proudly opening itself to the world. Incredibly, Ron was not even given a ticket to the ceremony. After he lit the torch he took the train and a bus to his uncle's house in Balwyn and watched the rest on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         !
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe the enduring message of Ron Clarke was to be one half of the most famous incident in Australian sport. At the Australian mile championship in Melbourne in March 1956, Clarke clipped the heel of a fellow competitor and he fell.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Landy" rel="nofollow">
          John Landy
         </a>
         , who was behind Clarke, tried to leap over him but he caught his spikes on Clarke's forearm on the way through. What happened next belongs to legend. Landy stopped and turned back to check on Clarke. Clarke got to his feet and assured Landy that he was okay. Landy then went on to catch the field and win the race. Much of the nobility of that event belongs to Landy, who sacrificed a world record. But it demonstrated respect for a young athlete who will forever be part of the moment as it is immortalised in bronze outside Melbourne's Olympic Park. He will be remembered for the graceful, resolute way he always bore his fortunes. He is an enduring message to all young Australian sportspeople. He is a vivid example of the Olympic ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
         In later life Ron became a great citizen. He served his community as Mayor of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Coast
         </a>
         . Ron Clarke filled every unforgiving minute with 60-seconds worth of distance run. We salute his life—a great citizen and a great sportsmen who ticked many boxes—and we offer our heartfelt condolences to his family. May he rest in peace.
