         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

          Climate Change
         </a>
         and Energy Efficiency, sub-contracted Pulse Electrical to conduct safety inspections under Phase 2 of the Home Insulation Safety Program (

          HISP
         </a>
         ). Transfield Services is headquartered in Sydney,

         ) and Pulse Electrical is headquartered in Stafford, Queensland.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Two Pulse Electrical employees attended an apartment complex in Hornsby, NSW on 6 July 2011. A total of eight units at 39 Albert Street, Hornsby had booked a safety inspection, with five completed that day and three aborted due to the householder being unavailable.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The total cost of the scheduled safety inspections was $6,545. This amount is yet to be reviewed and accepted by the Department. Costs are inclusive of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

         , travel, hire equipment, accommodation, materials and labour.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For the specific three month period, 6 April 2011 â€“ 6 July 2011, Pulse Electrical completed 170 safety inspections.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Although individual inspector details are available via completed inspection reports and provided to the Department, individual inspectors are employees of Pulse Electrical and it would be inappropriate to provide details of those employees.
