        As everyone in this place is aware, it is our responsibility as members to listen to our communities, to listen to what people are saying so we can bring those concerns back here to the parliament, represent those particular views and fight for a solution. Over the last couple of months in particular, when I have met with people on the southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the single biggest issue they have raised with me of concern is cost of living. Specifically, they are concerned about the cost to put a roof over their head, whether that be through purchase of a property—if they can find one—or a rental—if they can find one—or it is the general cost of living that comes through with food and grocery prices. Anecdotally, people have talked to me about how they have had to cut their costs. It hit home to me when I listened to one of our local coffee shop owners, who said that, yes, they were still getting similar numbers of customers coming through the store but those people who used to come in and buy coffee and lunch are now getting coffee and cake, and those who bought coffee and cake are coming in and just getting coffee. It is even at the point where people are starting to move away from the speciality milks and are starting to go back to buying dairy milk, which I am sure will be pleasing to many, but the issue is they are no longer willing, able, prepared, to pay the extra 50c, 70c or the dollar that that speciality milk costs them. This is something this parliament needs to take seriously. It is our responsibility to make sure we are dealing with cost of living.
