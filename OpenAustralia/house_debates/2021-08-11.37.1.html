        , Pat Rix is one of our leading examples. Back in 1997, Pat founded a small choir for people with intellectual disability. The choir grew into Tutti Arts. Thanks to Pat's vision and tireless work as director and founder, Tutti Arts is now an internationally acclaimed model where artists with disability create visual art, theatre, music, dance, film, digital media and installations for audiences everywhere.

        Pat understood the important role creative activities could have in the lives of people with a disability, increasing their confidence and increasing and developing their skills. As the director of Tutti Arts for the past 24 years, Pat has filled so many lives with joy, including the artists, their families and their adoring audiences. Pat has so much to be proud of, including her Australian of the Year 2007

        award for South Australia, but she deserves special recognition for working with her team and her board to relocate Tutti Arts to their new home at the former Saint Theresa's school site in Brighton with the support of the Brighton Catholic Parish and grants from the state and federal Liberal governments. I was honoured to attend the launch in August last year with Premier Steven Marshall and Mayor Amanda Wilson. Pat will be retiring in September, after 24 years leading her fantastic team at Tutti, leaving behind a tremendous legacy. Pat Rix, from the bottom of our hearts: we congratulate and thank you.
