        On Sunday, I had the opportunity to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Noarlunga" rel="nofollow">
         Port Noarlunga
        </a>
        Bowling Club open day ceremony for 2014-15, which celebrated the commencement of another lawn bowls season for this fantastic club. Indeed, it is at this time every year that the lawn bowls season commences. I was very pleased to be shown around by President Bryan to see the good work that the club is doing and the work that the volunteers in the club do as well. I was very pleased, and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate life member Dennis Lynch, who was inducted as the club patron.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, this weekend marked the commencement of another lawn-bowling season for the Port Noarlunga bowls club and also for lawn bowling across the state. I have a number of other great clubs in my electorate including Aldinga Bay,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Happy Valley
        </a>
        , Reynella, Christies Beach and

        </a>
        . Indeed, in the region there is also the McLaren Flat Bowling Club and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Vale" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Willunga bowling clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many local residents, lawn bowls is a growing and popular sport. It provides many people in our community with the opportunity to stay active and engaged in physical activity through competitive and team sport, to meet new people and engage in social activity or simply to have a great time. It is growing in popularity and is a growing attraction for Australians of all ages and all backgrounds who can get out, be active and have a great social timeâ€”although I would say that it can get quite competitive as well! I was very pleased that I did not have to participate in the opening of the season, because I think I would certainly have been shown up by many that were in the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is also an opportunity for me to recognise all the volunteers that ensure that our lawn bowls clubs get to be as great as they are. I know that so many volunteers in our lawn bowls associations and clubs work so hard to ensure that these clubs continue to thrive and prosper. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those volunteers and to wish everyone a very successful and competitive lawn bowls season both on and off the green. Port Noarlunga have shown that their club is very positive in welcoming the community, as I know that all other clubs in the electorate are. They extend their clubrooms and events to ensure that the community really is part of their bowling club. So, as I say, congratulations to all those, and I wish them all the very best for the season.
