        I rise today to recognise five special residents in the Paterson Electorate: Ronald Franks, Howard Grigor ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Bennett" rel="nofollow">
         Diane Bennett
        </a>
        , Doris Brooker and Charles Munnery. Each has made an outstanding contribution to the local community. They have now been honoured with the medal of the Order of Australia in the General Division. I would like to add my sincere congratulations and say you thank you on behalf of an entire electorate of Paterson which, through their contribution, has been made a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to say a few words about Medowie resident Howard Grigor. This is not the first time I have had the pleasure of recognising Howard who was Paterson’s citizen of the year in 2005. He is a decorated hardworking Rotary member who has travelled across the world to help others in need. He was also a driving force behind the restoration of Williamtown Hall and has worked extensively to better the lives of disabled people through programs such as Sailability and Riding for the Disabled.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the honour of awarding Paterson’s citizen of the year to Vacy resident Doris Brooker in 2009. She too has been recognised with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . The 96-year-old Doris has worked with the Country Women’s Association for more than 30 years and has been an active member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        for double that time. Doris has opened her home to many local people and she has been an inspiration for many more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next I would like to say a few words about Diane Bennett who has dedicated her time to others through the Clarence Town Rural Fire Brigade for more than 20 years. Diane was named Dungog citizen of the year in 2009 for doing what she loves and, testament to her dedication, told a journalist from the

        newspaper that she was embarrassed to be recognised at all. She said, ‘I just do what I do.’
       </p>
       <p>
        Ronald Franks, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks_Nest" rel="nofollow">
         Hawks Nest
        </a>
        , has been honoured for service as a volunteer. While being president of a community group is a big responsibility for any one person, Ron has been president of three groups and an active member of many more. These include positions with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">

        of

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Tea Gardens Motor Club. Ron was also the Tea Gardens
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch president for nine years and was instrumental in establishing the war memorial in Anzac Park.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to acknowledge Charles Munnery, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         Raymond Terrace
        </a>
        , who has worked with veterans, their families and the wider region for over half a century through Legacy and the RSL. He has helped raise vital funds for veterans, youth clubs and the disabled.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those five people have dedicated thousands of hours to people and places in the Paterson community and are a wonderful example of what we can all achieve. Today I would like to honour them and, again, say thank you. They set a brilliant example for others, and we can all take inspiration from their dedication.
