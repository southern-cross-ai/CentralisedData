        I would like to take this opportunity to briefly consider the highs and lows of this year. The low must have been on 1 July, when more than 700,000 Australians had their penalty rates slashed by the Turnbull government whilst, at the same time, a fortunate few received a tax cut. It seems no thought was paid to the economic and social impact that these cuts will have on the pay of our lowest paid workersâ€”and will continue to have on the local communities. If it was considered, this government simply didn't care. For many, penalty rates are not a luxury. They can be what pay the bills, send children to music lessons or put a gift under the Christmas tree.

        As a high point, I cherish the moment that support for marriage equality was formally announced. I did not support the survey. I thought parliament should have done its job, but I am proud to stand here as a representative from an electorate and a state that had a solid majority yes vote. Parliament must move quickly. It is now moving quickly to enact the will of the people and make marriage equality a reality. It is time to bring this issue to a close and move forward with kindness and goodwill to all on both sides. On that note, I would wish my constituents a safe and peaceful festive season, and a happy new year. I know that many people at the fringes of society have difficulties around this time of year, particularly at Christmas. I urge those people to seek the comfort of counselling services if they feel they need that.
