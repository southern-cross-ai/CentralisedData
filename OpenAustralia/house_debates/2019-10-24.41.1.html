        Today I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful lady Hazel Elaine Bushby, who passed away in Launceston over the weekend. Elaine served her community over a lifetime as a volunteer, faithfully and humbly working behind the scenes. Elaine's considerable service included with the Tasmanian Christian Endeavour Union, the

        </a>
        ladies auxiliary, Newstead Baptist Church, Launceston City Mission, Order of the British Empire Tasmanian association and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Women. Born in Hobart in 1934, Elaine began her training as a nurse in 1953 before marrying Max Bushby in November 1954. She was unable to complete her nursing training at that time as women had to resign upon their marriage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her husband Max was elected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_House_of_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmanian House of Assembly
        </a>
        in 1961, where he served until 1986. Together, Elaine and Max were quite a team. They were involved in many community organisations and together raised five children, including my parliamentary colleague Senator Wendy Askew and former senator

        , as well as Peter, Michael and Helen. In 2001, Elaine was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary Medal
        </a>
        for contributing to the care of people and improving the role of women in society. In 2017, she was inducted into Tasmania's Honour Roll of Women. Elaine's commitment to the community is to be admired and serves as an example to future generations. Vale Elaine Bushby.
