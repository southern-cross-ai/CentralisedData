        This week we celebrate Men's Shed Week, an annual event that aims to raise community awareness and knowledge of and interest in men's sheds. It is also the 30th anniversary of Men's Shed Week, which is an incredible milestone.

        In my own wonderful electorate of Chisholm, I have some remarkable men's sheds. The Monash Men's Shed is a registered health promotion charity and is a place where diverse activities are undertaken. This coming Sunday, 10 September, the Monash Men's Shed will be holding a tool sale and community indoor market at 77 Bogong Avenue in

        . As the recent proud owner of a gorgeous handmade chopping board from the shed, I can attest to the quality of the items. The Monash Men's Shed plays an important role in the improvement of the health and wellbeing of our community.

        woodworkers are another amazing local group. They make some absolutely incredible items, including very special handmade toys that are regularly donated to local charities, neighbourhood houses and kinders. These toys are treasured by the children who receive them. It is a pleasure to know and work with the group.

        The organisation has recently said goodbye to President Ray Ffrench, who'd served for 10 years. I want to thank you, Ray, for your inspiring leadership and the important part you've played in serving the community over the last decade.

        Our men's sheds are so important to our communities, and I'm so pleased to be able to support them here in the chamber today.
