       <p>
        I am delighted to rise today and update the House about my local community's campaign to save the Wentworthville Swimming Centre from closure. I am pleased to say that, after a strong and sustained community campaign,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holroyd_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Holroyd City Council
        </a>
        has at last voted to keep the centre open. It has made the right decision. This is an incredible community victory off the back of a grassroots movement and highlights just how effective people power can be when it mobilises to collectively fight for something at the heart of their local interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        For nearly five years I have been a vocal proponent of keeping this local landmark open. During this time I have been truly overwhelmed by the passion and tireless efforts of local residents, many of whom I meet at street meetings; on their way to work, at Toongabbie and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendle_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Pendle Hill
        </a>
        train stations; and through my petitions on this issue, where over 1,000 residents signed to keep this facility open. Specifically, I want to mention Councillor Lisa Lake, who took up the cause with gusto, even at times when all seemed lost. I am told that, during the recent Holroyd City Council meeting to decide the fate of the pool, representatives from Greenway's local schools, the learn-to-swim program, our swim clubs, learn-to-swim volunteers and local scouts and many individual local residents all impressed upon councillors the true value of this facility to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In celebrating this decision, I think of the countless positive effects it will have for my local community, including for residents such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Anderson
        </a>
        . Paul has spondylitis, a condition that affects the spine, resulting in the joints of the neck, back and pelvis becoming inflamed, causing great pain and stiffness. Paul would be lost without regular exercise at Wentworthville pool. 'I can hardly walk, and this is my only exercise,' he said. I think about our local families in an electorate where the number of families with children under four years is well above the national average. Many young families will continue to enjoy the babies' pool located at the centre. I think about our local schools that will continue to enjoy the benefits of instilling positive exercise habits in our children through school swimming carnivals and learn-to-swim classes. Indeed, that is where my own school's swimming carnivals were held.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, as we face challenges of chronic disease associated with conditions such as obesity and low-activity levels, we need to encourage exercise initiatives. We see that children who exercise have better concentration levels, and their ability to understand the school curriculum also improves. I think about members of the swimming club who will continue to enjoy taking part in a wonderfully healthy and social activity in the mornings. This year Wentworthville Swimming Centre will celebrate 50 years since its opening. It is truly a local landmark and an integral part of the Greenway community. Long may current and future generations continue to enjoy this important community facility. This truly is a victory for our local area.
