        Mincon are a fabulous company in my electorate. I joined Mincon for their 40th anniversary celebrations and the opening of their new manufacturing facility in Welshpool, an industrial area in my electorate of Swan. Mincon are an Irish company but operate in many countries, manufacturing drilling consumables for the global mining sector. In 2006 they opened up their first manufacturing facility in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and over the last decade they've continued to go from strength to strength, manufacturing materials for mining companies of all sizes across our great state. In the last 12 months alone, Mincon have invested over $1 million in their manufacturing facilities in Perth and have increased their workforce considerably. They have taken on three apprentices, who are working across their facilities and gaining real-life experience with an established company. A further $2 million has been allocated to invest in equipment over the next six months. In doing so, Mincon are confident they'll be able to grow the company in WA and employ more WA people. I know from my conversation with Mincon director,

        , how committed the company is to the manufacturing industry in WA. He said they believe it is the key to success in the mining sector.

        I would like to congratulate Jim and the team at Mincon on this milestone anniversary. I also had the opportunity to meet Paddy, who started the company many years ago back in Ireland. They are an example of what can be achieved through hard work and persistence. They are an iconic company in my electorate. I look forward to catching up with the team again and wish them every success.
