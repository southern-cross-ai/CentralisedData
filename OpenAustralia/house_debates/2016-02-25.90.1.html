          <p>
           I thank the member for Wright for his question. I acknowledge his strong interest in the welfare of the Defence men and women based in his electorate. He will be pleased to know that, pursuant to the government's
           <i>
            2016 Defence white paper
           </i>
           , defence spending will be increased by almost $30 billion over the next decade to protect Australia's security. This is a momentous announcement. I note that not one question was asked by the Labor Party today on the defence white paper. Not one question asked today by the shadow foreign minister or by anybody representing defence interests on the part of the Labor Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           This commitment is about safeguarding our interests around the world. It will increase our commitment to driving jobs, driving innovation, building industry skills and promoting competitiveness in Australia for decades to come. It will benefit the member's electorate in Wright. As the member knows, there are 600 Defence personnel currently located there. What we will be investing in is critical infrastructure across the country in bases, training ranges, wharves, airfields, information and communications technology, and science.
          </p>
          <p>
           Specifically, this means that for the first time all elements of the government's investment in defence are outlined in an integrated investment program. This program is going to deliver substantial benefits for electorates like Wright, including upgraded facilities at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
            Kokoda Barracks
           </a>
           to support our Defence Force's training capability. There is planned investment for the Kokoda Barracks of around $20 million out to 2025; an additional $200 million in the decade between 2025 and 2035. And, as the member for Wright well knows, this means more jobs, more services and a boost to the local economy. And this is a story that will roll out over Australia in towns and cities and electorates like Wright.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Kokoda Barracks at Canungra is a leading training facility, as the member said. It specialises in intelligence and preoperational deployment training. It is an integral service to maintain, especially as Australia looks to bolster its cybersecurity and we develop more innovative and agile technological capabilities to meet the 21st century challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           The member for Wright will be very pleased to know that this investment will ensure that the Kokoda Barracks in his electorate are sustainable and that they are well funded for the next two decades. He will be particularly pleased to hear, as will members on our side of the House—because the Labor Party asked not one question about this—that Australia has a defence force prepared for future challenges. We are ensuring that our Defence Force protects the people of Australia by investing in greater security in our region.
