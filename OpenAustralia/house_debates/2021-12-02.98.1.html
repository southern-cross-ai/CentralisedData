                 The member who asked the question would know of my deep interest in and concern for those Australians who suffer from multiple sclerosis. He'll be aware my brother-in-law has suffered with that condition for many years, and I will look forward to receiving the details of what the member has raised in relation to his question today. But, as the member will know from when he raised similar matters regarding other cases yesterday, I and the minister responsible have gone back to him on each of those casesâ€”and, as it turns out, in the matter of Harper's case, we were advised that Harper's current plan is in place for six months and includes a higher rate of funding than his previous 12-month plan. I wrote to the member advising him of this, so I look forward toâ€”

                       As I wrote promptly back to the member, following up the very issue he raised in this place yesterday, I was advised that National Disability Insurance Agency is in frequent contact with Harper's parents, and it is incorrect to say that Harper's current
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                        NDIS
                       </a>
                       funding has been reduced, including overnight supports. I'm advised that Harper's current plan is in place for six months and includes a higher rate of funding than his previous 12-month plan. It is important to consider comparable annualised plans, values and durations. NDIS plans are frequently implemented for a shorter period, such as six months, for participants with complex needs like Harper. It is also important to recognise that the NDIS works with mainstream service system, including the health system, to support families with additional support needs for health conditions.

We took his complaint seriously, we followed it up, we got back to him, and I've concluded my answer.

Likewise, the entire House can be proud of what we're all trying to do with the

                            </a>
                            . It is a world-leading endeavour. It started above politics, and I know we're all committed to keeping it above that. It's been a great privilege for many of us in this House to work on its rollout.

                            Today the NDIS supports more than 480,000 extraordinary Australians who are seeking to achieve their goals, their dreams and their aspirations. In 2013 we put the first participant into the scheme, and today, eight years later, we are approaching the milestone of half a million Australians. Prior to the NDIS, of course, support for those Australians with disability was fragmented across the Commonwealth, states and territories. Around $7 billion was spent annually, if you roll it all up, yet today in the July to September period this year alone, just three months in duration, the NDIS made payments of $6.4 billion to participants. That's a 350 per cent increase in just eight years, which goes to the extraordinary commitment of governments towards the scheme. In June 2014, just one year into the NDIS, there were 1,350 providers; today there are over 17,800. We should be proud of what we're achieving.

                            of People with Disability. The House won't be sitting, so it's incumbent that we use this day in this House to recognise Australians with disability and collectively seek to celebrate what they've achieved. I think it's important we take the opportunity to highlight the incredible work that the providers, carers, family members and those working in the disability sector do. They make a world of difference in the lives of extraordinary Australians.

                            simply say thank you to all those working in the area. It's the work that those beautiful Australians do to care for Australians with disability that allows those Australians to reach for the sky.

                            A great example in the member for Lindsay's electorate is the blind chef of Penrith. Craig is an incredible man. Beating childhood cancer, he went on to pursue a skilled career, becoming a fully qualified chef and, of course, working in some of Sydney's great establishments. Supported by the NDIS, he pursued his dream of opening his own joint, the Blind Chef Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar on Penrith's High Street. He employs Australians of all ability in his cafe. The cafe is designed for accessibility for all Australians. It's because of the great workers of the NDIS that the blind chef can continue to work today. Thank you to all of them.

                             My question is to the Prime Minister. Liam McGarrigle is an autistic young man. He and his family won a landmark case in 2017 over

                             transport funding that had implications for thousands of other people who rely upon the NDIS for support. But in November the Morrison government cut Liam's plan by $38,000, including his transport funding, bringing the family to tears. Prime Minister, how many individual participants like Liam have had their NDIS funding cut in the last 12 months?

                              I thank the member for Maribyrnong for his question. The minister is well aware of the concerns raised by Mrs McGarrigle in relation to the transport funding for her son Liam. The minister also received direct communication from Mrs McGarrigle a number of weekends ago, and he will be responding to the concerns that have been raised. On receipt of the concerns raised, the agency made contact with the family. I understand they have acknowledged the error that has been made in relation to the transport funding. The
