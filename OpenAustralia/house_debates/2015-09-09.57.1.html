         I call the Minister for Trade and Investment. There were a couple of questions just at the 28- and 29-second mark.

         <p>
          I thank the member for his question. Firstly, I think there are a few issues here to deal with for the member, but the most important is that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO" rel="nofollow">
           FIFO
          </a>
          policy has not only given us much of the wonderful prosperity and income and jobs over the last 15 years. Without FIFO, much of that development would never have taken place. Also, with the FIFO, you have to understand that standard business sponsors are currently required to undertake labour market testing prior to nominating any of these requirements for 457 visas. Unless exempted under international trade obligations by both sides of politics, our rules under this are identical to the rules that were under Labor for international trade agreements. So you will see that the FIFO policy is supported by both sides of politics and is supported by a very robust and a stringent 457 program which is supported by both sides of politics, as you have seen from the debate with ChAFTA. What we are doing is no different to what was done by those on the other side.
         </p>
         <p>
          The second point I would like to make about your question is that, for the Galilee Basin, the reason that wonderful deposit has not progressed is nothing to do with FIFO. The reason is the sabotage by green activists. They have laid down chapter and verse in the
          <i>
           Stopping the Australian coal export boom
          </i>
          report. This is their clear strategy. Let me read:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The first priority is to get in front of the critical projects to slow them down in the approval process.
         </p>
         <p>
          They want to disrupt and delay key infrastructure at any cost. That is your problem. Get on to the green activists. Companies like Adani, which has already spent $1 billion in seven years in approvals and has got every approval known to mankind, are still being held up again and again and again. It is trashing our reputation as a reliable investment country. It has nothing to do with FIFO and everything to do with this green sabotage.
