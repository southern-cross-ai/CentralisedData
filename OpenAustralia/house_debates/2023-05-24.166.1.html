       <p>
        In February last year I spoke in this place about Steven, a distressed father of two young boys, who inhaled from a friend's grape-flavoured vape in a primary school bathroom. Only a week later, Steven's five-year-old was frantically rushed to hospital, struggling to breathe. Steven's son now has an ongoing asthmatic condition. Stories like this are not uncommon. Parents and teachers are increasingly concerned about vaping and its role as a precursor to smoking and nicotine addiction. We know that over the past 12 months Victoria's poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under four becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge Steven and all the brave parents who have spoken out and advocated for legislation to better regulate vaping. As a result, I can proudly stand here today and declare that the Albanese government are listening and we are acting. Earlier this month, our health minister announced that the Commonwealth will contribute more than $730 million towards stamping out vaping and cigarettes. When the minister made this announcement, Steven dropped into my office with his boys to celebrate.

        When the minister made this announcement, Steven dropped by my office with his boys to celebrate. Steven said at the time:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm grateful for the efforts our current government is making. Everyone in our community should see and welcome the need for this change and the safe regulation of vapes …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To realise there was so little known about vaping, and the poisonous chemicals they contain, is frightening.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I love my children dearly, and to see this harm come to them never really leaves one's mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Steven, and for all parents, this reform is long overdue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our plan begins with the banning of single-use, disposable vapes, a public health information campaign on the dangers of vaping and funding for quit support programs. It will also include: an increase to the minimum quality standards for vapes by restricting flavours, colours and other ingredients; requirements for pharmaceutical-like packaging; reduction in the allowance of nicotine concentrations; and an increase in the tax on tobacco by five per cent per year for three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        No longer will we stand by as children as young as four inhale from these devices which can contain more than 200 toxic chemicals, causing cancer and other chronic lung conditions. Some of those chemicals are found in nail polish remover and weed killer. This is unacceptable. No longer will we stand by and allow vaping to create another generation of nicotine addicts.
