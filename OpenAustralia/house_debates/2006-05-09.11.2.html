        My question is to the Minister for Vocational and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Technical Education
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware that 39 Australian employees have been sacked from the Ballarat manufacturing company Maxi-TRANS while that same company has retained 25 employees imported from China on temporary skilled migration visas? Isn’t this the same company that last year put on hold eight Australian apprenticeships after it imported welders from China? Minister, why have these Australians living in my electorate, who were employed without sick leave, annual leave, holiday loading or any long-term employment contracts, now lost their jobs while imported workers have been given greater job security? Is this what the minister meant when he said in this place last year:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So I would invite the member for Ballarat to celebrate the fact that a local business is investing in itself and the local region and creating more job opportunities for more young people around Ballarat.

         I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. It has been 266 days since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         asked a question of me in this place about training, about skills or about apprenticeships. It was on 16 August last year, which was the 28th anniversary of the death of Elvis, for the people who want to know.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has committed more money to the business of training apprentices than anybody else in history. The results are amazing: 397,800 new apprentices in training—a 146 per cent increase, or an extra 161,000 new apprentices since 1996; 139,600 new apprenticeship completions in this last year—a 314 per cent increase since 1996, or an extra 33,700 completions; 168,200 commencements in trade and related occupations—a 33 per cent increase—

              My point is: what is the member for Ballarat really on about here? In the last 10 years there has been a 286 per cent increase in the number of people in training in Ballarat—almost 4,000 people. In the case of MaxiTRANS, the member for Ballarat has to account to the people of her electorate as to why she is attacking a company that employs a total of 577 Australians—
