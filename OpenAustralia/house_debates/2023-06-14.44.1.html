       <p>
        I'm proud to be a part of a government that is taking action and recognises that we are in a climate and biodiversity emergency, and I am proud that we are doing something meaningful about it. I would also like to acknowledge the many members of local governments from across Australia who have converged on Canberra for the Australian local governments conference, some of whom join us in the gallery today. Local governments are connected to our communities and, like Darebin city council and the

        </a>
        which service my electorate, these councils have led in this debate across recent times. They declared a climate emergency as early as 2019. Local governments across Australia have followed suit, leading the calls for action in the absence of leadership under the previous Morrison, Turnbull and Abbott governments. We are changing that and we are heeding the calls.
       </p>
       <p>
        We recognise the urgency required for us to act and we are implementing detailed policy across all areas of government. Whether it be implementing the legislated target towards net zero; the establishment of an environment protection Australia, the first of its kind federally; doubling the funding for the marine science institute; setting a target of zero extinctions; the new bill to create markets for landowners to undertake biodiversity projects; and so much more, we are showing leadership where the previous government completely declined even to show up. So I say 'thank you' to those all around the country who are leading this debate. We have a lot more work to do, and we will partner with other governments to get this done.
