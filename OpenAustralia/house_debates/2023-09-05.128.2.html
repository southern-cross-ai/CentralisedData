       <p>
        I rise to speak on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023. The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting people to overcome barriers to getting and keeping paid work and to ensuring people can access and develop the skills they need for the jobs of today and the jobs of tomorrow. This bill supports this important work by ensuring that legislative authority for government spending on programs targeted towards that commitment is achieved in the best possible way.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former government rushed through the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2022, known as the SPROM bill, shortly before the last election. That bill made significant changes to social security law, including inserting chapter 2D into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Act
        </a>
        . While Labor ultimately voted in support of the bill, we raised concerns at the time that the former government mishandled the bill by rushing through that consideration. The changes to chapter 2D of the Social Security Act commenced in April 2022. The purpose of the changes was to provide more streamlined legislative authority for spending on employment programs. The explanatory memorandum for when chapter 2D was introduced stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … all that the new Chapter 2D does is provide statutory authority for expenditure … All of the usual processes and requirements for the establishment and oversight of such programs will remain unchanged.
       </p>
       <p>
        While chapter 2D is achieving this purpose, its operation will be improved through the technical amendments in this bill. This bill ensures that chapter 2D continues in the best possible way to provide more streamlined legislative authority for spending aimed at supporting Australians to get and keep paid work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment in Australia remains at historic lows, currently 3.5 per cent. Nearly half a million more Australians are in work today than when Labor came to government a little over a year ago. As far as the Albanese Labor government is concerned, when somebody wants a job and gets a job, that is a success. We're also committed to making sure that those jobs are well paid and secure so workers can look after themselves and their loved ones. It's why we twice backed a pay rise for Australian workers on the minimum wage, why we backed and funded a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers, why we have introduced a better and fairer bargaining system and why, this week, the minister has introduced a bill to close the loopholes for workers, which is such an important step to ensuring workers are safe, that their wages aren't stolen and a whole range of changes that will mean so much to so many Australians. However, we know there are still people who want to work and are finding it hard to get a job. The government is working to try to make sure that we can get a better deal for those individuals as well. An improved chapter 2D will support spending on that important work.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this bill is, as its name suggests, a miscellaneous measures amendment, a bit of a change that, in itself, is not necessarily that interesting to speak about, it is very important. It shows our government's commitment to getting our social security system right. It's my belief that we as Australians don't take the pride that we should in our social security system. As Australians we are proud of Medicare and universal health care. We're proud of our tradition of a fair system of wages and conditions for workers. We're proud of public education. We recognise that these things are all part of what makes us a relatively egalitarianism society when you compare us to somewhere, for example, like the United States. We are proud of that. We like to think we are the country of the fair go.
       </p>
       <p>
        But when we talk about our social security system in a way that makes people who receive those payments somehow sound undeserving or somehow like they're not trying, we are not doing justice to that incredibly important policy area and what it means to so many Australians and to the futures of people. All of us at some point might access our social security system, and most of us do. So it's important that we recognise the importance of this policy area and the power that it has to lift people out of poverty and to give people opportunities that they may not otherwise have.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, having a job is the best way to secure a decent standard of living for yourself and for your family. I'm sure this is something that Labor, the party of workers, absolutely believes in. As I said, unemployment is currently at a record low under our government, but there are still around a million people looking for work, relying on our social security system and receiving the JobSeeker payment. There are more who receive the other range of pensions and allowances and family payments that are provided by that system.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we go back to around the time of Federation, Australia was one of the first countries in the world to establish a universal age pension—by universal, I mean anyone can receive it; obviously, it's means tested. Many other countries in the world have an insurance model where you actually put away for your age pension through your working life and that determines what you can access. We had a universal age pension. Soon after that, we introduced support for single parents, and mothers predominantly. This was very early on after Federation. Around that same time, the Harvester judgement was given, which recognised that people should receive a decent amount of money through their work to support themselves and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those two things went hand in hand to ensure that we had a decent standard of living in Australia. These things have historically been important. It's why Francis Castles coined the term 'the wage earners' welfare state'—that is, you can look at Australia as a place where the welfare state, which is highly targeted, is for those who can't support themselves through a job. That is very much the case to this day. We have one of the world's most targeted social security systems, which means that the money goes to those on the lowest incomes and most in need. While the system is often called complex, there are reasons for that, meaning that it is targeted to those most in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm taking the opportunity on this bill—which is around this important, if not particularly exciting, amendment—to talk about this system. It's critically important to all Australians and to us having equality in our society and to making a difference in the lives of so many Australians. We should take more pride in this policy area.

        </small>
        <p>
         Today I rise to speak about something that has a direct impact on each and every one of our constituents. In my electorate of Adelaide and across Australia, one of the No. 1 issues is jobs: people finding sustainable jobs that provide an income and jobs that give them the future. The stability of our support systems is also important, as they go hand in hand, as do our efficiency and reliability as representatives in this place. The goal is clear: to ensure people can access and develop the skills they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow and to provide a secure system that Australians can lean on should they need our help.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just over a year ago, when the Albanese Labor government took office, things looked a little different. Today, nearly half a million more Australians have jobs. Our country's unemployment rate is at a historic low of just 3.5 per cent. It's a success we can all be proud of, but our work is far from done. It's about ensuring that people get the jobs they want and supporting them every step of the way. Some people may need more support than others; others may need less support. The job of governments is to support them every step of the way to get those jobs, from upskilling to landing a job all the way through to retirement.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our roles as federal members of parliament, we're here to help and assist our constituents navigate those pathways, whether it be the social security system or the Centrelink system or through training for employment and a whole range of other areas. I'm sure everyone in this place, just like my office does, receives calls from constituents who need assistance with Centrelink matters. These people that call us come from all walks of life. Some are older, some are younger, some have high skills, some have lower skills. They all have different stories but they all share one common factor—that they contact us because they need our assistance. They reach out, usually stressed, unsure, upset at times. One of the things that fills me with pride as a member of parliament is that, more often than not, we can provide some guidance and some help to get them the support they need. Not long ago, a woman came to me who was struggling with the Centrelink system while trying to secure aged care for her husband. While this isn't directly related to employment or skills development, it showcases the power of responsive government. By working together and following established protocols, navigating the system we found a solution that relieved her and her husband of that significant stress.
        </p>
        <p>
         These stories, like many others, show the importance of the bill we are discussing here today. They remind us our work goes beyond legislation; it impacts the lives of everyday Australians. It demonstrates the real-world value of a government that listens and acts. It's our duty to ensure all Australians, regardless of their circumstances, can look forward to a future filled with some form of hope, security and prosperity, whether it be access to aged care or access to programs in pursuit of securing that job. We need to continue to work to clear the pathway forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this bill, chapter 2D plays a pivotal role in ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of our support system. It's not just about a set of rules and regulations; it's a framework that empowers us to provide timely and responsive assistance to those who need it most. Chapter 2D provides statutory authority for expenditure and is the backbone of the financial support system that millions and millions of Australians rely on every day—sometimes for a very short period and at other times for a longer period, but no doubt many Australians rely on this particular system.
        </p>
        <p>
         The recent changes to chapter 2D introduced in April 2022 were aimed at providing more streamlined legislation authority for spending on employment programs. These changes were essential to ensure our support programs remain relevant and effective in the ever-changing job landscape. While chapter 2D has been effective in achieving its intended purpose, it's important to understand that constant improvement is key to ensuring we meet the evolving needs of our constituents. This bill ensures chapter 2D continues to evolve. In essence, it reinforces the commitment to delivering efficient and responsive support to all Australians and ensures we continue to adapt to the challenges and opportunities that people in the job market encounter every day—and our commitment extends over a long-term period. It's essential to establish support right from the beginning, and that starting point is securing a job.
        </p>
        <p>
         Equally important is our dedication to ensuring these jobs provide good pay and good security, which then gives people peace of mind for the future. Our constituents, the Australian public, need to be able to take care of themselves and their families. This is why we twice backed a pay rise for Australian workers on the minimum wage. It is why we backed and funded a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers and why we introduced a better and fairer bargaining system.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these achievements, we acknowledge that there are still people in our community who want to work but are finding it hard to secure a job. The government is tirelessly working to ensure that we can provide better opportunities for them as well. An improved chapter 2D will support spending on that important work, and that important work is ensuring we can bridge that gap for those who are seeking meaningful employment. So, in supporting this bill, we're not only reaffirming our commitment to the wellbeing and dignity of fellow Australians but also taking concrete steps to ensure that the system works efficiently. That allows us to continue assisting our constituents in navigating a way through.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023 represents a pivotal step towards fulfilling that commitment to supporting Australians in pursuit of employment. As a federal member of parliament and the federal member for Adelaide, I'm personally invested, as I'm sure all of us here are, in the wellbeing and future of my constituents. We constantly hear their struggles, trials and tribulations and listen to their hopes and wishes. We all need to let them know that they can rely on this place, on this government and this parliament, to provide those opportunities, to foster security and to ensure a brighter future for every Australian. I will be supporting this bill, and I'm hoping that everyone will be doing so, so we can reaffirm that shared commitment to a stronger and fairer Australia. It's not just a set of rules and regulations, as I said earlier; it's a framework that empowers us to provide timely, responsive assistance to those who need it most.
        </p>
        <p>
         While chapter 2D has been effective in achieving its intended purpose, it's important also to understand that, as I said earlier, constant improvement is key to ensuring that we meet the evolving needs of the Australian public. It's a commitment that transcends party lines and political differences because, at its heart, through the operation of the technical amendment bill, it will work to improve the lives of Australians. The amendments ensure a clear and consistent framework for social security programs. It reduces the confusion in ensuring that individuals have access to the support that they are entitled to, ensures that they know how to navigate it and makes that process simpler. It's particularly crucial for the people of my electorate and of Australia who may rely on these programs and who deserve clarity, consistency and efficiency, and that's what this does.
        </p>
        <p>
         I urge everyone to support this bill. It will help in continuing to build Australia as a nation that genuinely cares for its people. We must share that collective promise to help our constituents, to reduce stress and to offer clear explanations. It's about empowering those who seek our help to navigate challenging circumstances with confidence and dignity. As we're deliberating on this bill, remember that it's more than just the piece of legislation; it will affect people's lives in a good way. It reflects, as I said, our shared commitment to being there for one another, to ensure that every Australian can face challenges with the knowledge that they will have the support and the pathways readily available for them.
