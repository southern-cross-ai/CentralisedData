       <p>
        It's a great pleasure to update the House on an issue I have updated the House on a number of times, and that is the Willetton basketball stadium expansion project. It's a project I fought very hard for to ensure that 50 per cent of the funding was coming from the Commonwealth. I was very excited when the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , visited the stadium to look at the plans to build another four courts and improve facilities. It is a project that will mean fewer kids on waiting lists and more kids playing active team sport in my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very pleased with the Commonwealth's commitment of $5.5 million. The Canning Council put $2.2 million towards this project. We were waiting for a $2 million commitment from the state government, but they short-changed the association, with only $1.5 million. So, on Monday, when they made that announcement, we couldn't celebrate the fact that it was going ahead. But, after the Willetton Basketball Association Board had their meeting last night, they decided that they can make the stadium a reality. The board was disappointed with the shortfall in funding from the WA government, but feedback from the community means that they have confidence that they can meet that shortfall within their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the federal government for their contribution, I thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Canning" rel="nofollow">
         City of Canning
        </a>
        for their contribution and I thank the state government for their contributionâ€”albeit short. I look forward to working with the volunteers, the players and the entire Willetton basketball community to make sure that this project is a reality as soon as it can be.
