        I rise today to address some inaccurate information being distributed in my electorate of Hasluck by Labor Senator Glenn Sterle. On Friday, the senator distributed a letter, which I have right here, claiming that the Gateway WA project would not be delivered under an Abbott led government. I refer the senator to the shadow minister for transport's commitment before the 2010 election that the infrastructure funding would be provided in future
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">

        funding rounds under a coalition government. The coalition does not need a great big tax to deliver these essential infrastructure projects and the senator should not be purporting otherwise.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the senator is correct in stating that I voted against the mining tax. I voted against the mining tax because it will adversely affect the future of many businesses and individuals within the community of Hasluck. A number of people and businesses, such as HVLV and the Pilbara Access Group, depend on a thriving mining industry to succeed. Rather than playing cheap politics, the senator should instead be worried about the wider impacts of the mining tax and the carbon tax. The carbon tax comes into effect on 1 July and will impact on the families, businesses and residents of Hasluck. Under the carbon tax, the cost of living will increase for everyone in our community. Electricity prices will go up, using the government's own figures, by at least 10 per cent and gas prices will rise by nine per cent. This is a cost the community of Hasluck does not need. The carbon tax will have a disastrous effect on small businesses as well. The senator needs to walk the walk to deliver.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated categorically before the last election:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
       </p>
       <p>
        What the senator really needs to do, instead of distributing clearly false information, is explain why he voted for the carbon tax, why he voted to put even more cost pressure on families and local businesses and why he supported a tax which was never wanted by the Australian people and which the Prime Minister promised was not going to be implemented under this Labor government. No matter what short-term compensation is given to families, they know that Labor cannot promise that they will not be worse off under this tax. I have residents contacting me daily saying they cannot believe the financial mismanagement and mess that this government has created. The senator needs to stop the inaccuracies and the falsehoods and start standing up for the community of Hasluck in

        instead of playing cheap politics. Information is often sent within the realms of politics, but it needs to be accurate. It needs to reflect the truth of the matter and look at the commitments that are made by the coalition.

        project was also a state government initiative. It is a Commonwealth-state initiative and will be delivered under the guidance of the state government.
