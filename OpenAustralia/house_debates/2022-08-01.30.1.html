         In 2022 the Australian people showed us the way. Self-interest is out and the national interest is in, but it's planetary and interspecies interests that are trending. Our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         people have known this for eons. I am looking forward to enshrining their voice in our constitution and embedding their wisdom into our ways. I am honoured to stand on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am the unlikeliest of politicians: no political experience in the conventional sense, no history with the Labor Party and no political pedigree. People ask: 'How did this happen? How did you make history? How did lifelong conservatives vote Labor?' In no other country nor electorate would my story even be possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was the pandemic that led to my political awakening. In the first half of 2020 I stopped sleeping as I watched healthcare workers in Italy die. Hospitals resembled war zones. Patients lined corridors. Death was everywhere. At my hospital, colleagues in hushed tones disclosed to me concerns about their safety at work. They felt powerless against a medical establishment that steadfastly held that COVID was spread by droplets and surgical masks were fine. At that time vaccines were a pipedream and we were going into battle with sticks rather than lightsabres.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had to act. I tried corridor diplomacy, but hit brick walls. Aerosol scientists were shouting from the rooftops that COVID was airborne, floating in the air like smoke, slipping through the gaps in our masks and around the perspex screens that had sprung up like weeds. At the time, I would have been safer cracking rocks underground than working on a hospital ward. Miners had access to the best respiratory equipment, like machines that kept deadly particles out of their lungs, and they had the licence of their
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         and board, who were liable if things went wrong. It's a credit to our mining industry and unions that they have these standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, nurses and doctors were having the right masks ripped out of their hands due to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
          PPE
         </a>
         shortages. Staff infections spread to the community, triggering an extension of lockdowns while we waited for the vaccines to arrive. And we waited—while people got sick or got sick of lockdowns. It was cold comfort to my doctor husband and me that we had sorted out our wills. At least my children would be fine if their parents died. As it transpired, the cure for my insomnia was activism. Speaking truth to power brought a psychic peace. It was my political awakening that helped me sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         With like-minded colleagues, I co-founded Health Care Workers Australia and advocated for better: for masks that fit your face; for transparent reporting of healthcare worker infections, because you can't improve what you can't measure; for recognition that COVID is spread through the air; and for better national guidelines, because they determine our safety in hospitals, aged care, schools and businesses. I urged the then government to broaden our limited vaccine repertoire, because I could see variants coming.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of my proudest works was the first Australian study documenting the experiences of healthcare workers. 'Hearing the voices of Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic' says it all. Their stories were the reason for the season.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I've learnt, I now bring to parliament—that is, the need to listen to the front line. Whether it's health care, business or the environment, those at the coalface know the problems and will proffer solutions before they become crises. That is the wisdom of the edge. National leadership that prioritises work health and safety is essential. Healthy, happy workers make the economy hum, especially in mission-critical industries like health care, aged care, education or business. This much we owe to our nurses, doctors, allied health professionals, paramedics, support staff and educators, whose deep wells of altruism are nearly dry. A future
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
          CDC
         </a>
         must prioritise the welfare of our first responders, because there is no pandemic response without them. Today I pay tribute to my friend Millie, a nurse, and my friends Marco and Sarah, doctors, who are in the gallery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Watch out for the tail. It has a sting. For COVID, it will be chronic disease and mass illness disrupting lives and constraining our productivity for years to come. This is not inevitable but depends on what we do next. Cleaning the air is one important but neglected lever that will help apply downward pressure. National guidelines on ventilation will empower our people and businesses to stay safe and live more freely. It will spawn a new industry in air safety, making us more resilient against respiratory viruses and a future disease X.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diversity is the antidote to groupthink, so welcome those contrarian voices. The discomfort leaders like us feel when hearing what we don't like from people with skin in the game is usually a good thing. They are often the truth-tellers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, be aware that the four most dangerous words in science are, 'there is no evidence'. These four words have shut the gate on life- and economy-saving measures. When there is no evidence, then default to common sense and err on the side of caution until daylight emerges.
        </p>
        <p>
         After experiencing the powerlessness of not being listened to, I understand the profound power of being heard. It's a lesson I carried with me to the streets and the homes of Higgins. I had thousands of conversations, walking up and down our electorate in my gold runners. It was a real grassroots campaign, powered by the greatest force for good—people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Higgins is 39 square kilometres—a little bit smaller than Lingiari—and encompasses
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yarra" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         with its famous
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Street" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , the iconic Prahran market, the stately homes of Toorak, the leafy streets of Malvern and Armadale with their vibrant small businesses, south to the multicultural foodie hub of Koornang Road, Carnegie, bordered by the wide, quiet streets of Murumbeena,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Iris" rel="nofollow">
          Glen Iris
         </a>
         and Ashburton. Dog walkers abound, parents grab coffees between pick-ups, young people jog the streets, school kids jumble into trams. Since its inception in 1949, Higgins has been a Liberal stronghold, until now. It has produced two prime ministers, Gorton and Holt, four if you include Menzies and Fraser, who lived there. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the former member for Higgins Dr Katie Allen for her contribution to public life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Higgins is a high-performance electorate where people are self-made or well on the way but disadvantage hides in plain sight. I observed too many young adults in full-time work still tethered to their parents, unable to buy a home. I met a young mum unable to return to full-time work because she could not afford $200 a day on child care. Marion, an educator who had been on a casual contract for over a decade, was now facing the prospect of losing her home because her hours had been cut. A small-business owner cried every night because she is exhausted by the pressures of the past two years. And I lost count of the number of male retirees, and they were always men, who demanded I tax them more because they were appalled at the level of inequality in our society and didn't need the 'welfare'—their words not mine.
        </p>
        <p>
         People from every background and belief were inspired to make a change at that election because they understood what it meant for our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is an electorate beating with a lion heart.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dr Ennis, an endocrinologist and Higgins resident of 50 years, sums it up. As a child he asked his father who he should vote for. His father replied, 'Families like ours always do well when the Liberal Party are in government but sometimes you have to do what is best for everyone and what is best for the community. That's why I always vote Labor.' Three days after Dr Ennis died, Higgins returned its first Labor member. Dr Ennis did his bit; now will I do mine.
        </p>
        <p>
         The people of Higgins will judge us by the force of our actions rather than the froth of our words, as Churchill said. But listening to locals, hearing their stories on front steps and on the end of the phone became for me the reason for the season.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the people of Higgins: I carry with me your wishes and your worries into government. It is a humbling and heavy responsibility, and I thank you for it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I could not have climbed this mountain without the support of my incredible volunteer army, the Labor branches who came and gave; my friend the member for Macnamara, who reached out and mentored me; my campaign team, Michael, Josh, Jet; and all of my Labor colleagues here, including the frontbench, pretty much the whole frontbench; and the Prime Minister for their generous support. Prime Minister, you're calm, considered approach imbued with wisdom and kindness is just the medicine our country needs. To my husband, you are a tower of strength. To my teenagers Annika and Ash, you are far more accomplished than I was at your age. Look outwards always and make a positive contribution to this world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today is bittersweet because not everyone could make it. My sister is caring for a child with COVID and my brilliant colleague Nada is laid low with long COVID after two bouts of illness, but she is watching. Such is the pandemic's long reaching shadow. But we can and must push back against this shadow because our party, after all, is the light on this hill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing is built without a foundation, and mine was laid by my parents Robert and Vimala. My father came from a village in northern
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">

         , the middle of seven children to a single mother, having lost his own father when he was 12. That he rose to become an accountant and small-business owner raising three professional children is nothing short of a miracle. My mother juggled full-time work and running a home, turning out delicious meals to the strains of Elvis and Abba. As Tamils, my parents left Sri Lanka in the 1960s due to ethnic tensions. I was born in the

         then moved to Zambia where I lived for 12 years before coming to Australia on the skilled migration program in 1984 when I was 11. In Zambia, I went on safari in the way my kids go to the beach: gripping on for dear life in the back of a Land Rover, awestruck as a little kid in front of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Falls" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Falls
         </a>
         —a torrent of water known as Mosi-oa-Tunya, 'the smoke that thunders'. But it was Australia that made me an infectious diseases and general medicine physician, an academic, activist and now a parliamentarian. What a country! My story is one of intergenerational upward mobility, where education and hard work bent the arc of our lives. But that wasn't all. A person like me, who has experienced more headwinds than tailwinds, benefited from the Hawke and Keating economic legacy, a Catholic education and a cohesive society that welcomed a stranger.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a lexicon for economic progress, ranging from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         to unemployment figures, but we lack the language for social cohesion. And yet it is like money in the bank: social capital put away in good times to be drawn down in bad. As a migrant, I have watched with alarm as words used in this chamber ricochet around the country, tearing at our social fabric. Spillover effects are acts of hate on our streets against Asians, Jews, Muslims, people of colour, the gender diverse. And the gun gets fired here. We have a choice. We can accept the politics of division or devalue that currency to junk. I am proud that the Australian people and the people of Higgins did just that. 'Do better,' they cried. The triumph of modern Australia—a diverse multicultural nation—is worth celebrating every single day. Social capital is our true sovereign wealth fund, that, if managed well, will pay a dividend to us, its shareholders, forever.
        </p>
        <p>
         Standing in this chamber, I still feel the pull of medicine: a rewarding career of service and advocacy that will be extended here. I saw, for 25 years, the sins of society wash up in our public hospital system: homelessness, poor education, childhood trauma, social isolation, poverty, racism, unemployment and climate change. According to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
          WHO
         </a>
         , these so-called social determinants of health can account for over half of all health outcomes, where one problem reinforces another. Health is all about context. For example, diabetes clusters with poor nutrition and poverty.
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet" rel="nofollow">
           The Lancet
          </a>
         </i>
         describes syndemics, the synergistic interaction of social, economic and environmental factors. It's a framework relevant to our future CDC, but just as pertinent to this place too. I prescribe pills for problems rooted in disadvantage, but these are problems that need a parliament, not a prescription pad.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a doctor, I saw things as they were. Now, as a parliamentarian, I see things as they could be. The venerated fair go, much like our safety at work, does not happen by luck. Barriers must be identified and dismantled, like inequality and unconscious bias so that, as Kennedy said, man has the freedom to grow to his full stature. Structural reforms must be introduced and embedded until they become part of the furniture, like Labor's Medicare. For women, the motherhood penalty clips our wings just as we unfurl them after years of slog and study. In the blur of home and work, years slip by, and ambition is dimmed until it snuffs out altogether. That double shift nearly broke me, which is why I am delighted that child care has been elevated in the economic agenda. With mountains of work to do, who can afford to leave the talent of women on the table? It makes me proud that the Labor caucus is now 52 per cent women—and they are fierce. And 50 per cent of our new Labor members are from culturally diverse backgrounds, including First Nations. It makes me even prouder that Higgins had something to do with this high watermark.
        </p>
        <p>
         Within the seams of the bedrock of our ancient land, like precious ores, lie new ways of thinking. The One Health model encompassing human, animal and environmental health immediately elevates stewardship. Our First Nations have known this all along. We cannot privilege one above the other, because we are nourished both physically and spiritually by the natural world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Climate change is the threat multiplier, adding pressure to every system and every sector in society, but its effects will be unequally felt, so ironing out inequality now is a matter of urgency. Obama said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our journey to a low emission future will be contingent on taking our coal and gas communities along. We owe them much, and we are, after all, the party of the Hunter and Higgins—a broad church indeed! A land crisscrossed by zero emission high-speed rail will bring our regions closer to us and us to them, triggering a regional boom. On intergenerational justice, the cries are only getting louder. An affordable home backed by secure work is like the warmth of a million suns. It should be the norm, not the exception.
        </p>
        <p>
         Innovation will be key to solving many of these challenges. For that, we must again embrace the power of listening. As a nation we produce excellent research but need to do better at commercialising it. Our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhDs" rel="nofollow">
          PhDs
         </a>
         want to be CEOs of their own start-ups. I was a Research Australia finalist last year for my work on artificial intelligence but had been underfunded for years. It shouldn't be this hard. Unless things change, and fast, we will continue to lose our best young minds in

         of funding.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Higgins I met John, a postdoc. who was taking up a biomedical fellowship in the

         because he felt like Australia had given up on him. To get great research into the market requires the science of implementation, but implementation science withers on the vine if we devalue the humanities, our creatives and social sciences. There is a big difference between inventing vaccines in the lab and getting them into arms—one is a science, the other an art. Different but complementary skills are needed, so let's usher in a flourishing of enterprise, embracing the diversity that makes us stronger than the sum of our parts.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is said that the people perish when there is no vision. Mine is for an inclusive, sustainable and competitive Australia. As a nation, we have an embarrassment of riches, hearts bursting with aspirations, bodies alive with animal spirits, brains fizzing with ideas. Our task as leaders is to listen to our frontline and knock down their barriers, reject short-termism in favour of generational investment—raising, not dimming, ambition so that our people take flight and soar. Because only by unifying, empowering and electrifying our people can we reach that cleaner, greener, fairer future. I thank the House.

          <p>
           I'd like to begin this address by reading out the names of four people who grew up in regional Australia. They are four people who by virtue of when and where they were born had limited opportunities, but they used what opportunities there were to create a significant legacy for those who followed. The regional Australians I want to mention are Richard and Eileen Birrell and Ray and Molly Dunham. They have passed. I'm sure they never would have thought that they'd be spoken about in this chamber, but their lives and their ethics tell us an important story. They were my grandparents.
          </p>
          <p>
           They were born in regional Australia just after the end of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            First World War
           </a>
           and, as a result, their early teenage years coincided with the ravages of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
            Great Depression
           </a>
           . They had little opportunity for formal education, as they had to leave school at a young age to support their families. Their work was tough, but work did at least exist, due to the developing agricultural and food-processing industries in the regions. They then experienced the danger and deprivation of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            Second World War
           </a>
           and, after that, started families. They were determined to work as hard as they could to ensure that their children had a chance at educational opportunities that they never had.
          </p>
          <p>
           My parents, Brian and Sue, both from different parts of regional Victoria, met at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_University" rel="nofollow">
            Melbourne University
           </a>
           , and after their studies came to the

            Goulburn Valley
           </a>
           , as the prosperity of this region offered opportunities—my father-in-law and my mother as a teacher. I was, therefore, lucky enough to be born into this amazing part of regional Australia. I spent my childhood growing up on the banks of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulburn_River" rel="nofollow">
            Goulburn River
           </a>
           , or the Kaiela, as it's called in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorta_Yorta" rel="nofollow">
            Yorta Yorta
           </a>
           language. I have three younger sisters: Emily, Sarah and Hannah. We remain close as adults. Our family life was always one where questions were encouraged, intellectual curiosity was ubiquitous and the overwhelming ethic was that people were to be cared for.
          </p>
          <p>
           After formative years at school in Shepparton and then as a border at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_College" rel="nofollow">
            Assumption College
           </a>
           in Kilmore, I was looking for opportunities, but, as a disorganised and unstructured young man, this took a little while. But in the regions the community have your back. I found work on a fruit and cattle farm in Ardmona, just near the city of Shepparton. I recall with great appreciation the support my mother, Sue, gave me at this time in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
           I love agriculture. I was proud of what I was doing, helping to grow healthy food for people. I wanted to do more in this industry, but I knew that I had to gain further education. We know moving to the city, for young regional people, is tough and expensive, and often, to the detriment of regional communities, it also means they and their new-found skills are lost to the big smoke. But, to my great fortune, the University of Melbourne agricultural campus is in a place called Dookie, only 30 kilometres outside of Shepparton, and I was able to complete an agricultural science degree in my own region.
          </p>
          <p>
           I worked in agriculture in the Goulburn Valley, as an agronomist, advising farmers on aspects of crop production, and I then worked for Israeli irrigation pioneers Netafim, helping farmers around

           use technology to apply water more efficiently to farms. At this time, I had the opportunity to be involved in the vibrant sports and arts communities in Shepparton. Music is the art form that sustains me, and my guitar will be a constant companion with me here in Canberra.
          </p>
          <p>
           I had the opportunity to further my education again by studying a Master of

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBA" rel="nofollow">
            MBA
           </a>
           offered invaluable insights into dealing with complex problems such as the relationship between people and the economy. In my view, an economy is there to serve people, and people will contribute successfully to businesses and the economy if they are made to feel valued and if they are able to use their own creativity to improve the performance of those businesses and that economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I had these opportunities for tertiary education in my region because La Trobe and Melbourne universities are committed to operating there, not just in capital cities. I want governments to continue supporting institutions who do this, because doing that is not just saying your postcode should not define your access to education; it is actually doing something to ensure it, and the Nationals have lived up to that in my region in recent times.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the past six years, I've had the opportunity to serve my community as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of the Committee for Greater Shepparton, an advocacy group funded and driven by the business community. In that capacity, I was able to gain knowledge of the issues facing many parts of our community, and I come to this place with that knowledge, in a spirit of collaboration, to find solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
           The electorate I represent covers some of the southernmost ranges of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divide" rel="nofollow">
            Great Divide
           </a>
           , in which are nestled the vibrant and burgeoning towns of Seymour and Broadford and the Puckapunyal army base. This is Taungurung country. In the central part of the electorate are the alluvial flatlands that span either side of the Goulburn River as it flows through the towns of Nagambie, Murchison and Toolamba. The Goulburn then junctions with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_River" rel="nofollow">
            Broken River
           </a>
           in Shepparton. Across the north of the electorate of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
            Murray River
           </a>
           towns of Yarrawonga, Cobram and Echuca and the agricultural centres of Kyabram, Rochester, Nathalia and Numurkah. The electorate is named after Sir Doug Nicholls, a Yorta Yorta man who grew up on the Cummeragunja mission, near Echuca. He was a sportsman, social worker, pastor,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Governor of South Australia
           </a>
           and respected elder in the community, and his is an inspirational example of service and leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
           The region is many things: home to a vibrant, sophisticated and evolving Indigenous culture; a critical food bowl of Australia, enabled by the Murray and Goulburn rivers, which supply a network of irrigation channels gravity-feeding water to farmland with highly fertile soils; and a major producer of apples, pears and peaches. It is a large producer of milk and a processor of this milk into high-quality dairy products that make their way around Australia and the world. If you are having a pizza somewhere in Australia or Asia, there is a good chance that the mozzarella cheese on it came from the Goulburn Valley.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition, the electorate of Nicholls is, I believe, one of the most successful examples of multiculturalism in the world. People from all over have made their way to this region, often coming with nothing, and they have made extraordinary lives. My observation as a member of this community is that we seem to do better when we celebrate each other's different cultural identity but moreover embrace each other's humanity, the humanity being a stronger bond between us than any divisions that tend to be amplified by race, gender, sexual orientation or religious view. As the Pink Floyd song 'Echoes' says:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Strangers passing in the street
          </p>

           By chance two separate glances meet
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           And I am you and what I see is me
          </p>
          <p>
           You will have noted the keyword I've used in this address is 'opportunity'. It was afforded to my grandparents thanks to regional industries, although in difficult circumstances. It was afforded to my parents in their access to tertiary education, which was only made possible because of the hard work and financial sacrifices of their parents. It has been afforded to me through a loving family with a focus on education, the mentoring from my community, access to tertiary educational opportunities in my region and the vibrant industry that sustains us.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am here because we need that opportunity to continue to be afforded to the people in regional Australia, the people of my electorate. How can we do this? Firstly and most importantly, the opportunity to work in agriculture and food processing in my patch comes through reliable and affordable water for irrigation. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has taken a significant amount of that water away from productive use in my electorate. The water is now owned by the Commonwealth to be used for the environment. I know it has caused a lot of pain. We understand the need to look after the river system, and strategic and efficient use of environmental water can help us do that. But we are at a tipping point and no more can be taken from communities that have already done much of the heavy lifting. When water leaves an area, so does the economy that that water creates. If a farmer sells a water licence back to the government, the farmer may well be compensated, but the milk or fruit that the farmer once grew grows no longer. The people in the supply chain that got the product to the consumer are no longer employed. The community, the region and, indeed, Australia are poorer in so many ways.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2012, there was a political add-on to the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan that said that 450 extra gigalitres on top of what was already taken could be taken away from productive use and sent downstream. But there is an important caveat in the legislation. It says it can only be taken if it would have a neutral or improved socioeconomic impact on basin communities. If any of this water was to be removed from irrigation in our region, the impact on our communities would be overwhelmingly negative. That's a no-brainer. In addition, any attempt to push that much water downstream could erode the banks of our rivers and cause negative environmental impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some try to argue that socioeconomic neutrality relates to the farmer being significantly compensated, so they say, 'We will just go and buy the 450 gigalitres back.' But my father, who has spent his working life analysing the wording in legislation, has always taught me that words matter and that in legislation all words must do some work and carry some weight. The meaning and weight of the term 'socioeconomic' is undeniable. 'Socio' means society. 'Economic' means economy. If the society and the economy in our basin communities would be negatively affected—and they would be—then the socioeconomic neutrality test fails. So no part of this extra water, this 450 gigalitres, can be removed from productive irrigation. If we do not have productive industries, opportunity for future generations will evaporate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Climate change is a complex challenge for our country. The overwhelming scientific opinion is that greenhouse gas emissions are causing a changing climate and that to prevent an average temperature rise that would lead to real challenges for humanity we as a planet need to reduce our emissions. The need to act is not in question. How we do it, without causing huge economic damage to our nation and its people, is the question. It is the how, not the if. Done in a reckless manner, with unrealistic timelines out of step with our global competitors, we could face a situation where industry moves emissions overseas. Australia's economic strength would be reduced but global emissions would not. It's a reality we need to face. I'm sure that as a nation we are up to this challenge, and I look forward to working constructively towards a just transition and keeping our mind open to the range of technologies that can get us there. In my mind, just transition means that the justice, human rights and dignity of those most affected by any change need to be protected, and often these are people in regional areas. We need to safeguard their opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
           I joined the National Party and asked the people of Nicholls to elect me as representative in this chamber because I believe in regional Australia and I want to see it thrive. Some of the great steps forward that we have made have been thanks to my predecessor,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Drum" rel="nofollow">
            Damian Drum
           </a>
           , as a member of the Nationals in government. We're on a better path than we once were. We have new cultural institutions, better transport, better tertiary education facilities and more opportunity for young people to have successful careers in our region, particularly in health care. That came from a real collaboration between Drummy and the community, along with the focus of the Nationals. I want to continue to develop our region and regional Australia more broadly.
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't want an Australia that's dominated by a few ever-expanding megacities. Let's look at the example of Germany. Germany has a population of 80 million, but its largest city has three million. Its structure is a network of vibrant smaller regional cities with strong industries linked by high-speed rail. Australia needs to approach this population balance question in a strategic way. I believe this happens by sustainably developing our regional cities, ensuring the towns that surround them are places that people want to move to, and creating the space and conditions for vibrant and profitable industries in the regions. We can link these places to capitals with high-speed electrified rail, and all of this can be powered by new technology with lower emissions. The spirit of these communities will be centred on creating opportunity for all.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to thank the volunteers who supported my campaign, especially the campaign committee, chaired by Lyndsay Dann. The only reason I'm in a position to do any of this work is because I married Lisa. Prior to meeting her, I was described as talented but wayward, a young man lacking in organisation, structure and direction. But thanks to Lisa's love, support and influence, I've been able to attain a position I could never have imagined. A lesson here is that all of us deserve the opportunity for love and partnership.
          </p>
          <p>
           My kids, Sophie and David, continue to provide inspiration, and I hope I can make them proud in this job, as we work towards ensuring that their generations, and the ones that follow, have better opportunities than we had.
          </p>
          <p>
           In closing: Richard and Eileen and Ray and Molly were born about 100 years ago in regional Australia. What future are we setting up for those born in the regions now? We owe it to them to invest, to innovate, to work hard and smart, to ensure opportunity is there for all, as we adapt to a changing future. So thank you all for the opportunity.

             Deputy Speaker, parliamentary colleagues, friends, family and everyone who is here today, I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal and the Ngambri people, whose land we meet on today, and paying my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. I would also like to acknowledge the Garigal people, as the traditional custodians of the lands of Mackellar, and thank them for protecting country and waters there since time immemorial.
            </p>
            <p>
             I stand before you today as the Independent member for Mackellar. To be here as the elected representative of the community that I love is indeed a deep honour and a privilege. But I stand here not for myself, not for a party, but as a voice for you, the people of Mackellar. I am just the fifth person to represent Mackellar since the seat was first established in 1949. I'd like to thank my recent predecessors Mr Jason Falinski and the Hon.

             for their years of dedication and service to our community. You may not know much about Mackellar or our vibrant, diverse and hardworking community, but the 150,000 people that call Mackellar home know we live in a special place. From the beautiful coastline that sweeps south from

             and Belrose, Mackellar is simply a stunning place. For thousands of years before us, Mackellar was home to the Garigal people, and throughout Mackellar you can still stumble upon the area's Indigenous history, through rock carvings, middens and paintings. Over 1,000 sites exist on the northern beaches today, an echo of a period long past but that must be remembered and honoured.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, it is not just the natural beauty or the proud Indigenous history that makes Mackellar a special place; it is the people and their spirit—the spirit of Mackellar. That spirit was embodied by our namesake,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Mackellar" rel="nofollow">
              Dorothea Mackellar

             </i>
             ,moves us still and whose daring and pioneering spirit led the way for women's rights. Mackellar is home to some of Australia's brightest entrepreneurs, hardworking families, a vibrant arts scene and incredible sporting talent. Mackellar is also diverse. Wonderfully, Mackellar has Australia's largest Tibetan community. It is this community spirit, the spirit of Mackellar, that rose during the election campaign to say 'Enough. We deserve to be heard. We want change.' It is that spirit I represent here in parliament today.

             The 2022 election was a watershed moment in our political history. The unprecedented wave of grassroots democracy has resulted in the largest-ever lower house crossbench. The parliament now has more women representing their communities than ever before. How did this wave of change happen? What was the secret? How does someone like me, a

              GP
             </a>
             never previously active in politics, overcome more than a century of party-dominated politics? The key—the power, I believe—was simply listening. Like my other crossbench colleagues, I listened to my community. During the campaign my team and I asked our community: 'What do you care about? What type of representative do you want? How can your MP help to improve your quality of life and how can we work together?' The results of this new type of politics, of putting people first and of listening first, were astounding. I had people in their 80s and 90s tell me that it was the first time in their lives they had ever voted differently. Young people came up to me in the street asking if they could hug me, letting me know how grateful they were that, instead of being treated condescendingly, someone was finally listening and promising to act—promising to put their future first. In 2022, listening to our communities was our strength. It transformed our community, and now I hope it can transform our future.

             Many people ask me how a GP got mixed up in politics. Well before my journey, I had watched in awe as the Independent movement swept across Indi and then Warringah. I was proud that professional women with no history in politics could take on the political establishment and win. That sense of pride grew when these women changed Australia for the better through their actions, their words and their integrity. In 2019, the election looming, I had my own lightning bolt moment. It came in the form of a 12-year-old boy, Mathias, a friend of my son. I had been troubled about the impact that climate change will have on the health and wellbeing of children and future generations for many years. On that day, my son and his friends were asking me about climate change, and I responded that, yes, one day they would need to act on it. Mathias looked up at me earnestly and said, 'Yes, because you adults have failed us.' He had a smile on his face. His comment found its target. I listened and I decided to act. As

             puts it so frequently, I realised that there was no cavalry coming over the hill to save us; there was only us. I had to do whatever I could to make a difference. If not you, then who? We've already been waiting two decades for action. However, I never imagined that my decision to act that day would end up with me standing here.

             in her first speech. Coming after her, I obviously need to try and outdo her, so I am quoting Gandalf:

            <p class="italic">
             It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

            <p>
             I urge you to join me and step out onto the road.

            <p>
             Stepping up as a candidate wasn't easy for me. I've always been pretty horrified by public speaking, for one thing. I also gave up being a GP, a job that I loved, and I knew this role would take me away from my children and family. But I am thankful that my past as an athlete trained me to step outside of my comfort zone. As I had done thousands of times before in my previous life, my earlier life, I put myself into the race. Thankfully, I did not stand up alone. A group of strong, everyday women stood up alongside me—Anyo Geddes, Leonie Scarlett,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
              Rebecca Clarke
             </a>
             , Maree Nutt and Patti Burton—women who'd had their own lightning bolt moments and decided to act. Together, we sat down with locals around the kitchen tables of Mackellar, and in the cafes and parks, and we listened.
            </p>
            <p>
             What did we learn? Time and again, climate change was the first issue people talked about, and that they were most desperate for the government to act on. We have been warned repeatedly by experts and scientists that climate change is the greatest threat to our environment, our health, our security and our economy, and that opening any more coal mines or gas mines is inconsistent with the Paris target and a liveable future. My question is: are we listening? Without a doubt, humans, however, respond to stories, not statistics. Recently I visited Lismore to hear people's stories of the floods from their own mouths. I can only think the courageous young woman who recounted her story for me, telling me how, without warning, in the middle of the night, cold, dark, swirling waters rose rapidly within inches of their ceiling. She told me of the hours-long struggle as she tried to keep herself, her mother and her dogs alive, of the warmth that started to spread throughout her body as hypothermia set in, of the people who held up their children, screaming for them to be rescued as an overloaded tinny took them to higher ground, and of her inability to work or simply take a bath since. The physical and mental scars from repeated extreme weather events will last for years to come. I ask you: are we listening? I believe that if we do listen, if we act, if we take the community with us, we can prevent the worst impacts of climate change and we can grasp the window of opportunity to lead the world in the clean technology revolution, but we must act now.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we listened over cups of tea, we also heard people's deep frustration at the all too frequent corruption in our politics. Australians do want a return to decency, accountability and integrity. They want to trust their representatives and have faith in their democracy. They want to have confidence that decisions are being made in their best interests, not vested interests. As we witness the rise of autocracy around the world, we understand how fragile democracy can be. Together we must work to keep our democracy strong. We must ensure that the institutions underpinning our democracy remain independent and well funded. We must ensure that political appointments to government agencies are independent and merit based and that this is enshrined in law.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trust is the glue that holds society together. Without trust, people lose faith in institutions and disengage from their democracy. Over the next three years I will be working hard with my colleagues to build transparency and accountability into our political processes so that our democracy will remain strong into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people of Mackellar also told us they want a strong economy and support for our local small-business community. During my time as a doctor, I've learnt that a strong economy supporting well-paid jobs and stability is the key driver of good health. A decent job gives people purpose and access to the fundamental determinants of health. A roof over someone's head is key to safety, security and prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
             We heard how difficult it is for many people to make ends meet right now. Despite Mackellar's beauty, there are pockets of disadvantage. Young people, young families and essential workers, many of them women, are being locked out of the housing market and so forced to move out of the area. Small-business owners, teachers, nurses, and many others are reeling from the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can build an economy where small business thrives, where people, no matter their postcode, can prosper, where owning a home is not a distant possibility for young people. We need to act on housing affordability. We need to act on the cost-of-living pressures we are facing. Investing in renewables and making electric vehicles affordable for everyday Australians will mean lower energy bills and lower everyday costs of living for families and small businesses. As the member for Mackellar, I will work to grow our economy and support local businesses and those who are doing it tough.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people of Mackellar also told us that they struggle to get the health and mental health care they need when they need it. Before becoming a GP, I worked as an emergency doctor at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Vale" rel="nofollow">
              Mona Vale
             </a>
             and other hospitals, so I know firsthand the importance of meeting our community's healthcare needs. Chronic disease, population growth, an ageing population, climate change and future pandemics will continue to strain our healthcare services. Now more than ever we must invest in our healthcare workforce and value their work.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
              The World Health Organization
             </a>
             has warned that climate change is the greatest threat to human health. It will strike the foundation of our health and wellbeing. In the Lismore region, for example, people are still living in tents. Crops and livestock were lost and local businesses destroyed. Housing security, food security and a stable income are the basis of health. We need to implement a national strategy for climate health and wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p>
             As your GP will tell you, prevention is better than cure. Acting now on the obesity epidemic will alleviate the burden of future chronic disease. Let's invest in primary health care and in prevention. Let's learn from this pandemic and plan for the next one.
            </p>
            <p>
             Youth mental health is also a pervasive concern for my community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tragically, the Mackellar community has grieved the loss of too many young lives through suicide. Every young life that is lost is utterly devastating. We must do better.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a GP, I know just how difficult it is for young people and their families to access the mental health services and support they need.
            </p>
            <p>
             Understanding the fear and the extreme stress of parents trying their hardest to keep their children safe without adequate support, I would give them my mobile number so they would always have someone to call. We must prioritise expanding mental health services.
            </p>
            <p>
             The neglect of our aged-care system was also exposed by the pandemic. Reform is urgent. We need to ensure older Australians receive the respect and quality of care they deserve, so this week I look forward to supporting the government's bill for 24-hour nursing care and a cap on administration costs.
            </p>
            <p>
             With the benefit of my experience in medicine and public health, I will use my role here to prioritise building health and aged-care systems that will meet the challenges of our time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have spoken a lot today about the power of simply being listened to, its empowering and healing effect. However, for too many years the voice of our

              First Nations
             </a>
             people has not been heard.
            </p>
            <p>
             They weren't listened to when their land was taken away.
            </p>
            <p>
             They weren't listened to when their children were taken away.
            </p>
            <p>
             They weren't listened to when their ancestors' bones were stolen and they weren't listened to when their culture was suppressed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Uluru Statement from the Heart, the First Nations Voice to parliament and the makarrata—truth telling—are all generous invitations for us to listen so that healing can begin. After more than 200 years I hope Australia is finally ready to listen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly I want to say to the youth of Australia, I am listening to you and I have your back.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do feel that as politicians we do have a duty of care towards you.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is your future we are creating, so you do deserve to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please indulge me as I round off with a few thank yous and tributes. You don't often get such an opportunity as this.

             I'm also deeply thankful to my husband and life partner, Adam Magro , for always believing in me and supporting me. Unfortunately, he is not here. He has COVID.

             To the 1,200-plus volunteers and the team that campaigned for change: we often spoke about the spirit of Mackellar during the campaign, and wow—didn't it shine brightly during those months? It showed in the glowing faces of the children smiling up at me; the teens wanting selfies; the honks from tradies; the hugs, the music that was played and the songs that were written; the dancing; the signs on the side of the streets; the expressions of deep gratitude from people who told me they felt hopeful for the first time in years. There were so many words of support. 'Feel the support, not the pressure,' I was told. We kept it positive, we kept it polite, we planned and we prepared. There was joy and there was such wonderful camaraderie. So many deep and lasting friendships and connections were made. It was an exhilarating ride, and it has only just begun.

             <p>
              It is my great honour to stand here as the elected representative for Corangamite for a second term. I thank the people of Corangamite for placing their faith in me, and I will work hard each and every day to honour that faith. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Australian people have voted for a change of government. As a passionate advocate for my community for many years, it is with a sense of relief that I am now part of a government that will get things done and will be more compassionate and more accountable. I am proud of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to addressing the big issues and making structural and policy changes to improve the lives of all Australians. We have major challenges ahead, but, by putting the wellbeing of people and the protection of our environment at the heart of all policy, we have a positive agenda for the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am particularly proud of the Albanese Labor government, which has, under the direction of my colleague the minister for industrial relations, introduced legislation to ensure all employees across Australia have access to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. As a government, we are determined to meet these big challenges.

              to introduce 10 days family violence leave across the Surf Coast municipality. We were the first council to do so—12 years ago. From little things big things grow, and now this fundamental and vital support has been embraced by councils and corporations across Australia. This legislation matters. It means people experiencing horrific and often hidden violence do not have to choose between keeping a job and a wage and fleeing family and domestic violence.
             </p>
             <p>
              I thank my constituents, the union movement and every person who has advocated for survivors of family violence for making this happen. In my role as member for Corangamite, I remain committed to representing the interests and concerns of my community. I have listened to my constituents, and they have told me that they care deeply about the big challenges we face: issues related to climate change, aged care,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
               NDIS

              , health care, integrity in government, quality education, reliable communications, and decent roads that connect us to work, to schools and to essential services.
             </p>
             <p>
              In my regional electorate, safe and reliable roads are essential; my constituents reminded me of it on a daily basis. This is why my government has committed $125 million to build the second stage of the Barwon Heads Road. This is a significant arterial link between the Bellarine and Geelong, in a rapidly growing part of my electorate. This critical piece of infrastructure will serve more than 60,000 residents in the next two decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              My region and the nation face rising cost of living pressures, low wage growth, the devastating impact of climate change and a skills shortage. We are determined to face these big challenges and to overcome them. We cannot waste a single day.
             </p>
             <p>
              Investing in health care is one of our most important investments. It will become easier for people in my electorate to see a doctor and receive care under Labor's policy to provide automatic Distribution Priority Area classification to regional centres like mine. This means that places in my electorate, like Torquay,

               Ocean Grove
              </a>
              and Bannockburn, will now have access to more doctors to employ in their clinics. This will ultimately help patients across my region to see a doctor for non-urgent care quicker and closer to home.
             </p>
             <p>
              Labor is also delivering at least 50 urgent care clinics across the country to take the pressure off our emergency departments, which are struggling at the moment. We recognise this and we will deliver these urgent care clinics. I'm proud to say that there will be one in Geelong. We have announced it, and it will serve our region. These clinics will make it easier for families to see a doctor or a nurse when they have an urgent but not life-threatening care need. These clinics will bulk-bill and ease cost of living pressures on families.
             </p>
             <p>
              Under the previous government, the cost of seeing a

              increased by 43 per cent in my region. Labor is investing almost $1 billion in primary care through the Strengthening Medicare Fund to deliver better access and care for patients. With our Strengthening Medicare GP Grants, we will invest $220 million in our local GP practices after almost 10 years of Liberal cuts and neglect. These grants will provide funding for GPs to help them do things like upgrade

              systems, upskill staff, purchase new equipment and upgrade ventilation and infection control, at a time when we know that COVID is still ever present. It's time we made health care accessible and affordable for everyone, and it's time we properly supported our healthcare professionals during what is one of the most challenging periods in our history.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd like to talk about child care now. In my electorate, we have many, many young families and lots of parents who rely on child care so they can get back to work. Labor's plan to make child care cheaper will help thousands of families in my region. No one should be penalised for taking on extra hours, extra days or a job. Cheaper child care will help mums and dads get ahead. Too many families are locked out of child care because it's just too expensive. Improving our child care system is a fundamental economic reform. Investing in child care will improve productivity and women's participation in the workforce, which will in turn help boost women's superannuation and reduce the gender pay gap.
             </p>
             <p>
              Under Labor, people will now get a fair go at work. Too many people are struggling on low wages, with poor working conditions. We can do so much better. We owe it to the Australian people to lift wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. We are part of the way there, with our increase in the minimum wage. We have committed to ensuring Australians have access to secure jobs, and we want decent wages and safe working conditions for all workers.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Uluru Statement from the Heart is something that I and my Labor colleagues are passionate about. The implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, through Voice, Treaty and Truth, is an opportunity for healing, truth-telling and closing the gap. This will be a defining moment in our history, and I'm proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government, which is taking real action to promote unity and healing by holding a voice to parliament referendum in this term of government. We will work in genuine partnership with

             <p>
              Climate change and energy is another major commitment of Labor. We brought it to the election, and I know my community is so proud that we have stepped up on this. We will take action on climate change, and we will invest in renewable energy. I can assure my community that I will be working very hard to ensure that any manufacturing opportunities in relation to renewables are grasped by the region.

              In my electorate, Labor will deliver on a community battery for the Sands Estate community in Torquay.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sands" rel="nofollow">
               The Sands
              </a>
              Owners Corporation worked hard over a long period of time to build a case for a community battery. They spoke to me frequently, talking about this important need. It was with great pride that, during the election campaign, I made a commitment towards this community battery. It will allow local households to feed solar power into the shared battery during the day and draw from it at night. This will cut electricity bills and reduce emissions and pressure on the grid, which we must upgrade. The Sands community aims to reach net zero by 2024. I applaud this community for its vision and commitment to reducing emissions. It perfectly illustrates Labor's Powering Australia plan, which has been backed by business and industry across the country and will help to cut power bills for thousands and thousands of families and businesses. I was particularly proud to make this announcement and am proud to see the project will begin soon and to work with them for its completion.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said earlier, families across the Bellarine will have quicker and safer commutes to work, school and weekend sport, thanks to the $125 million commitment the Labor Party made in the lead-up to the election. Now in government we will be able to deliver it, to build stage 2 of the Barwon Heads Road duplication. By 2031 the Barwon Heads Road will carry up to 44,000 cars and trucks every day. If we don't build for that traffic growth now, locals will be trapped in an ever-growing gridlock. I want to assure my community that I will be working hard to deliver this in a timely manner, because I know how challenging it can be for many who currently use that road.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am also proud of my election commitment of $20 million towards a 50-metre indoor pool in Drysdale on the Bellarine Peninsula. This is a growing region. People deserve to be well, in good health, and to be able to exercise and connect. This pool will deliver on that. I surveyed almost 2,000 residents on the Bellarine and they overwhelmingly told me that they want this indoor pool. I am working with the local and state governments to deliver this exciting commitment for the people of the Bellarine. I look forward to seeing this opened in the first term of our government.
             </p>
             <p>
              We pledged $6 million towards a regional high-ball sporting facility for the urban growth area of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_Creek" rel="nofollow">
               Armstrong Creek
              </a>
              . The high-ball facility will help address a lag in sporting and community infrastructure and provide an opportunity to host regional tournaments in basketball, netball and other outdoor ball sports. The
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
               Commonwealth Games
              </a>
              are also coming to the region. I look forward to working with our state government on any opportunities that arise. This high-ball centre will be a place for hundreds of local families. Kids, mums and dads will come together, meet each other and make friendships for years into the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another important commitment is a headspace for Armstrong Creek. Young people will finally have a dedicated service for early intervention mental health support. We committed $4.8 million to establish a full-service headspace centre in Armstrong Creek, which will also service the surrounding areas of Torquay,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Juc" rel="nofollow">

              , Grovedale and Marshall. The Albanese government will support young people and their families through their mental health challenges. We know from COVID-19 the everyday pressures and the demand for mental health support. It has surged across Australia and certainly in my region it has impacted young people. They have come to me and spoken about the need for better services. I will work with the community to deliver a headspace for Armstrong Creek.

              My electorate of Corangamite has one of the highest number of veterans in the state, with over 2,000 veterans and family members. In the Greater Geelong region there are around 3,500 veterans and family members. We must do better to support them. The Albanese government will invest in defence personnel and veterans on the Surf Coast and in the Geelong region by providing $5 million in funding for a new veterans wellbeing centre. The hub will be a one-stop shop for veterans and their families to access a range of services, including transition, wellbeing support, advocacy, employment, housing assistance and, importantly, social connection. I will soon be consulting with local stakeholders,

             <p>
              Over the past three years I have had a large number of environmentally active people from the region speak to me about the need to look at stormwater run-off. We have some of the most beautiful wetlands in Australia. The Karaaf wetlands in my region are currently facing decimation because the stormwater has not been treated well. The local council are very aware of how important these wetlands are, and I'll give them a shout-out for the work they're doing in that area. Before the last election we committed $1.9 million to looking at how we do better for these wetlands. I'm proud to say that, now in government, we can actually work on the Karaaf Wetlands restoration project, which is to the north of Torquay. The Karaaf Wetlands is 320 hectares of wild, open country, and it is hypersaline saltmarsh. It's also home to migratory waders from

               North Asia
              </a>
              and the endangered orange-bellied parrot. The Albanese government is committed to protecting our important waterways and wetlands, and I will be proud to work with the community and the council to make sure that we improve these wetlands, that they are saline and that the stormwater run-off is managed in a way that is responsible and environmentally sustainable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Community batteries: they are the way of the future. Our government is recognising that. They offer people in the community an opportunity to reduce our emissions, use renewable energy and reduce energy bills at a local and community level. I'm very proud that, under the Albanese Labor government, Torquay will soon be home to one of the first community batteries, as I mentioned earlier. Importantly, there will be more opportunities for local communities to embrace this innovation, and it's something I'll be encouraging my community to take up.
             </p>
             <p>
              I understand the importance of government financial support to local sporting and community clubs. These are grassroots organisations. They are the glue that binds us together. That's why my government is committed to a number of sporting and community upgrades across my electorate, including the Queenscliff Football Netball Club, the Leopold Memorial Recreation Reserve, the Portarlington Demons Football and Netball Club, the Torquay Tigers Football and Netball Club at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Creek" rel="nofollow">
               Spring Creek
              </a>
              , the Ocean Grove Memorial Recreation Reserve, Barwon Heads Football Netball Club and the Bannockburn Football Netball Club. These are all important organisations where people come together, where children play sport and where I've attended many, many times. It was a great pleasure to support these organisations, which are largely driven by volunteers.
             </p>
             <p>
              We're also funding an active youth space project in Inverleigh and an expanded childcare service at the Bannockburn Family Services Centre and addressing a mobile black spot in

              . Throughout my region, communications and mobile are, in many places, underdone. We need to do better, and I will be working with the Minister for Communications to ensure that my region is well connected and has reliable mobile services.

             <p>
              As a local member for Corangamite, I want to do my best for my constituents and for all Australians. Now in government, we will get down to work and deliver on our commitments and give all Australians a better future.

               Deputy Speaker Goodenough, congratulations on your appointment to the panel. Thank you to the people of Cooper, an incredibly progressive group of constituents. At the last ABC survey, or the one before the last ABC survey, my electorate of Cooper was named the most progressive in the country. I believe it's been pipped at the post by the good people of Wills, ably represented here by my friend Peter Khalil, the member for Wills. The people of Cooper have told me what they care about. They care about climate change; they care about refugees; they care about decent jobs and the cost of living; they care deeply about the troubled aged-care sector; they care about homelessness and, of course, decent public education, health care and Medicare; and, importantly, they care about integrity in politics.

               What a wonderful start to parliament we've had, with that welcome to country by Dr Aunty Matilda House-Williams and her son Paul reiterating the urgency around the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Last weekend at Garma we heard a wonderful speech from our Prime Minister, a speech that spoke of generosity and gracious acceptance of that offer. He spoke of manners, of this being a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk with our First Peoples, and said that, whilst acknowledging the atrocities of the past, we can create a better future—one we can look back on at the end of the day with pride.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the end of your life, you want to look back. You want to look back and think you made a difference for the better. We all try, of course, in our own way: raising our kids right, helping our neighbours, volunteering, being as good a person as we can. But, my goodness, here in this House we have been given a great opportunity, a privilege not afforded to everyone, to make a difference—to make a difference as a government for the ages, even beyond our mortal selves. It is Labor governments that do that.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Prime Minister has said his will be a government that leads with heart. I want to be here with him. I'm proud to be here with him and this government to do just that. The first day's legislative agenda did show what we mean. Changed standing orders to create family-friendly hours was one of the first pieces of legislation tabled in this House, responding to the Jenkins report in full. This place should be an exemplary workplace and set the standard.

              </p>
              <p>
               We're going to have a jobs and skills summit to make sure that we are prepared for the future, looking at insecure work, women's participation, all-ability-inclusive workforces and skills shortages. We will look seriously at the role of immigration for skilled workers as a pathway to permanency as well as improving productivity for this country. We will look to abolishing indefinite detention and getting rid of punitive temporary visas for people seeking asylum, making sure there are pathways to permanent residency and safe resettlement. Of course, as I mentioned, there is the Uluru Statement from the Heart.
