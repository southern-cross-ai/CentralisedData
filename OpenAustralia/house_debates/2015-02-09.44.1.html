        As most people would be aware, oil prices have fallen drastically over the last six months or so. We have seen the price of crude oil fall to below $50 a barrel, which obviously has meant across the country that petrol prices have fallen. I think petrol prices peaked in my community at around $1.50 a litre and they have fallen to around $1.20 today, which is saving the average motorist around $20 a week. This is obviously great news; however, I was concerned, as were many people in rural communities, that the price of petrol in regional communities was falling much slower than it was in the city.

        I wrote to the Chairman of the

        on 8 January airing this issue. I asked if he could look into it and act if there was collusion happening. He wrote back in early February to confirm that they are monitoring petrol prices on the

        . I do have good news. The differential between city prices and regional communities has narrowed and in some cases now they are on par. I want to alert you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and my community that I will be keeping a close watch on this to make sure that regional communities are paying very similar prices for petrol to their city cousins.
