        I would like today to pay a special tribute to hardworking community champions in the Korean community in Sydney, many of whom live and work in my electorate in Bennelong. Last weekend I had the pleasure of attending the Austral-Korean Cultural Foundation’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Art" rel="nofollow">
         Visual Art
        </a>
        and Essay Writing Competition that was held on the banks of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Cove_River" rel="nofollow">
         Lane Cove River
        </a>
        . It was an event that was exceptionally well organised by the foundation’s chair, Mr Phillip Min, and fellow foundation members. It was a lovely day and a beautiful setting and was clearly designed to bring out the muse among the contestants—the children and young teenagers who are keeping their Korean language skills alive and brushed up in Saturday morning classes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Byung-il Kim, President of the Korean Society of Sydney, was also there. Mr Kim is a passionate advocate for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Australians" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and I see him regularly at community events.
       </p>
       <p>
        This coming Saturday another champion of the Sydney Korean community, Agnes Shim, will host the annual Korean Women’s Day at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anthony" rel="nofollow">
         St Anthony
        </a>
        ’s Church Hall in Marsfield. Agnes is president of the Sydney Korean Women’s Association, which was founded in 2002. Its aim is to promote a better understanding of Australian society and to provide much-needed settlement services to the Korean community. Agnes and her right-hand woman, Sue Yeon, also provide information and referrals, family support, employment counselling and much-needed disability services to many members of the community. They also provide a variety of recreational programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the Sydney Korean Women’s Association is based on a commitment to social justice and to multiculturalism. As I told my Korean friends last Saturday, the concept of multiculturalism is fundamental to what I stand for and to my colleagues in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . We do not seek to debate it; we are proud supporters of the concept of multiculturalism. I have believed always that we must maintain a strong and vocal commitment to a harmonious society in which people care for their neighbours and a society that promotes understanding across the cultures. I thank these Korean community champions and others, like the wonderful Young Byun of the Christian Community Aid service in Eastwood, who not so long ago brought to parliament a group of vibrant Korean seniors. All of their work is greatly appreciated and I thank them for it.
