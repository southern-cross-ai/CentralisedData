        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm the referendum working group suggested to his chief of staff that the referendum be delayed to a date later than 14 October?

         No, I can't confirm that. I've met with the referendum working group on a number of occasions. We met for two days around the cabinet table, and every member of the referendum working group was completely committed to going forward. What we've done here is exactly what we said we would do, which was to have a referendum. Last year, I put forward a timetable that we stuck to, a timetable that said there would be a referendum in the last quarter of this year. I spoke on multiple occasions about it being at a time after the grand finals were held and after the parliament would vote for a referendum to be held, which the parliament did in June. Now, I'm not quite sure what way the member for Page voted in that legislation, but the Leader of the Opposition sat over here and voted for the referendum to go ahead.

           Under the legislation of how we hold a referendum, there is a time frame for when you can have it. You can't put it off and kick the can down the road forever.
          </p>
          <p>
           As well, during the period that that occurred, I noted that the Leader of the Opposition at one stage, having voted for what the referendum question would be, said that I could just change what the question is. That's what he said halfway through. And in October he was saying that we didn't ever say before the election that we'd have a referendum on the Voice.

             What I am not responsible for is, shall we say, the 'anything if it fits the convenience of a radio interview'. He will say anything at all, regardless of its relationship to the truth, such as the idea that we never mentioned before the election that we would hold a referendum on the Voice. We held a referendum on the Voice. The Australian people had their say. We respect that. We're getting on with the job of making a difference to Indigenous lives.
