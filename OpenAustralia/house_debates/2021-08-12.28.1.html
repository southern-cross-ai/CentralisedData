        Yesterday Melburnians heard the unwelcome news that the latest lockdown would be extended beyond this week. Unfortunately the fact that the delta variant of the COVID-19 virus is so infectious means that this seems to be the most sensible course of action, but that doesn't mean that it is any easier for businesses and households.

        Throughout this week, I have been speaking with as many Chisholm locals as I can, by phone and over Zoom. It's certainly tough out there, but there are positive stories too. For example, Greg, from Bodgo's Cafe in Blackburn, told me his weekday trade has been significantly affected by restrictions, but automatic support payments through our latest $400 million Business Support Package are helping him through. Meanwhile, Waverley Cinema has bagged a $60,000 grant through the Morrison government's SCREEN Fund. When I spoke with owner Brian, he told me this would support his business to at least Christmas. To Chisholm locals, I say this: I know this lockdown is absolutely gut wrenching, but we'll support you every step of the way.
