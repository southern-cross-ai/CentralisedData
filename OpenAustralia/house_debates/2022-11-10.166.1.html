        Inc., I wish to place on the parliamentary record my strong support for plans to redevelop the facility as a community hub which will be accessible to all residents. The hub will be built on the existing community base of more than 600 residents through a program of community activities and events including health and wellbeing programs, tennis, pickleball, fitness, tai chi and yoga. At a time when budget constraints make funding for community facilities extremely competitive, I have been working closely with members of the committee, including Phil Vinciullo, James Wild, John Ingrams, Larry Hirsch, and the state member for Hillarys, Caitlin Collins

        , to raise community awareness of the project, highlight the need for this facility in our community and pursue funding sources. I organised a petition which has collected over 1,000 signatures, demonstrating strong local support. The community hub concept has also received support from champion Wimbledon tennis player and Moore resident Matt Ebden.

        estate in Kallaroo was developed over 40 years ago. At the heart of the suburb is a small community facility built around a clubhouse, including tennis courts and catering for a thriving local community. The facility has long since outgrown its capacity, and the local residents association has advanced the proposal to extend and redevelop the ageing facilities to create a new not-for-profit community hub. Extensive research has been undertaken to ascertain community needs, culminating in a strategic plan for the next five years, including indicative building plans for the redevelopment of the existing facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community hub recently hosted the popular Markets by the Sea event, bringing market stalls to the community with a day full of entertainment which was well attended by hundreds of local families. A redeveloped North Shore community hub will be run by the community for the community. Together with strong support from funding commitments from both the City of Joondalup and the WA state government, a funding contribution from the federal government of $3 million is necessary to make this landmark project a reality. The North Shore community hub redevelopment has significant merit. I wish to formally place on record my strong support for this project. I have written to the Minister for Sport on behalf of the residents association to progress this initiative in the budget process.
