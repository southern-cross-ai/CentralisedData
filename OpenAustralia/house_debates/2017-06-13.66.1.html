        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy, representing the Minister for Education and Training. Will the minister inform the House how the government's needs based funding model will provide funding growth for schools in my electorate of Canning? Is the minister aware of expert support for the Australian Education Amendment Bill?

          I thank the member for Canning for his question and acknowledge his deep commitment to the Turnbull government's extra funding for schools throughout his own electorate and across the country—$18.6 billion in additional funding, a 75 per cent increase. Nine thousand plus schools will benefit.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the seat of Canning there are 23,000 school students in 53 different schools, and, as a result of the Turnbull government's plan, there will be $1.5 billion worth of school funding for those schools in the electorate of Canning—37 government schools, nine independent schools and seven Catholic schools. There is Pinjarra Primary School, with 620 students, which will get a $6.2 million increase. There is St Joseph's Primary School, with 130 students, which will get a $3.6 million increase. Across

          </a>
          , under one of Labor's 27 secret dodgy deals, the school students of Western Australia got the worst possible deal across Australia when it came to the schooling resource standard. They got only 14 per cent, but under the Turnbull government they will get 20 per cent.

           <p>
            I was asked if there were any other views of particular note. Today, Dr Ken Boston, one of the original members of the Gonski panel, a former head of the education departments of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia

            , said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There are no grounds for opposition to the schools funding bill in principle, and every reason to work collaboratively towards its successful implementation and further refinement in the years ahead.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It will be a tragedy if the school funding bill is voted down in the Senate.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, ultimately, it is up to the Leader of the Opposition. He is standing alone in opposition to an additional $18.6 billion in funding. He is showing why his former dictum, his famous line, 'If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there,' is starting to work, because he does not know where he is going. If he were supportive of more school student funding, if he were in favour of a more transparent and fair system, he would get behind the Turnbull government's education plan, with an extra $18.6 billion for more than 9,000 schools across the country.
