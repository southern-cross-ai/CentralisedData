       <p>
        I rise today with a heavy heart to speak on the tragic and sudden passing of Councillor Nicola Davis from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Whittlesea" rel="nofollow">
         City of Whittlesea
        </a>
        . As the federal member I think it is appropriate that I say some words about Councillor Davis in this place, Australia's parliament, to mark an extraordinary contribution in a short period of time. I hope today to pay tribute to Nicola's remarkable record of service to the people of Whittlesea and, as best as I can, to the extraordinary person that she was.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the community a few weeks ago we saw hundreds of people gather together to celebrate Nicola's life and we heard a beautiful eulogy from her friend Councillor Rex Griffin. I hope to emulate that in my small way over the next few minutes. Nicola Davis was elected as a councillor for the City of Whittlesea in November 2012 representing the north ward, one of five new councillors elected at the 2012 local government elections. Nicola was born in the United Kingdom and also lived in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        before moving to Australia with her husband, Paul, in 2005. Together with Paul, Nicola ran the Bike n Bean bike shop in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Morang" rel="nofollow">
         South Morang
        </a>
        . The Bike n Bean provided a demonstration of Nicola's passions for cycling, for people and for great coffee and of her independent streak more generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the moment I first encountered Nicola I was struck by her passion for life, particularly for her young family and her community, and by her energy, her decency and her warmth, which gave so much to so many. This was a common and lasting impression that Nicola made on people. It is little wonder that she was able to secure election to council as a relative unknown in her first attempt, and once on council she wasted no time in finding ways to serve her community. She represented the City of Whittlesea on the following groups: the Australian Local Government Women's Association; the City of Whittlesea Arts, Cultural and Sporting Grants Program for Young People; the Darebin Creek Management Committee; the Sustainability Programs Advisory Committee; and the Whittlesea and Plenty Valley Tourism Association. This wide array of involvement offers an insight into Nicola's broad interest in issues of gender equity, in opportunities for young people, in small business and in the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nicola also valued the cultural diversity in the city and would often bring her two young children with her to events so that they too could gain an understanding of, and empathy for, diverse communities. My own son, Daniel, regularly benefited from the company of her beautiful daughters at events. I think back in particular to seeing Nicola in happier times at Meadowglen last year.

        of the City of Whittlesea, described Nicola as conscientious, considerate and caring yet still prepared to speak up on issues she believed in, but always with great respect for others' opinions and feelings. He said that Nicola worked closely with many staff across the organisation to ensure the best outcome for the community. Staff who had the privilege of working with Nicola have commented to me that they found the experience very rewarding. As both a councillor and a colleague Nicola will be sorely missed. Nicola's fellow councillor, Kris Pavlidis, described Nicola as someone who shone through with integrity and high intellect. She said: 'Nicola chose public life for all the right reasons. She was an excellent public representative and was often the voice of reason on council. I've learnt from her, and will ensure her legacy lives on.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Nicola chose public life for all the right reasons. She was an excellent public representative for her constituency and was often the voice of reason on council. I will conclude with Paul Davis's remarks:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nicola had packed so much into her 35 years much more than most people do in a lifetime. She brought light and laughter into all of our lives, we are going to miss her deeply. Nicola you will always be in our hearts, we love you so much. Now rest in peace.
