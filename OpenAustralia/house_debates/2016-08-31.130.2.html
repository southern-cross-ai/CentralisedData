        <p>
         It was in this chamber I experienced one of the most remarkable moments of my life. I was in that gallery just up there. It feels like it was just yesterday. But I will tell you that story of truth-telling and generosity in a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ballumb Ambul Ngunawhal Ngambri yindamarra. Ngadu bang marang Ngadhu Ngu-nha winhanga nha nulabang nguwandang. Ngadhu biyap yuganha. Birrang a ngawaal. Ngadhu, yand yaman gid yal. Yindyamarra. Mandaang. Ngarind-ja.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have just said, in the language of Wiradjuri, my people: 'I pay respect to the ancient Ngunawhal and Ngambri. I say this: good day. I am giving my first speech and I am deeply moved. I have journeyed to another place—a powerful place. I am one person. I wish in this House to honour, to be respectful, to be gentle and to be polite. I am thankful, happy. I could weep.' However, I say to my elders and to you, Mr Speaker, that that last bit may not always apply in question time!
        </p>
        <p>
         I mention respectfully the traditional owners of the seat of Barton—three clans of the Eora, the Bidjigal, the Gweagal and the Badigal, custodians of the land from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooks_River" rel="nofollow">
          Cooks River
         </a>
         to the shores of Brighton-Le-Sands and out to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_River" rel="nofollow">
          Georges River
         </a>
         . It is strong country. And to the traditional owners of all the lands from which members of this chamber and the other place come: these lands are, always were and always will be Aboriginal land—sovereignty never ceded.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, what was that remarkable moment? Many of you were here. It was the first sitting of the new Labor government, on 13 February 2008.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         was the new Prime Minister,

          Jenny Macklin
         </a>
         the minister for Indigenous affairs, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
          Brendan Nelson
         </a>
         the opposition leader.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our nation had been holding its breath for a long time, waiting for three words: 'We are sorry.' There was the stubborn refusal of the previous Prime Minister to apologise for policies which had ripped many thousands of Aboriginal children from their family, culture and country—the devastating effects still felt today. But around the perimeter of this chamber sat some of those children, now old people, still wearing the scars of forced removal on their faces. They were joined by all surviving prime ministers bar one.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, as the words rang out across this chamber, across this land and around the world, 'For this we are sorry,' the country cried and began to breathe again.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the speeches concluded, two women stood and handed the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and minister an empty coolamon—and I beg the indulgence of the House in carrying a coolamon in here today. It was the most gracious and generous thing I had ever seen. It was profound, a gesture that made us all better people. Friends, a coolamon is what we carried our babies in, which is what made it such an amazing, generous thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         I carry this empty coolamon into this place today as a reminder of that moment, of the power we exercise in this building today, and that it must be for the good of all. It must be gracious. But it has not always been so. But it can be. That day the truth was told in this place, and the power of generosity was writ large. So, Mr Speaker, the significance of coming down from that gallery up there to the floor of this chamber is not lost on me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Members, in this term of parliament all I want is to be able to stand in this place knowing that the document on which it was founded finally tells the truth. Recognition of the First People in our nation's constitution is the next step on the path we are walking towards a country that can look itself in the eye knowing that we have come of age. Fundamentally, reconciliation is about three things: it is about reciprocity; it is about restitution; and it is about truth telling. One of the bravest statements I ever heard was in the opening ceremony of the 1997 Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne. The 10-point plan in the winding back of the native title debate was raging, and the chair of the council at that time is now Senator Patrick Dodson. I was on the executive committee—I am not sure if Patrick liked it or did not—but I think I did okay and I think he did like it. He was an amazing chair. But Senator Dodson said at the opening of that convention, in the presence of the world media, 'There can never be reconciliation without social justice.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Nor is the significance of a first speech lost on me. It is defining; it sets out what has made you, what you believe in and what you stand for. It talks about the seat and the people whose hopes, hurts, aspirations and loves you carry into this place. It talks of the deep affection you have for those people. Because of the significance, I carry into this chamber this cloak. This cloak was made by my Wiradjuri sister, Lynette Riley, who will sing us into this place now.
        </p>

         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, Lynette.
        </p>
        <p>
         This cloak tells my story. It charts my life. On it is my clan totem, the goanna, and my personal totem, the white cockatoo—a messenger bird and very noisy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me share with you a little of what has made me. In 2010 I returned to the little town I grew up in. It is called Whitton—I am a freshwater kid from the Riverina. I learnt to swim in irrigation channels, and we shared that water with yabbies, freshwater mussels, leeches, red bellied blacks and I suspect considerable amounts of chemicals, which explains the constant boils and hives I had as a child.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was the 150th anniversary of the Whitton public school; I was a cabinet minister at the time and I thought I looked pretty flash. A man a little older than me—I guess he would have been one of the big kids when I was at school—said to me, 'You know, Linda, the day you were born was one of the darkest days this town has ever seen.' I was so shocked I could not respond. You see, Mr Speaker, despite being more than 50 years on, I was born at a time when a white woman having an Aboriginal baby was shocking—and doubly so if that woman was not married. I was born at a time when the Australian government knew how many sheep there were but not how many Aboriginal people. I was 10 years old before the '67 referendum fixed that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first decade of my life was spent as a noncitizen. I was raised by two very brave people who no doubt were made to pay for the bravery and generosity they displayed—my great aunt Letitia Laing, Nina, and her brother Billy. They were of Scottish heritage and in the latter part of their life. I have wondered often had they not stepped up to raise me where my life would be now.
        </p>
        <p>
         I loved them very much and experienced their passing and grief early in life. I was taken in after their death by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Coral Smith
         </a>
         and her family. Coral's daughter Barbara is my oldest friend on earth, 51 years! I spoke to her on the weekend. Friendships over one's whole life are rare things, indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I didn't meet my Wiradjuri father until I was in 28—his first words to me were, 'I hope I don't disappoint you.' His name was Nonni Ingram, Lawrence Ingram, of the great Wiradjuri Ingram clan. Nonni and his wonderful wife Launa had 10 children. Ten brothers and sisters I didn't know existed! We grew up 40 minutes apart. The power of racism and exclusion were not things you could see, but you certainly felt them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had two sets of brothers and sisters—my mother married a man, a wonderful man, called Fred Stracke. They had four children, two brothers gone now, but my sister Kim is here today. I'm so thrilled you are here, Kim; it means a lot. Fred spent his life serving in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and served in World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I would ask all of those listening this afternoon to imagine what it was like for a 13-year-old Aboriginal girl in a school classroom, being taught that her ancestors were the closest thing to stone age man on earth and struggling with your identity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Being in this chamber today feels a long way from that time. And from the man in the schoolyard at the anniversary—well, here's to you mate.
        </p>
        <p>
         In many ways these experiences have been the catalyst for my subsequent life as an advocate for education and social justice. The Aboriginal part of my story is important. It is the core of who I am, but I will not be stereotyped and I will not be pigeonholed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me tell you a little of the Wiradjuri story. In Wiradjuri lore Biami is the creation spirit. He is the source of both our physical and moral landscape. The story of invasion and conquest for the Wiradjuri is a brutal one. The deadly art of poisoning waterholes and flour began in Wiradjuri country. Massacre sites are dotted all over my lands. The scars are evident for all of us to see. In 1823 martial law was declared in Bathurst after Windradyne and his warriors waged a fierce war of resistance. Four months later over 1,00 Wiradjuri were dead by sanctioned murder. In 1842, during the second Wiradjuri wars, one horror saw all but one young boy slaughtered when settlers opened fire on a group taking shelter on an island amongst the reeds in the creek of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrumbidgee_River" rel="nofollow">
          Murrumbidgee River
         </a>
         . That creek is now known as Poisoned Waterhole Creek, and their sheltering place is called Murdering Island. On Saturday I drove over that bridge and that creek. I stopped the car, I got out and my blood ran cold. You see, Mr Speaker, I am of the Murrumbidya Wiradjuri.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Barton, from the beach in Brighton-Le-Sands you can stand and look towards
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Botany Bay
         </a>
         where the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet" rel="nofollow">
          First Fleet
         </a>
         in 1788 first entered these shores. Settlement or invasion is a matter of perspective—of whether you were on the shore or on the boats in the middle of the bay. I spoke earlier of truth-telling. Perhaps another great act of honesty and healing would be a permanent remembering of those frontier wars, just down the road at our national war memorial.
        </p>
        <p>
         The chamber I have come from in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         proudly hangs the Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Island
         </a>
         er flags. Symbolism is important. I know that symmetry is important in this place, but perhaps we could think that once we get constitutional recognition we could add another two flags to this chamber, coloured red, gold and black, and white, green and blue—the colours and the flags of the two first peoples of this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will say that I intend to bring the fighting Wiradjuri spirit into this place. This mob behind me knows what that is about. I will bring that spirit into this place for the people of Barton, for the first peoples and for those great Labor values of social justice and equality for all people.
        </p>
        <p>
         I enter this place as a representative of the people of Barton, a community I have been proud to live in for almost 20 years. If there is a god of demography, it is one of his greatest ironies that the seat named after the architect of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          White Australia
         </a>
         policy has become one of the most multicultural in the country! Over half of the people in Barton were born overseas. Almost 10 per cent were born in China. We have a well-establish post-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
          World War II
         </a>
         Greek and European community, a thriving Arabic-speaking community, a rapidly-growing Nepalese community, a Macedonian community, an Indian community—you name it. We have people from every corner of the globe. Barton is a kaleidoscope of languages, ethnicities and cultures. I am not sure what
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Edmund" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Edmund
         </a>
         would think of the ethnic wonderland being represented in this place today by, of all people, me—and a Koori woman to boot!
        </p>
        <p>
         From Campsie to Kyeemagh and from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley_Hills" rel="nofollow">
          Beverley Hills
         </a>
         to Brighton, this electorate could not be a more shining example of what our modern Australia looks like. For the benefit of those in this House and in the other place who doubt it, I want to place here on record that we are a stronger community because of this diversity. We are better for our differences and we are richer for all the broader cultural experience that it affords us. It is the underpinning of small business in the Barton electorate by the people I refer to.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all have fantastic stories from election day, but let me share one with the House. It is Hurstville Public School at 5.45. It is dark and it is cold. The booth is being packed up and a car pulls up. There is a very old woman in that car. She needs help to walk. It is a long way across that cold, dark playground. Her daughter says, 'Mum, don't worry, we can just pay the fine.' This old woman says, 'No, I'm voting. This is history.' Friends, it is history indeed. That, my friends, is Barton, and we made history together.
        </p>
        <p>
         Barton is the endless generosity of Khalil and his family at Ibrahim's Pastry in Rockdale and the tireless advocacy of James Zhou, Lily and little Chloe for their
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Chinese Australian
         </a>
         community. It is the enthusiasm of Harry Danalis and Nia Kateris for their
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
          Greek Orthodox
         </a>
         community across the region and the passion of families like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Awada" rel="nofollow">
          Joe Awada
         </a>
         and our proud Arabic community. Those are just some of the stories; there are so many more.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, for my money there is only one division that counts for anything in our electorate. It is the one between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Bulldogs" rel="nofollow">
          Canterbury Bulldogs
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George_Dragons" rel="nofollow">
          St George Dragons
         </a>
         . My office and I are already preparing a public response should both teams play in the grand final next year. I have already told my grim-faced media advisor that I will remain a Doggies fan, but a true friend of the Red Vs. Truly though, both teams have a long and proud history in Barton. And like all good local sporting clubs, of which there are many, they are not just something to barrack behind. There are teams like Denis Loether's City Suns in Rockdale and Nick's Cooks River Titans. These are the clubs that glue a community together.
        </p>
        <p>
         And Barton, after a brief flirt with the Liberals, is firmly back in the Labor fold by 8.3 per cent because people in our community know that the invisible hand of the market cares little for the needs of the most disadvantaged. They recognise that a government's job is to ensure services are provided, whether they are education, health care or social assistance. Government cannot simply outsource its responsibility. Rhetoric about the evils of government intervention mean nothing to a mother in Campsie escaping domestic violence and searching for a bed that night. As a school teacher, as a member of the Anti-Discrimination Board of New South Wales, as a director-general, as a representative in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         of the first peoples, as a local member, as a minister responsible for children at risk, as a minister responsible for women, I have seen why government intervention is necessary. We cannot sit on our hands in places like these hoping that it will be so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Government has a role to serve and to lead. Throughout my political career, and before, I have been consistent. Much work of government is important but nothing more so than education. Education is not a silver bullet but it is the closest thing we have for dealing with our social ills. But our parliament must commit to more specific goals, too, with things like lifting the birth weight of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children. An increase of 191 grams could change lives. Reducing the rate of juvenile incarceration must be a priority, because we cannot be satisfied that this is a fair country while so many of our young people, many of them Aboriginal, are locked up. The royal commission has been announced, but I suspect it will be difficult to restrict it to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . I think we are already seeing that. There is no justification for the incarceration of children as young as 10, not when we know that getting kids to school and intervening early work so much more effectively and they are better economics.
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenge of domestic violence in our communities is a national crisis. Strong rhetoric must be matched with strong action and leadership. We should take seriously our custodianship of land, and I know that we do. We cannot leave this task somehow to the never-never with our children. Landcare groups in Barton like the Mudcrabs and the Cooks River Valley Association know this all too well.
        </p>
        <p>
         On issues of political debate and policy the message from those in our electorate, and outside it, has been clear. People have decried what they see as a lack of sincerity and a lack of good faith in our political conversation. They see it when some members of this parliament rally behind their right to hate speech but say nothing of the effect this will have on our most marginalised communities. Too often these calls to amend the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Racial Discrimination Act
         </a>
         come from those for whom this kind of discrimination it totally alien. I can tell them that it is hurtful. To me and to many people here today in the galleries in this chamber it is not alien. People do not ask for much from us. They want to be heard and they want to be treated with respect and with empathy. These are Labor values, and ones I will be proud to carry into this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, Mr Speaker, why Labor? Well, my story speaks for itself. I was raised by a boundary rider, a drover and a field hand, shaped by a combination of love and adversity, politically blooded in the Aboriginal rights movement, and embraced by the strength of Labor and the labour movement. There was never a question of being anything else!
        </p>
        <p>
         Now to some final reflections and thankyous. I have been in public life for some time, but I have to admit that with the frenetic pace of a local campaign I did not contemplate the response that the election of the first Aboriginal woman to the House of Representatives would get. I have been overwhelmed. I have received countless letters, emails and calls, all heartfelt and generous, some of which contained very flattering words about me as a role model. If this is true, it is possible thanks only to the role models who guided me and allowed me to come into this place, resting on their shoulders. In truth, I come to this place not only through my own labour. I have travelled paths blazed by those before me, resting on the shoulders of so many around me.
        </p>
        <p>
         So to the impossible task of recognising those shoulders I have leaned on and to thank those who have come on this journey with me. In my valedictory speech I named some very close personal friends. Many of them are in the gallery today. To those trusted friends—you know who you are—many of you have travelled from interstate to be here, including Charmaine and Rhonda. You have stuck by me and held me up through the best and the worst of times. Each of you has been a gift and I hope my love for you in return has been the same. I am touched by a number of my former colleagues from the New South Wales parliament who have joined me here this afternoon and others who have sent their good wishes, including our local representatives Chris Minns, his wife Anna, Steve Kamper and his wife Magda, as well as

         and her family, whom I see in the gallery today—they are the best little young campaigners you have ever seen—and, of course, Shaoquette Moselmane and the people Shaoquette works with so closely in the Arabic community. There are other state MPs whose support has been invaluable. I see

To the supporters in our community like Peter and Elizabeth Antonopoulos and Bill Mougios, I thank you. The fact is that I cannot name everyone. But to all of you: your help, the early mornings—and let there never be another winter campaign—and your hard work were appreciated.

         To the people of Barton: you have put your faith in me, and I will not let you down. When I entered state politics all those years ago I made two promises to those who had elected me—that I would always work hard and that I would always do my best. Today, in this chamber, I make those same promises again to the people of Barton, to my party, to my colleagues in this place and to the people of Australia.

         I spoke earlier of what it was like to be a young Aboriginal girl in the 1960s, sitting in a classroom and being told that my capacity was limited by my race and that my potential was capped by expectation. Thanks to voters in Barton I hope that there are young people who sit in classrooms—like Chloe Noak from my home town of Leeton, who is here today—whose imaginations are not so limited.

        <p>
         I would like to think of the electorate today as a bit like that crowd. Thanks to them, there are more Aboriginal voices in this place than ever before: Bonner, Ridgeway, Wyatt, Lindgren, Lambie, Dodson,

          <p>
           Mr Speaker, may I congratulate you on your recent election to the high office which you hold.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to commence by acknowledging and paying my respects to our first Australians, and their elders, past and present, on whose land we meet here today, just as I acknowledge our first Australians in my home on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Sunshine Coast
           </a>
           . The lot of our Indigenous peoples has been racked with poverty, ill-health and lack of opportunity since European settlement. I would like to acknowledge my predecessor
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Brough" rel="nofollow">
            Mal Brough
           </a>
           for the hard work he has performed in this place for our Indigenous peoples. But of course our work is far from done in achieving some semblance of equality. We can and we must do much better.
          </p>
          <p>
           With humility and respect, I thank the people of Fisher for giving me this privilege to represent them in this great place, a place that is the cornerstone of one of the oldest democratic systems in the modern world. I commit myself and my hardworking small team to working tirelessly for the people of Fisher: the young and old, the black and white, the employed, the small-business person, the pensioner, the self-funded retiree, the unemployed and the under-employed. I hope and pray that, with the forbearance of the people of Fisher and the wisdom and discernment only afforded to me by my
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">
            Lord Jesus Christ
           </a>
           , I may fulfil the role as their federal member with integrity, honour and respect.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is testament to our Australian egalitarian way of life that a once-carpenter and the son of a motor mechanic and fabric importer can come to serve the community in this place. In Australia, there are no class structures; there are no hereditary entitlements to sit in this place; there are business people, farmers, bankers, tradesmen, unionists and labourers, among many others, who are privileged to take their seats in this chamber. That is a privilege I hope I will never take for granted during the time that the people of Fisher trust me to represent them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The importance of the family unit is paramount in our community. The concept of the family unit is one which continues to evolve. Whether one lives in what is known as a traditional family unit or something else, we all came from a family of some description. My extended family, all of whom are here today, formed the bedrock of my belief system.
          </p>
          <p>
           I grew up in Melbourne, the son of Ian and Fay Wallace, the youngest of four children. My siblings, Mark, Lyn and Ian, together with my parents, formed a close-knit family unit, growing up between the fifties and the eighties with strong Catholic values. We learned from a very young age the importance of the love of our grandparents, Jerry and Kath Wallace, on whose farm at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hill" rel="nofollow">
            Red Hill
           </a>
           we spent our weekends; and Norm and Ethel Williams, with whom we had such a loving and close relationship. Through our parents, our grandparents taught us many things, such as the importance of hard work and self-reliance; self-sacrifice in defence of our nation; a healthy suspicion of banks, insurance companies and anyone from the government purporting to offer help.
          </p>
          <p>
           This nation owes a debt of gratitude to the generations of Australians who came before us. To those Australians of my parents' vintage and those of my grandparents' and older, I say thank you. Thank you for your service to our country in times of war. Thank you for your self-sacrifice in times of severe depression. Thank you for your grit and determination in times of adversity—that never-say-die, that 'you wouldn't be dead for quids' approach to life has forged the Aussie spirit in ways that sometimes in our modern world appear to have gone the way of the box brownie camera.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am also greatly blessed to have the unceasing love and support of my wife, Leonie, and our four daughters: Emma, Caroline, Rebecca and Sarah, all of whom have made the journey to Canberra today from far and wide. Over the past 27 years of marriage, as a family we have stuck together, through thick and thin, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is rare these days that I get the opportunity to have my girls as a captive audience, so I will seize this opportunity to remind them of their forebears' courage, determination and selflessness. In fact, we all need reminding from time to time that the freedoms we enjoy today were hard-fought, forged not just on battlefields around the world over the past 115 years, but waged at ballot boxes and argued in courts around this great nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The greatest enemy of this nation today is not a sovereign state or a political ideology. Our greatest enemy is our own apathy. I fear that our positive yet relaxed she'll-be-right-mate approach has descended into an apathetic approach of, 'Who the hell cares! It's not my problem.' There is perhaps no greater example of this than our attitude to the nation's finances. As our great nation travels further and further down the road to financial ruin, we in this place all owe it to our children and our children's children to repair the nation's economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whilst we will all have differing views on how to rectify the economy, no one person and no one party has a restrictive licence on how best to achieve that rectification. In times of war, this country's political representatives have proven that we can set aside our partisan political views and work for the betterment of our nation. In this 45th
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
            Commonwealth Parliament
           </a>
           , we in this place must work together to ensure our future prosperity for our kids and our communities. Just as any family or business, from time to time, must pull in their belts, as a nation we must now do likewise, and we in this place must lead by example.
          </p>
          <p>
           The privilege that has been bestowed upon me by the people of Fisher would not have been possible but for the support of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Liberal National Party
           </a>
           and its members in Fisher. Upon winning preselection on 17 April, my team of tireless volunteers again swung into action. They swung into campaign mode only three weeks before the general election was called. It was a frantic time, but one that was very ably led by the professionalism and experience of my campaign manager, Elizabeth Worthington, who I should like to point out was bestowed with an honorary life membership of the

           </a>
           just last weekend. Thank you to all those who supported the campaign, many of whom have come down to Canberra today; others are watching this in my electorate office and in their homes back in Fisher. Our long days and sleepless nights were rewarded by the people of Fisher, and it is now up to me and my team to demonstrate that that faith was well founded.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to thank the LNP candidates in the preselection process for their dignity and their professionalism. The people of Fisher, both within and outside of the LNP, have demonstrated to the rest of the country that preselection and general election campaigns can be fought as a battle of ideas and policies, not an outright affront on the person espousing them. To put it in a football context for all those concerned in the election for Fisher: all candidates played the ball not the person. That seemed to resonate with our community.
          </p>
          <p>
           It would be remiss of me if I did not make mention of my parliamentary colleagues who assisted me in the campaign: the Prime Minister; the foreign minister; the Attorney-General; the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection; the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science; the Minister for Regional Development and then Minister for

           and Lindgren. I thank each of the honourable members and senators for their contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
           This long list of senior government ministers, senators and members demonstrates just how greatly valued the seat of Fisher is to the coalition. I would like to acknowledge the members for Fairfax and

           and the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Senator McGrath. We worked together as a team during the campaign. We presented a united front to the people of the Sunshine Coast, who see this period as a time for regeneration and growth. We ought to ensure that with all decisions we make as a small group representing the needs of the Sunshine Coast that we always put the needs of our constituents ahead of our own. With everything we do, we should first ask ourselves this simple question: will the outcome of this decision lead to a stronger economy and the creation of jobs for people living on the Sunshine Coast? Without a strong economy, without meaningful employment, our standard of living will axiomatically deteriorate.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would also like to acknowledge my state parliamentary LNP colleagues

           The seat of Fisher is situated to the south of the magnificent Sunshine Coast. At its southern boundary lies the township of Beerburrum. It extends to my home town of Alexandra Headlands in the north and out west as far as Cambroon. By city standards, it is a large electorate, taking in some 1,170 square kilometres. By country standards, when compared to the electorate of my friend the member for Maranoa, it is but the size of a postage stamp!
          </p>
          <p>
           When Leoni and I moved to the seat of Fisher 23 years ago with our then only daughter, Emma, we were moved by its natural beauty of clear, pristine waterways, its famous surf beaches, its beautiful bush and the magnificent

           . The Sunshine Coast has so much to offer the young and old alike. That is why it is Australia's 10th-largest city. With that population, however, comes a responsibility to ensure that our environment is maintained and protected for future generations.
          </p>

           Fisher's greatest asset is not, however, its landmarks, its surfing beaches or its picturesque towns up on the

           , the footy clubs and the bowls clubs throughout the entire electorate. Without these volunteers and many more like them, our community would be a cold, self-infatuated collection of individuals. I am proud to stand here as a member of the government that supports volunteers.

           The Sunshine Coast is the small business capital of the nation. The entrepreneurial spirit of those who reside in Fisher is indefatigable. Without any single large form of industry on the Sunshine Coast, the people of Fisher have learned that there is no-one better to plan for their prosperity than themselves. Take, for example, Steve and Rhonda Budden from Australian Off Road. They started their business 16 years ago in Maleny in their carport, and today they employ over 80 locals constructing top-quality off-road caravans in Caloundra. They understand the importance of manufacturing to our local economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fisher is growing and maturing as a region. Take, for example, the University of the Sunshine Coast, which plans to have 20,000 students enrolled by 2020.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
            The University
           </a>
           of the Sunshine Coast is leading the way amongst smaller regional universities successfully competing against their larger city counterparts. In addition, the single largest project to be undertaken in the seat of Fisher is the construction of the University of the Sunshine Coast public hospital, a greenfield site, at a cost of almost $2 billion. This tertiary public hospital, when it opens in April of 2017, will ultimately employ some 6,000 staff, one of whom will be my daughter Caroline, who is a graduating nurse. The Sunshine Coast is set to become the health hub of South-East Queensland, leading to many more thousands of health related jobs in the electorate.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the time for Fisher and the broader Sunshine Coast to flourish and grow to their full potential. With that growth, however, comes challenges. We are seeing unprecedented demand for residential and commercial land to be developed, with projects like the $7 billion Aura greenfield site, which will ultimately see a city the size of Gladstone housing 50,000 people just south of Caloundra. Palmview is another housing development to the north of the electorate. It will be home to an additional 17,000 people.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, parts of the seat of Fisher are already buckling under their own weight. Its road networks are struggling, and this is impacting on the quality of life of all those who have to commute to work, particularly those who have to take the 100-kilometre journey to Brisbane, a journey that can be a five-hour return trip. On the Sunshine Coast, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Bruce Highway
           </a>
           has, not so affectionately, been called the country's largest car park. The people of Fisher, and of the Sunshine Coast more broadly, are rightly demanding better road and rail infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
            If I
           </a>
           can achieve one thing in this place, my No. 1 priority for the people of Fisher will be better road and rail infrastructure, whatever form that may take. I applaud the Prime Minister for his stance on the funding of public rail projects and for his desire to see the 30-minute city come to fruition. But that same principle must apply also to the regions, not just to those living in Melbourne and Sydney. The internal road networks in Fisher, particularly around Caloundra and Kawana, are, sadly, not faring much better than our main arterial roads. Traffic congestion is leading to low productivity rates and less time spent with family.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are many other projects that I will seek to undertake during my first term as the federal member for Fisher. As a one-time subcontract carpenter then builder then construction barrister with 30 years experience in the building industry, I can inform the House that the health of our construction industry is dire. I applaud the Prime Minister for his tenacity in reintroducing the bill to reintroduce the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The building and construction industry is racked with corruption and self-interest. It is an industry that represents eight per cent of our
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           and that employs one in 10 Australians. We must clean up this industry for the sake of our country and the country's economy. Australians should understand that every tax dollar that is overspent on government projects is a dollar that is not spent on more roads, hospitals and police stations.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am also passionate about the protection of subcontractors' security of payment. With eight separate forms of security-of-payment regime in this country, it is time that we moved toward the harmonisation of our laws which seek to protect the subcontractors in Fisher and throughout the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mental health remains a significant problem for many of our people, both young and old alike. Our defence veterans of all ages increasingly are suffering from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
            PTSD
           </a>
           and depression. Our young people are self-harming and dying at their own hands in ever-increasing numbers. I want to work with organisations like the Thompson Institute based in Kawana to help research the causes of these awful afflictions and the treatments for those suffering from them. It is reported that mental health is costing our national economy $60 billion per year. That represents four per cent of our GDP. My family, like many others, has been impacted by mental health issues, and we must, as a community, continue to remove the stigma associated with those suffering from them, just as we must research ways of preventing them in the first instance.

           on the Sunshine Coast—unfortunately, even if we have to wait another 3½ years before it is finally rolled out. In raising Sarah, Leonie and I and the girls have learned the old adage that it really does take a village to raise a child. We are indebted to all our friends and the broader community who have helped our family. Now that Sarah is doing so well, I see that my tenure in this place, no matter how short or how long that may be, is a form of giving back to our adopted home that has given us so much.

           I will conclude with a prayer:

           God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
          </p>

           courage to change the things I can,
          </p>

           and wisdom to know the difference.
