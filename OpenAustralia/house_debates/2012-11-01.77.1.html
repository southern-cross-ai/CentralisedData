        My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. Minister, will you update the House on the progress that the government has made towards a national disability insurance scheme? How will this benefit people with disabilities, their families and their carers?

         I thank the member for Shortland very much for her question and for the way in which she stands up and advocates for people with disabilities and for carers in her electorate. One of the things that the member for Shortland knows well and that the question from the member for Denison also emphasised today is just how critical it is that we confront the reality that the system of disability care and support in Australia is underfunded and unfair. That is what people with disability in Australia face and have faced for a very long time.
        </p>
        <p>
         People with disability have waited for such a long time for change to the system of disability care and support. It is now time that this changed and this government is determined to make that change. We are determined to deliver a new system of disability care and support for this nation to make sure that people with disability do not face a lottery. It should not depend on where you live or how you got your disability or what the disability is. That is what people have faced for so many years.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will shortly be releasing for public discussion the draft bill to establish a national disability insurance scheme. That will be available. People will be able to see the way in which the legislation will build the framework for a national disability insurance scheme. This legislation will establish the launch transition agency. That agency will be established as an independent body that has the responsibility to run the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The legislation will also set out the way in which the agency intends to deliver planning and support for people with disability and for their families and their carers. I intend to introduce the legislation into the parliament before the end of this year. We went to make sure that we get it into the parliament and that it is available for all members of parliament and the public to have a very good look at before it is debated next year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The draft legislation has been well informed by thousands of conversations that we have had with people with disability, family members, carersâ€”all the people who need to have a say. There has been a lot of detailed discussions with those who work in the sector and also with the states and territories. I particularly thank those states that are host jurisdictions who have played such a constructive role.
