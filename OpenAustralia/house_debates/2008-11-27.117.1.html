        I know the member for Grey will work assiduously with us to support any legislation coming forward on the mandated renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 to aid the wind development in his electorate.

        I return to parliament this week after a busy week back at home and a rewarding time in my electorate of Braddon. There have been a few major achievements in recent weeks, one of which is also a pet project of the member for Bass, who is graciously in the chamber at the moment. It was quite satisfying to be able to tick off some important projects just a few weeks before the major milestone of a year in government. The first of these is something that has been more than a year in the making, and was the result of just a little nagging directed toward our Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, the very honourable Senator Carr. I refer to the launch and opening of Tasmania’s $12 million Enterprise Connect centre based in Burnie, which Senator Carr carried out quite admirably on 6 November. To launch what is a state-wide service, we were the guests of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Parker" rel="nofollow">
         Geoff Parker
        </a>
        and his excellent staff at Australian Weaving Mills in Devonport, one of the innovative companies which has seen the potential benefits of Enterprise Connect and grasped it with both hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did we fight so hard to see Enterprise Connect come to Tasmania and my area? Simply because I could see a great benefit to the state in having this centre, to build on what is a remarkably innovative region, the north-west coast of Tassie. This has been borne out by interest from companies like Australian Weaving Mills, who are a success story as one of the great survivors of Australia’s manufacturing sector. Enterprise Connect offers some real expertise in so many areas, and through the new Burnie based centre Tasmanian businesses can tap into that knowledge wherever it is in the country. It will also allow other centres and states to take advantage of Tasmania’s renowned innovators and share some of our knowledge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delivery of Enterprise Connect was followed up on 14 November by the announcement of $10 million for the patient transport assistance plan for Tasmania. I was pleased to represent the Minister for

        ,

        , to announce the Rudd government’s funding, which was combined with the Bartlett government’s major revamp of patient transport, in what I am sure will be a significant improvement for people at a time when they are in real need. The whole area of patient transport was constantly put to me before and during the election campaign as a vital area of concern. This was not just in terms of accessing appropriate forms of transport, assisting with the costs and having equipment to assist disabled and challenged patients using aircraft, but having access to accommodation when required to travel to receive medical assistance and treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the transport initiative, the Rudd government will provide up to $3 million to acquire additional patient transport vehicles in the north-west, north and south of the state; up to $3.1 million to establish low-cost patient accommodation in Burnie; up to $90,000 for upgrades to the Spurr Wing accommodation complex in Launceston in the electorate of Bass; up to $2.72 million to purchase new

        or who have to access it from the west coast; and up to $770,000 to implement new ‘telehealth’ initiatives to reduce the necessity for patients to travel to receive health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was back here in the nation’s capital last week for the announcement of $1.721 million in extra funds for the seven councils in Braddon, part of the government’s $300 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Some of the nay-sayers, particularly from the other side, have questioned this injection, but I have been in close contact with a number of the councils in my region and encouraged them to look at projects they can bring forward. They are thrilled to have an extra pot of money to put into some of their local infrastructure. The latest money for councils comes on top of $3.65 million in the next instalment of financial assistance grants in my electorate. The funding for the councils is one way the Rudd government is acting to stimulate the economy and protect against the uncertainty that grips the world at the moment and the Australian economy in general.
