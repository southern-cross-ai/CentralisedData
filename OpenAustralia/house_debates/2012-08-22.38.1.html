        I recently hosted Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Carr" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Carr
        </a>
        , the Minister for Human Services, in my electorate of Bass. We spent a very productive day visiting key department sites in Launceston. A visit to the local Centrelink office was a great opportunity for the minister and me to meet staff who are responsible for the administration of support that the Australian government provides to families, job seekers, students and pensioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Hearing" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Hearing
        </a>
        , which provides hearing assessments, hearing devices and rehabilitative programs to assist eligible clients in managing their hearing impairment. The minister and I met some patients who have benefited from this service, which is provided through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister and I had the privilege to present awards to two members of the Centrelink call centre in Launceston. Nicole Bailey received a national customer service award, and David Hallett received a 10-year recognition award for his service to the call centre. By all accounts both of these awards were well deserved, and it was a pleasure to meet Nicole, David and their colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the minister appreciated the opportunity to meet these individuals, who work hard and deliver programs for his department. I commend the work he is doing and thank him and his staff for an enjoyable and productive day in the great seat of Bass, in Tasmania.
