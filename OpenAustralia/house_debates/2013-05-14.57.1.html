       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that in last year's budget Labor promised to keep gross debt below $250 billion, bring the budget back to surplus and increase family tax benefit part A. In 2011 Labor promised to create 500,000 new jobs, and in 2010 it promised to cut company tax. Given that Labor has broken every single one of these budget promises, why should the Australian people believe anything that is promised tonight?

         I thank the member for his question and I thank him for his frankness on workplace relations policy, where at least he has said unashamedly and proudly, 'You can't have genuine flexibility without a form of statutory individual contracts with a no disadvantage test.' He is still a believer in

            <p>
             I am asked by the member about tonight's budget. The member will see tonight's budget when the Treasurer delivers it at 7:30 tonight, and what I can assure the member is that it is a budget based on the facts, right for these economic circumstances, focused on jobs as this government has always been focused on jobs—960,000 jobs, almost a million, created since this government came to office, an economy 13 per cent larger despite having to face the biggest economic shock the globe has seen since the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
              Great Depression
             </a>
             . Despite having to see that, we have put in place policies to support jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             I say to the member: if he is interested in the budget then he should direct his attention to the budget tonight, but when he does so he ought to take an approach based on the facts. The member opposite and, indeed, all those members opposite might be interested to know that former Prime Minister Howard was prepared to take an approach based on the facts when it comes to tonight's budget and, indeed, the government's budget in general. He said on 13 May, very recently:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             When the current prime minister and the treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most – they are right.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. I wouldn't have thought that was going to be possible a couple of years ago, and I don't think many people would have. Our unemployment has remained pleasingly quite low.
            </p>
            <p>
             Former Prime Minister Howard went on to say:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             And our debt to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
              GDP
             </a>
             ratio, the amount of money we owe to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the member, who worked as an adviser for former Prime Minister Howard, may want to note—
