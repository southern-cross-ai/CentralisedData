        I rise to update the chamber on the delivery of payments and programs by Services Australia on the peninsula in my electorate of Robertson. Last month, customers at Ettalong were informed Services Australia were required to vacate their current premises after the landlord received approval to redevelop the current site. I am advised Services Australia has been searching for an alternative property in Ettalong and surrounding suburbs for around two years but no suitable location has been identified. Whilst they continue to search for an appropriate premises, Services Australia are consolidating their Ettalong centre within the

        centre. Last month the Woy Woy centre was only the second location across Australia to enjoy a transformation that will ensure peninsula residents are offered state-of-the-art facilities. This will include upgrades to digital support facilities offering new appointment based services and tailored assistance for older Australians. It is one of the nation's first concept sites to test, explore and evaluate new service offers to improve the way Australians access face-to face-programs. I have fought hard to ensure the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        and the peninsula are one of the first regions in the country to experience this new model. I am pleased to inform the chamber that staff from the Ettalong centre will be employed at the Woy Woy service centre to ensure support is maintained for peninsula residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, I am advised that Services Australia are currently seeking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOI" rel="nofollow">
         EOI
        </a>
        s from local business and community groups to establish an Agent Service in Ettalong, which will provide face-to-face information and free self-help facilities to customers in Ettalong and will play a vital role in assisting customers to access government payments. Services Australia customers will be able to certify identification documents at the agent as well as photocopy, print and collect information products and brochures. The expression of interest has been extended until this Friday, 19 March, to give Services Australia the best possible opportunity to hear from suitable applicants on the peninsula. The organisation selected will be provided with all equipment required, a free all-hours wi-fi connection, an online training program with supporting materials and a remuneration package to be negotiated. The agent will be supported in their role by a Services Australia contact, who will make regular support visits and conduct reviews. I strongly encourage businesses and community organisations who may be interested to apply, and I look forward to this Agent Service being up and running as soon as possible to ensure customers in Ettalong can continue to access these services locally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ensuring that Australians receive the service and support they need during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a key focus of the Morrison government, and we will continue to listen and deliver for all Australians. Residents across the peninsula and across the Robertson electorate can be assured that the government will continue to work to ensure that our locals have access to the best government services.
