        , Bryan Ladowsky. It is wonderful that all of these students have achieved such a high standard and have been recognised for that wonderful achievement. For that we pay tribute, as well, to their fellow students, their parents, their peers and to the teachers at the school. It is right to be celebrating excellence and achievement. It is because of the importance of recognising the good work that is done within these schools, I have instituted the Higgins Medal to recognise leadership and service.

        But there is a threat to excellence at our schools and, in particular, the schools in Higgins. There is a threat by this government to the funding of those schools and their being able to continue delivering this excellence. It will be a threat because this government has not said that it will not consider another Latham-Gillard style hit list again on our schools. When I look to the indexation funding of our schools, it is not guaranteed beyond 2013. This will have a dramatic impact on 19 out of 42 schools in my electorate of Higgins. I want to briefly mention them:
