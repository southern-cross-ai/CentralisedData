       <p>
        Last night, I was delighted to attend Medicines Australia’s parliamentary dinner. Medicines Australia are a peak industry group representing Australia’s innovative medicine sector. Their membership includes over 80 per cent of the prescription pharmaceuticals market and has a specific focus on research and development leading to the manufacture and supply of a huge range of prescription medicines. More than half of our nation’s pharmaceutical companies are located at Macquarie business park, colloquially known as ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Pill Hill
        </a>
        ’, in the electorate of Bennelong that I represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pharmaceutical industry is a major player in Australia, selling over $11 billion worth of medicines domestically and approximately $4 billion in exports. Medicines Australia’s member companies provide direct employment to over 14,000 people in Australia. As a result, the health of this industry is strongly integrated into the health of our nation’s economy. Despite this, the primary focus of last night’s event was the essential role that Medicines Australia plays in the health of the people, as without our health no other endeavour or personal goal is of major significance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night’s event was hosted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Brendan Shaw and Chairman Will Delaat, who spoke in detail of some of the challenges facing this industry. The guest speaker was Dr Francis Gurry,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_General" rel="nofollow">
         Director General
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         World Intellectual Property Organisation
        </a>
        and the most senior Australian working in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        . Dr Gurry spoke with clarity and insight about the strong bridge between pharmaceuticals, research and development, and intellectual property. This matter is directly relevant to us here in federal parliament as we assess the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4497" rel="nofollow">
         Patent Amendment (Human Genes and Biological Materials) Bill 2010
        </a>
        . Ninety-eight submissions have been received by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which is investigating this private member’s bill. As the federal representative of the majority of Medicine Australia’s member companies, I am glad this bill is receiving a full, transparent analysis and I look forward to the committee’s response in June.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also must register my strong discontent with the Gillard government’s unprecedented cabinet decision to overrule recommendations by the pharmaceutical benefits advisory board. The established approval process provides certainty and stability in this important industry, and the government’s decision has caused significant damage and uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to congratulate Will, Brendan and those at Medicines Australia for hosting an informative and impressive evening, which is a strong reflection of the quality job they do in representing their member companies. As the federal member for Bennelong, covering ‘Pill Hill’, I believe that Medicines Australia is well aware of my commitment to providing strong representation for this industry.
