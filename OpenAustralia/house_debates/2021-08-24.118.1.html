        I rise tonight to highlight the ongoing situation facing Cairns and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        tourism sectors due to the state-government-enforced lockdowns and lockouts. The impact on Cairns and Far North Queensland businesses simply did not start with the recent three-day Cairns and Yarrabah lockdowns. Those were started by one COVID case and there was only one subsequent to that. It started well before that, firstly with the Sydney lockdown, then the South-East Queensland and Victorian lockdowns and then more recently with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        lockdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has prompted Tourism Tropical North Queensland, Advance Cairns and the chamber of commerce to write letters to the Prime Minister; to the Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annastacia_Palaszczuk" rel="nofollow">
         Annastacia Palaszczuk
        </a>
        ; and to the treasurers, both Frydenberg and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Dick" rel="nofollow">
         Cameron Dick
        </a>
        . That letter clearly outlined the situation facing the Cairns and Far North Queensland sectors. That letter was dated 11 August and it stated quite clearly that state and federal governments were being urged to target timely and direct wage support assistance, similar to the JobSaver program offered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government in conjunction with the Commonwealth, and to reintroduce the flexibility provisions of the Fair Work Act that were put in place for employers during the JobKeeper period, which would make a material difference to both employers and employees. They were also looking for a detailed COVID-19 transition map.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was on 11 August. On 20 August, not having received a response, I actually wrote to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        and to the Queensland Treasurer. I said that, while I appreciated the level of support announced thus far, it simply didn't go far enough to support businesses and workers affected by lockdowns. I talked not only about businesses in lockdown areas but also about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Douglas" rel="nofollow">
         Port Douglas
        </a>
        , Kuranda and the wider community. I pointed out that this had started well before the lockdown in Cairns—it went back to the New South Wales lockdown. I made the point that 50 per cent of everybody who comes into Cairns actually travels from New South Wales or Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        I said that, while the recently announced funding from the Commonwealth and Queensland governments was greatly appreciated, it fell well short of what was required. I told them that the Commonwealth stands ready to work with the Queensland government to continue to support tourism during Queensland affected lockdowns and lockouts. I told them that in my view there was an immediate need for direct business support for businesses in Cairns and I strongly encouraged them to put a further proposal to the Commonwealth government for funding. I said that I sincerely looked forward to working with them to deliver that solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was absolutely gobsmacked by the response I got from the Treasurer in Queensland. He responded to me within about 18 hours of my letter. I sent my letter at 5.30 on Friday and I received his response—not directly to me, but through my local media—at 4.30 the following day, Saturday. I didn't actually receive it myself until six o'clock that night. This is what he said to me, 'The Palaszczuk Labor government shares your concerns.' Fantastic! He then said that he had called on the federal government to reinstate JobKeeper but that the call had fallen on deaf ears. Then he went on to say, 'While the New South Wales and Victorian governments have had their credit ratings downgraded due to the pandemic the outlook for the federal government's credit rating has been upgraded this year, leaving the Australian federal government as one of the few in the world to retain a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAA
        </a>
        rating among the major rating agencies.' Wow! Surprise, surprise! He continued that it is now time for the federal government to put credit ratings back to work by returning JobKeeper to support businesses and communities. He said: 'I note that the federal government has strong financial capacity but that its political security is weak. The Morrison government holds government by the slimmest possible majority, holding only 76 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives. This means that a single backbencher has the power to force the federal government to change. Warren, this places you in a position of incredible influence.' This is an absolute disgrace!
       </p>
       <p>
        He then went on to say, 'You have the power to tell the Prime Minister and your colleagues to change and to advise your colleagues that if they don't restore JobKeeper you'll cross the floor in government,' and he 'reminded' me: 'It was your crucial vote that led to the removal of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        as the Prime Minister. I urge you to exercise the same power again for the benefit of the people of Far North Queensland.' What a disgraceful political response, when the people are on their knees in Far North Queensland! To resort to that type of nonsense is just—
