        I move:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of housing for Defence at Yamanto Hills, Ipswich, Queensland.

        proposes the construction of 72 residential houses on land at Yamanto Hills in Ipswich, Queensland. The proposal will provide housing for

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel at an estimated construction cost of $19.63 million. The Yamanto Hills site will form part of the new Ipswich suburb of Yamanto, by road some seven kilometres south of Ipswich city and seven kilometres south-east of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley. The objective of the proposal is to provide 72 new residences by the end of 2010 for Australian Defence Force personnel stationed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        . These houses will be funded through the government’s recently announced Nation Building and Jobs Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Defence Force has recently expanded its operations at RAAF Base Amberley with the addition of Army’s 9th Force Support Battalion and RAAF’s No. 36 Squadron. These moves have substantially increased the housing needs for defence families in the Ipswich area. Community standard housing for families is vital to the Australian Defence Force in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in the Defence Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Development of the Yamanto Hills site will be governed by Defence Housing Australia through a number of contractors. The site will be developed in accordance with Defence Housing Australia’s project-specific guidelines and the national specification covering performance and design requirements for Defence Housing Australia houses. Subject to parliamentary and Defence Housing Australia board approval, construction will commence in October 2009 and will be completed by October 2010. I commend the motion to the House.
