        Ipswich is in mourning with the recent passing of its most respected business leader Thomas Haddon Edwards at the age of 87. Tom was the owner of prominent electrical store and family business
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT" rel="nofollow">

        Edwards and Sons, which was a household name for decades. The firm was founded by Tom's father, Roy, who went into the ministry. He started the door-to-door electrical repair business during the 1930s Depression before selling electrical goods and opening the original RT Edwards store in the Ipswich CBD.

        , Tom was a talented sportsman. He completed national service and an electrical apprenticeship in the family business. Tom went on to become general manager of the business, building it up to a chain of more than a dozen stores across Queensland and interstate, employing more than 300 staff. He took over the business at the age of 19 years. RT Edwards would go on to become the largest shareholder in the former Retravision group.

        Tom was always focused on his customers. Further, he made every effort to know his staff and believed they were his greatest business asset. Tom was a great communitarian and received an

He was a true Christianâ€”faith, hope and love were exemplified in Tom. He was a member of Ipswich Rotary for 55 years, a member of the chamber of commerce and a two-time winner of the chamber's Business Person of the Year Award. He was often co-opted to help local committees and projects such as appointments to the

        On Friday I attended Tom's funeral at his beloved Raceview Congregational Church, which was a wonderful celebration of his very full life. It was an honour to be there. My family has known the Edwards family in Ipswich for generations. In the eulogy for his father, Tom's son Gary, a good friend of mine, best summed up his dad is this way: 'He was a capable, relational, outstanding businessmen, a true gentleman and a generous man who had a passion to serve others and show his faith in practical ways.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom is survived by his wife of 64 years, Ivy, who he loved so dearly; his four children, Gary, Suzanne, Paul, Anne-Maree and their partners; nine grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. My sincere condolences to his whole extended family and his many friends. Vale,
