       <p>
        I would like to welcome proudly to the parliament today nine leaders from Indi. To Hannah, Will, Riley, Caleb, Mark, Quin, Brody, Lindsay and Jacqui, as our leaders, I would like to thank you for what you have done and for what you will do. I acknowledge the work that young people do in my electorate and I commit to be your representative in this place. Some of these young people are from Victory Lutheran College and are accompanied by principal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         John Thompson
        </a>
        . I take this opportunity to acknowledge Victory college, and I thank the board, the 80 staff and the people who look after the 670 children who go to this wonderful school and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Victory was established in 1992 by the Wodonga Lutheran parish, and since that time it has gone from strength to strength. It plays a critical part in our community. Over lunch with these young leaders today we had the opportunity to talk about the issues facing young people in Albury-Wodonga. We talked about the role of politics in influencing law, of the importance of turning up and having your voices heard. Today I have committed to return to the school in particular next year to talk to these young people about youth mental health and what I might do in my role, and what together we might do to address the scourge that is hitting our community. I welcome these young people.
