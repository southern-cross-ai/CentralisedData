        My question is to the Minister for the Environment representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister please outline to the House how the Morrison government's plan for a stronger future makes significant investments in the long-term safety, health and economic security of women across Australia?

         I thank the member for Higgins for her question and note her strong leadership in all matters pertaining to women and girls in her electorate. This is our second women's budget, and together they have delivered $5.5 billion. This budget supports Australian women at every stage, every age and every walk of life, and we have the serious investment that backs that right in.
        </p>
        <p>
         The women's workforce participation rate is at a record high. The women's unemployment rate is at a record low. There are more women in jobs—and they're better-paying jobs—than there ever were before. The economic plan outlined by the Treasurer last night will improve the outcomes and opportunities for women, and it will deliver an even stronger and more productive economy. That, of course, gives women greater choice, greater flexibility and greater economic security. As I said, there are more women in highly skilled jobs than ever before, taking up more leadership positions and now holding over 50 per cent of Australian government board positions, compared to 41.7 per cent when we came into government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that despite this progress there remain a range of barriers to women's workforce participation. So, this budget invests nearly $500 million in women's economic security measures to address these barriers, and front and centre is our enhanced paid parental leave for families. It means that eligible working parents can share—

           up to 20 weeks of fully flexible entitlements between them, because we know that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to parental leave and family arrangements.
          </p>
          <p>
           This budget is about delivering the essential services that women need, and women's safety is absolutely paramount. We talked about an enormous downpayment in the last budget of over a billion dollars for women's safety. Once more, we are building on that, investing a further $1.3 billion based on the four pillars of our next national plan, because we understand that in order to work towards ending all forms of violence against women and children we have to have a sustained, collaborative, national effort. We have to address the drivers of this violence so that we keep women safe at home, at school, at work, online and in the community.

             With our women's safety package, there are measures such as our Escaping Violence program, greater access to dedicated legal services to really support victims of sexual assault, and new models of care to access trauma-informed recovery. The Morrison government is deeply committed to safety, security and opportunity for Australian women, and this budget reflects that.
