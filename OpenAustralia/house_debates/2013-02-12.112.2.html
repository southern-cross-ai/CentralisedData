       <p>
        It has been a very grim fortnight for the small business community of Australia. We have seen time and time again this terrible Gillard Labor government insult the small business community, ignore their interests and demonstrate this pattern of disinterest that we have all become used to. What happened last night in Senate estimates? Well, the Prime Minister's own department has revealed that the Prime Minister rarely concerns herself with small business issues, further demonstrating this government's neglect of the sector. Asked whether the Prime Minister has met the inaugural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        Commissioner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Brennan" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Brennan
        </a>
        , a representative of the department said: 'No. Small business and issues of that kind do not represent the priorities of the day that the Prime Minister turns her mind to.' The department representative went on to say: 'Small business issues don't often come up in terms of issues that are before the Prime Minister or before the cabinet, and I guess our focus of resources tends to focus on those issues that are before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        or the cabinet, so I guess we would move our resources in accordance with these priorities.'
       </p>
       <p>
        What a disappointment this must be for my constituency and the electorate that I represent, and small businesses right across the country. It comes off the back of the neglect and the forgetfulness of this government to actually invite a small business representative to be a part of the B20—this business advisory group supposedly helping the government understand what is going on in the economy. Never mind the fact that small business generates half the private sector workforce. The new minister forgot to be reminded by the previous minister—the fourth in 14 months—that small business is a crucial part of the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it gets worse. This revolving door of ministers seems to have revealed itself in other ways. The Prime Minister set out, at her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Press Club
        </a>
        address, to 'do three things: to take stock of our nation's position, to outline the actions needed to shape our future, and to detail a plan for this year'. Well, again small business did not crack it for a mention in the account of how things are going—because things are very challenging, and there is a reason the Prime Minister would not turn her mind to the challenges that small businesses face. On any issue about shaping the future, we know the coalition understands, believes and demonstrates time and time again that our economic prosperity is interwoven with the success of small businesses. And small business economy is the economy of where people live, and how crucial it is to the future. But no; the Prime Minister could not manage to do that either.
       </p>
       <p>
        So here we have this pattern of disinterest and neglect. One forgetful action you could almost understand, but this is a systematic approach. Small business owners and operators and those interested in this crucial part of the economy are absolutely bewildered as to why the Gillard government never misses an opportunity to show any disinterest at all. They forget every time. Every opportunity when small business should be front of mind for this government, they ignore it. Contrast that with the real solutions plan of the Abbott government: the centrepiece, our plan for small business; many policy commitments; and, even in the last fortnight, another constructive suggestion about how to make disaster relief more responsive to small business. Yet still no interest—
