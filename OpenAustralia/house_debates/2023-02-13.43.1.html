        HAINES () (): I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Sir Andrew Sheppard Grimwade
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBE" rel="nofollow">

        late of Mansfield, who passed away aged 92 on 30 January. Andrew's contributions to Australian science, arts and life are manifold and distinguished. Andrew was a chemical engineer, trained at the University of Melbourne; a scientist, trained at Oxford; a philanthropist; a businessman; and a cattle breeder. He gave over 50 years of service to the

        . He was a founding member of the Australian government Remuneration Tribunal, an inaugural member of the Council for the Order of Australia, and a member of Australia's first trade mission to the

        of China.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Andrew retired to Mansfield, he threw himself into the local community. He led the establishment of the not-for-profit Beolite retirement village, serving as chair of the board right up until last year. He organised bequests for Mansfield Autism Statewide Services and Rosehaven Hospice. He quietly contributed to the historical society, to the emergency precinct and to local campaigns against gambling and fast food.

        He was an extraordinary networker, a connecter of people. To me, he was a learned guide with an infectious positivity for our nation. I offer my condolences to Sir Andrew's wife, Marsha; to his son, Angus; to his grandsons Lachlan and Campbell; and to his many extended family and friends. Vale,
