        by leaveâ€”I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) the time and order of business for Tuesday, 14 February, 2012 being as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the House shall meet at 12 noon;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) during the period from 12 noon until 2 p.m. any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister during this period, shall stand deferred until the conclusion of the discussion of a matter of public importance; and;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) during the period from 12 noon until 2 p.m. if any member draws the attention of the Speaker to the state of the House, the Speaker shall announce that he will count the House at the conclusion of the discussion of a matter of public importance, if the Member then so desires; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just briefly, there is agreement between the government, the opposition and the crossbenchers on this change, which we are making as early as possible for the convenience of not just members but parliamentary staff. It means that the House shall meet at 12 noon tomorrow rather than 2 pm. During that time there will not be votes; it will just allow for further contributions to the debates that are before the House. I commend the motion to the House and thank the opposition for their support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
