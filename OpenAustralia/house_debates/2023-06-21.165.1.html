        Congratulations go to Dr Paul Collett of Gloucester, who's been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the

         King's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        . This award recognises his lifetime of service to the healthcare sector. He graduated from the University of

        and came to Gloucester originally as part of a New South Wales rotation component of his

        training program. He's dedicated himself to the provision of invaluable medical care and services to those in regional and remote locations. Well done, Paul.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations are also in order for Wingham's Jacqueline Hyde, who's been awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        in the 2023 King's Birthday Honours list. In 1954, Jacqueline joined the Pilliga branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        . Since then, she has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of rural women and children around regional New South Wales, and now, at age 93, her efforts have been finally recognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, a shout out and congratulations to Forster local Jan Irvine, who's also been recognised in this year's King's Birthday Honours. Her OAM is the culmination of decades of volunteer work and incredible community contributions through her long-time membership and activity in Quota International. One of her many accomplishments in a very lengthy list is mobilising a tele-thrombolysis service in the Manning Base hospital. As Jan and her fellow members already know, we notice that you were instrumental in getting the life-saving service for stroke patients into the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cheyne Flanagan received an OAM for wildlife preservation and conservation. Over many years she's been an active biologist and volunteer trainer involved in wildlife rehabilitation after becoming involved in conservation in 1973. She has many accomplishments. The best known being her 23 years involvement with the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Well done, Cheyne and all of your other volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations also to Wauchope's Jaci Fisher, who has been awarded an OAM for her contribution to public administration. She's been involved in many volunteer pursuits over the years, including as an assistant coach for Wauchope/Port Macquarie Riding for the Disabled. That group has done so much for the disabled. It has really liberated them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, congratulations go to
