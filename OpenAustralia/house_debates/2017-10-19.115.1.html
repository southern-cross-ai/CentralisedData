        October the 11th was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of the Girl Child, and many in this House spoke of attending special events to make sure we know that girls and women are a significant part of our society. What the heck is wrong with us? We are 'woman'—the one who gives life to every individual on this planet, the one who endures extreme pain during childbirth and the one who's most often seen as a second-class citizen. Acknowledging the International Day of the Girl Child is acknowledging that we and societies around the world don't treat women as the sustaining part of community or society.

        Recently, as Chair of the Australian Parliamentary Group on Population and Development, I attended the general assembly of an internationally aligned group called the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development. I'd like to note the hard work of Dr Mika Marumoto, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Director
        </a>
        of the AFPPD, and the Hon. Professor

        </a>
        , the Chair of the AFPPD, who, unfortunately, due to the dissolving of the Japanese parliament, was unable to attend the assembly. As a consequence, I was lucky enough to be invited to do that job.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were 30 nations at this forum, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" rel="nofollow">
         Central Asia
        </a>
        , South-East Asia,

        , with elected men and women from our region and beyond determined to make a difference as a priority on matters relating to women's empowerment, education, economic independence and a reduction of gender based violence. In addition, there is the need to pay attention to our youth, with some nations having in excess of 50 per cent youth unemployment. Finally, in nations with settled economies and lengthy periods of peace, there is the issue of caring for the ageing population. Each and every one of these matters has both a direct and an indirect effect on the life of the girl child, whether in her early life or in her years of wisdom. We should be celebrating all our people every day and not just pick one sector, like girls, pay lip service to them and do nothing else. As a society, here in Australia and internationally, we are of one mind in the pursuit of gender equity, women's empowerment, and women's safety and health. These issues are priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a local level there are groups like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        and the Smith Family, and some individuals, like Nikki Morris, an ambassador for
        <i>
         Embrace
        </i>
        , who ran an Empower Me camp. They all recognise that girls and their confidence begin to be lost between the ages of 10 and 12. These groups are assisting with scholarships and workshops to rebuild that confidence so that girls can—and can be encouraged to think that they should—take on half the world. After all, we make up 51 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a global level we see actions like the 'gag rule', withdrawing essential funding for programs that have been instrumental in changing women's lives for the better. This change to funding will push so many programs backwards. We must collectively work and advocate wherever possible to have funding for these programs restored. They have led to educational emancipation and addressed issues related to health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me share a disturbing image from Arthur Erken of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNFPA" rel="nofollow">

        . We still have an international maternal death rate equal to two jumbo jets crashing to earth—that's 800 women—every day. It is of great significance that many countries have introduced a minimum marriage age, laws to protect families and laws to support victims of family violence. There's an overarching responsibility to develop projects that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. This is indeed an international responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the recognition of women's participation in policymaking, politics and peace-making negotiations is an inspiration for all of us to take on and apply to the best of our ability and position. We must empower our girls and women through education, being good role models, training, political mentorship and encouragement. As an essential part of this, women's health rights need to be promoted and respected. It is part of her personal recognition of her potential to fill a role as an economic source, an anchor for her family and a leader in her community.

        and young girls who were youth parliamentarians, I've set myself two personal targets to promote women and girls in Gilmore. I'll have a Girls in Leadership weekend to discuss skills needed and barriers to be wary of, to listen to inspiration from present and past members of different levels of government, and to build confidence. I'll invite young adults from my region, on a fifty-fifty male-female basis, to help establish a Gilmore Youth Parliament to enable them to have a voice they currently don't have. They are frustrated that their views on politics, education and other local issues cannot be heard. It's absolutely time to do more for our girls.
