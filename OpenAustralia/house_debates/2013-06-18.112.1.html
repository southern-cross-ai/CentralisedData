       <p>
        I rise today to speak of Australia's relationship with our nearest neighbour,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        , and the principles and the story that can shape our future interactions. Australia is indeed a proud nation, with so much to celebrate: our freedom, our democracy, our diversity, our generosity, our respect for one another and, of course, our diverse and magnificent land. The people of Macquarie embody these values so well, and I am proud to represent this community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's connections with our nearest neighbours, our friends in the Pacific, run deeply through the social, political and emotional veins of our nation. From the now-significant number of Australians born in the Pacific or of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islander
        </a>
        extraction to Australia's long-standing involvement in regional development, our connection to the Pacific is strong, and will continue to strengthen. As these connections grow, it is especially important that we remain mindful of our responsibilities, particularly to those closest to us—our nearest neighbours.

        we will celebrate the 38th anniversary of Papua New Guinea's establishment as an independent nation, following periods as an Australian post-war colony and under the rule of various foreign states since 1884.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        is a young state, still growing in its economic and social contexts, but still home to a rich and diverse cultural tapestry which is tremendously complex, ancient and steeped in tradition. PNG's story is also partially my own story. Twenty-five years ago, I was fortunate to marry my husband, Jim, who was originally born in Papua New Guinea, and now, of course, calls Australia home. We have two beautiful children, Joshua and Hannah. My husband has significant responsibilities as leader of his family, and I have seen firsthand the challenges faced by many Papua New Guineans, and particularly by my extended family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Limited or no access for girls to education is common, as is the preventable spread of easily treatable disease. We are fortunate to have been able to assist our family and to provide support to girls who would not otherwise have access to education, and to have been able to fund medical assistance for family members. In other instances, however, the lack of access to critical resources and support have had tragic consequences. I have lost nieces and nephews to childbirth complications and malaria, each death being entirely preventable.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a formal context PNG is a young state, growing in an economically and socially developing context. The cultures that form the rich tapestry that is Papua New Guinea are, however, tremendously complex, ancient and, as I have already mentioned, steeped in tradition. Over 850 different cultural groups and languages exist, and more than 80 per cent of PNG's population live in territorial lands, often isolated from other communities and urban centres. The complex nature of this cultural system and practical hindrances necessarily render it tremendously difficult to implement development on a wide scale.
       </p>
       <p>
        Success is heavily dependent upon very close adaptation to regional and local context and—and I believe this is a most critical point—the active cooperation and collaboration of members of each local community. So on this upcoming anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence, whilst also celebrating with my own family, I have dwelt upon the anniversaries yet to come. I hope that when each of these passes we will reflect on how many more children have been saved from preventable diseases that year than the last; how many more girls have learnt to read and write; and, critically, whether we have done everything we can to assist. Australia is a nation that has significant resources, whether it be in industry, in business, in skills, in our resources and connections to the rest of the globe. It is our privilege to be able to assist other nations. It is my great hope that we will continue to do so and to grow in our partnership, working alongside and with our partners to improve the lives of all Papua New Guineans.
