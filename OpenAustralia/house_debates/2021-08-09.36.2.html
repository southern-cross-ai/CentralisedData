        Those of us who enjoy the privilege of serving in this national parliament do not get here by ourselves. Family and friends matter, but so do local party members who preselect us and then campaign for our election. We stand on their shoulders.

        I rise to pay tribute to a true believer, Ardashes Tchamkertenian, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 90. Ardashes was a great rank-and-file volunteer for the cause of Labor. Born in Cairo of Armenian descent, he migrated to Australia in 1979 with his beloved wife, Marie, and young son, Hagop. He was fluent in Armenian, Arabic, French and English and ran a hardware store in Cairo, but he wanted the better life for his family that Australia offered. He worked hard, and he was a tireless volunteer in his later years. After Marie died in 2004, he'd spend every morning in my office, having a cup of tea, reading the paper and opening mail.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ardashes was passionate. He would take anyone not accepting a Labor how-to-vote card at prepoll as a personal insult, and he disliked Liberals and the Greens equally. He wore a cap every single day and would often be seen around Marrickville in a campaign shirt, not just during elections.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ardashes had a heart of gold and made a great contribution to his new country, Australia. May he rest in peace. My condolences go to his family and friends.
