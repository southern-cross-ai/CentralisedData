       <p>
        I'm pleased to inform the House that on 6 May I will attend, along with the Governor-General, the coronation of His Majesty
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles_III" rel="nofollow">
         King Charles III
        </a>
        in London. Our nation will be represented at the historic event by us along with all state governors and a number of other notable Australians, most of whom are based in the United Kingdom. Outstanding citizens have been chosen to show the world the best of our values: caring for others, serving community and championing progress. I note that the Palace requested in particular that there be significant representation from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        as part of the coronation. There will be a holder of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        for Australia and another of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Valour" rel="nofollow">
         Cross of Valour
        </a>
        attending, as well as representatives of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        While in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , I will meet with Prime Minister Sunak to continue what have already been very productive discussions on defence and security co-operation, as well as trade and investment ties. I note that the Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement received royal assent in the United Kingdom on 23 March. This is an achievement both sides of this House have played a role in. I'm sure all members will welcome the new jobs and opportunities this agreement will unlock.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the trip, I will also visit Barrow-in-Furness, which will play a key role in manufacturing the first AUKUS submarine and will also be a source of great expertise and training opportunities for the next generation of Australian defence manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to that, we will give notice, as soon as details are finalised—I've spoken with the Leader of the Opposition—about the Quad leaders meeting that will take place in May. When those arrangements are finalised, we will, through you, Mr Speaker, and through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        , give members and senators as much notice as possible for those arrangements.
