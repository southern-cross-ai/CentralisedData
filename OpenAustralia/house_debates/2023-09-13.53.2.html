        My question is to the Prime Minister. Australians are watching the slow-moving train wreck that is the Albanese government. Energy, grocery prices and mortgages are up because of incompetent and economy-wrecking decisions made by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the energy minister. The Prime Minister's campaign on the Voice is a disaster, dividing families and our nation. When will the Prime Minister start making decisions which will help and not hurt Australians?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his sledge. It really was a very wide bow, so it gives me the opportunity to give a very wide answer. The Leader of the Opposition has a record of deception as long as your arm. He speaks about our energy policy. This is the guy who said that business leaders were complaining to him about our safeguard mechanism, when in fact the business community, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA" rel="nofollow">
          BCA
         </a>
         , said their members supported it. He then went on to talk about energy policy, while voting against relief—$3 billion of relief—for Australian families. He claimed that he'd had conversations with Indigenous elders in Leanora to convince him to vote no in the referendum, when those same elders say that he advised them to vote yes. That's what they had to say. He told his own party room their official position would be a legislated national Voice, and then blindsided them by going into a press conference and getting rid of any concept of a national Voice. Last week in this chamber, he stood up at this dispatch box and said it was a good thing that we were attending
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN

         and the G20 and participating in international forums and said, 'When the Prime Minister leaves Australia to represent our nation, we're bipartisan. We want the world to know that.' Then, the next day, he mocked it. The next day he opposed it. He accused the

           Mr Speaker, on relevance—it was a wide-ranging question. He can talk about any of his government's decisions. He won't talk about any of them. What's he got to hide?

             </a>
             had had dinner at the Lodge in Kirribilli, when the last time he was there was under Prime Minister Morrison. This is what he had to say about Qantas: 'Qantas is an iconic Australian brand. All of us have pride in seeing the success of the company. Alan Joyce is an exceptional
