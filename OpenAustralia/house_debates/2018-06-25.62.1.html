        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House why it is important to encourage employment through lower taxes and not attack those in the economy who create jobs? Is the Prime Minister aware of any alternative approaches?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for her question. Our plan for a stronger economy is delivering record jobs growth. Last year, 2017, had the highest jobs growth in Australia's history—the best jobs growth we've ever seen—and we have 3.1 per cent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         growth, so we're delivering more jobs and stronger economic growth. That means you get stronger government revenues, which means we can bring the budget back into balance a year earlier. It means we can provide tax relief to hardworking Australian families so they can keep more of the money they earn. It's their money.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the Labor Party think it's the government's money. The Labor Party has a completely different perspective on hardworking Australians' earnings. They see any tax relief as a giveaway. The government is giving money away. Well, it's not. Australians work hard. They are facing rising costs of living. They want to get ahead and they want to be able to keep more of the money they earn. And, thanks, to the stronger economy, to the stronger jobs growth, to the keen economic management of the government that is ensuring the government funds all of those essential services we need with increasing amounts every year and at the same time lives within its means, we are able to provide vital tax relief to hardworking Australian families, supporting enterprise, encouraging aspiration, encouraging Australians to get ahead, ensuring that not only do middle-income families have more money in their pocket from their money but they'll keep more of the money they earn next year and through the whole reform plan. We'll get to a point where we'll have 94 per cent of Australians paying no more than 32½c in every extra dollar they earn. This is a massive reform.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the alternative from the Labor Party is one that is designed to demonise anyone that wants to get ahead. Today the Leader of the Opposition talked about wanting to encourage people who earn $40,000, $60,000, $80,000, $100,000 to get ahead. Anyone on $100,000 today is going to be massively worse off under the Labor Party should they be allowed to implement their tax scheme. There's no doubt about that. Labor has turned its back on aspiration. It has embraced the politics of envy and a class war, and the member for Grayndler has called it out. We may be getting to the end of winter but the member for Grayndler is coming.
