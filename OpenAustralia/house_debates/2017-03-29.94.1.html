       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday and today the Prime Minister has failed four times to rule out pay cuts for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        officers, including his own protection detail, by claiming that negotiations were occurring at arm's length from government. But the previous Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was willing to step in to resolve the pay increase problems with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Forces" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Forces
        </a>
        . Why is this Prime Minister unwilling to step up and take the same action as the former Prime Minister to look after AFP officers, who also keep Australian safe?

         Let us be quite clear: throughout my life I have represented many people; I have represented people with lots of money and people with no money; I have represented the battlers and I have represented the big end of town. But the one thing I have always done is I have always done the best for them. Now I am representing every Australian and I am doing the best for them now—

            Manager of Opposition Business, I have heard your point of order. I listened very carefully to the question and I have a summary of it here. The Prime Minister is relating his material to the substance of the question. I am listening to him very carefully—he is relevant so far. I call the Prime Minister.

             When you take the lives and destinies of other people in your hands and when you represent them, you owe it to them to do your best, you owe it to them to tell them the truth and that is what I have done right through my life. But not the Leader of the Opposition—he has hidden one payment after another, one cash payment from an employer after another. He would not even tell his members the truth about a political donation. That is what we are talking about here: we are talking about character, conviction and commitment. The Leader of the Opposition lacks them all. He would not stand up for anybody, apart from himself.

             I have built businesses, I have employed workers, I have striven to employ more Australians in more jobs in more businesses and now, as Prime Minister, I and all of my government stand up for Australians, defending their jobs, securing their future. What does the Leader of the Opposition do? He sells them out, just like he sold out the members of the
