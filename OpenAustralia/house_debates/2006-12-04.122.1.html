       (ii)    a law, or an instrument in force under a law, of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:   For whether leave guaranteed under this Part counts as service, see subsections 238(2) (annual leave), 260(2) (paid personal leave), 261(2) (unpaid carer’s leave) and 316(2) (parental leave).
      </p>
      <p>
       Entitlement to leave for all nominal hours in a day also extends to other hours on that day
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:               Bianca is employed by BBB Bakers Pty Ltd. She works 40 hours per week (consisting of 38 hours plus 2 reasonable additional hours).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection 232(2), Bianca is entitled to accrue paid annual leave of 1/13 of her nominal hours worked for each completed 4 week period of continuous service with BBB Bakers. Because of subparagraph 229(1)(a)(ii), Bianca’s nominal hours worked in a week are capped at 38 hours. If Bianca works her normal hours for a 12 month period, she will accrue 152 hours of paid annual leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above subsection ensures that Bianca will be able to be absent from work for 4 full 40 hour weeks. Bianca’s absence for the additional 8 hours will not be paid leave, and will not count as service, but it will not break her continuity of service (see subsection (8)).

       245A  Entitlement to cash out an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:   If, under this section, an employee forgoes an entitlement to take an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave, the employee’s employer may deduct that amount from the amount of accrued paid personal/carer’s leave credited to the employee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:   The protected amount of paid personal/carer’s leave for an employee whose nominal hours worked for an employer each week over a continuous period of 12 months service with the employer are 38 hours would be 114 hours (which would be equivalent to 15 days of paid personal/carer’s leave for that employee).
      </p>
      <p>
       247A  Entitlement to leave for all nominal hours in a day also extends to other hours on that day
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:               Tina is employed by Terrific Videos Pty Ltd. She works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, giving a weekly total of 40 hours per week (consisting of 38 hours plus 2 reasonable additional hours).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection 246(2), Tina is entitled to accrue paid personal/carer’s leave of
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
       /26 of her nominal hours worked for each completed 4 week period of continuous service with Terrific Videos. Because of subparagraph 241(1)(a)(ii), Tina’s nominal hours worked in a week are capped at 38 hours. If Tina works her normal hours for a 12 month period, she will accrue 76 hours of paid personal/carer’s leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above subsection ensures that Tina will be able (subject to the requirements of this Division relating to entitlement to paid personal/carer’s leave) to be absent from work for 10 full 8 hour days. Tina’s absence for the additional 4 hours over those 10 days will not be paid leave, and will not count as service, but it will not break her continuity of service (see subsection (2)).
