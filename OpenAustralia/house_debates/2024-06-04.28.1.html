       <p>
        Everyone who pays tax in Aston will receive a tax cut on 1 July, and award workers in Aston now know that, on the same date, they will also get a pay rise. It's a 3.75 per cent increase, which will help working people keep ahead of inflation. This is because the Albanese Labor government is committed to helping working people and delivering real cost-of-living relief. Labor's tax cuts mean greater tax relief for low- and middle-income taxpayers, who are disproportionately women. That's retail workers, hospitality workers, factory workersâ€”so many of the essential workers that we celebrated not so long ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        For full-time workers, the combination of the pay rise and tax cuts means that retail workers will get $102 a week extra, minimum wage workers will get $120 a week extra, and aged-care workers, because of the work our government has done in supporting a pay rise for them, will get $200 a week extra in their bank accounts. With an average tax cut of just over $1,500, plus the 3.75 per cent increase in pay, award workers and taxpayers in Aston will earn more and keep more of what they earn. My office has received many emails and phone calls from constituents who were wrapped that we have made these changes to ensure our tax system is fairer for working people. I encourage all my hardworking constituents in Aston to see how much they will be saving by using the tax cut calculator on the Treasury website.
