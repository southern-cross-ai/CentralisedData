        My electorate of Chisholm is home to many fantastic sporting clubs, all of which make valuable contributions to the local community every day. Recreational and community sport provides significant benefits by bringing people together and providing opportunities for social interaction, as well as having proven mental health benefits. I recognise outstanding sporting achievements and congratulate the many award winners across Chisholm in recent months. Chisholm was represented strongly at this year's

        I'm a proud member of Prime Minister Turnbull's team, as we support grassroots sport, which is a priority for the government. I am very proud to have delivered on my election commitment to have provided $890,000 in funding for the Waverley District Netball Association's new courts and facilities in Ashwood, providing the 4,000 players who use the courts regularly and residents in my electorate of Chisholm with a much safer place to play and train. This will further encourage local girls and women to participate in the competition.

        A few weeks ago I had the privilege of attending the Bennettswood Bowls Club, at their presentation day and afternoon tea. This was a great opportunity to mingle with the wonderful people at the Bennettswood Bowls Club and to recognise outstanding performances and contributions in the club. Congratulations to

        Through the Stronger Communities Program grants, I'm pleased to have delivered funding to many fantastic local sporting clubs, including the Box Hill United Pythagoras Soccer Club, Kerrimuir United Cricket Club, Eastern Lions Soccer Club, Ashwood Sports Club, North Box Hill Tennis Club and Nunawading Basketball. Sporting clubs are the heart and soul of many Australian communities, particularly in my electorate of Chisholm. That's why the Turnbull government is backing community sport, providing $29.7 million in infrastructure grants for local sporting clubs.
