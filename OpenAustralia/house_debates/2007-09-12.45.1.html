        My question is addressed to the Minister for

         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . Would the minister update the House on the progress of the Mersey hospital at Latrobe in Tasmania? Why is it important to create a Commonwealth funded, community controlled hospital on the north-west coast of Tasmania in my electorate of Braddon? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies, and what is the government’s response?

        <p>
         I certainly thank the member for Braddon for his question. I can inform him and the House that the Howard government wants to make the Mersey hospital in Tasmania a Commonwealth funded, community controlled public hospital because the state government is proposing to withdraw acute services from that hospital and, in so doing, leave a catchment of up to 70,000 people without general hospital services. Let me say for the benefit of all members of this House, including the people who are chattering away and the person who is turning his back: taking over a public hospital is not an easy thing. There are the financial arrangements to be considered, there is the future of staff to be considered, but most of all there is the continuity of care of patients which needs to be considered, because that cannot be interrupted for a single hour if people are serious about health policy and health service delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform the House that, after a somewhat rocky start, discussions between the Commonwealth and the state of Tasmania are now progressing well and a binding agreement should be signed within a week. I was interested to note that the Tasmanian government is already spending some of the extra money that it will receive as a result of this agreement. Taking over one hospital is no walk in the park. Taking over the 750 public hospitals of Australia would be the largest financial and logistical undertaking this country has ever seen, involving billions of dollars in assets, $24 billion a year in recurrent funding and the futures of hundreds of thousands of staff, including 200,000 nurses. If members opposite are elected, this deal will be in the hands of the member for Griffith, whose previous experience is of closing 2,200 public hospital beds in Queensland, thereby earning him the nickname ‘

           I will withdraw that if it is an offensive term, but it cannot alter the reality. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who seems to be attending now to the proceedings of the parliament: you cannot promise to take over 750 public hospitals and say, ‘Trust me; it will all come right on the night.’ You have to answer some specific questions. Who will be in charge of this health reform commission that will make recommendations about the process? What precise criteria will the state governments have to meet in order to avoid having their hospitals taken over?

Most importantly, how much money does the Leader of the Opposition expect to save by ending duplication? How much money will he save and how many staff does he expect will be made redundant?

I know what I am talking about because I have thought this through in a way that members opposite have not. Unless they can come up with the detail on how this might happen, they will be exposed as complete and utter frauds, phoneys and charlatans who are more interested in a headline than a health service.
