        On Saturday, the Southport Yacht Club welcomed Mr Bill Hatfield as he claimed the world record for the oldest person to circumnavigate the globe nonstop and unassisted. His west-about voyage began on 8 June, on board his Northshore 36 yacht,
        <i>
         L'eau Commotion
        </i>
        , sailing to the south of Africa and hugging the coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
         South America
        </a>
        . His final leg home was across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Ocean
        </a>
        towards the Australian coastline, after eight months at sea. Bill celebrated his 81st birthday on board his vessel on 14 January and he completed the voyage in 259 days, on his fourth attempt. The previous record was set just last year by British woman Jeanne Socrates, 77, who completed her journey in 320 days, in September 2019.

        Bill had several harrowing experiences during his journey, which we chatted about on Saturday, including a fall overboard 225 miles south-east of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helena" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which is in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Atlantic Ocean
        </a>
        between Africa and South America. In his blog, Bill recounts the endless tasks and repair jobs, and the constant changing conditions to which a sailor must adapt his vessel. It was a privilege to accompany him during the final hours of his journey on Saturday, cheering him from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Seaway" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast Seaway
        </a>
        , with past and present commodores and the Vice Commodore of the Southport Yacht Club. This is no doubt an incredible achievement by Mr Hatfield. He is an extraordinary human being who did not give up. His story is truly inspirational to sailors around the globe and demonstrates that age is not a barrier.
