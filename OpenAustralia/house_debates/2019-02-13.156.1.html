        Today marks the launch of the Youth Insearch Blue Heart campaign. For those not aware: Youth Insearch is a multi-award-winning charity organisation dedicated to helping young people through peer group support. Founded in 1985, Youth Insearch has helped over 31,000 youth turn their lives around, including thousands at risk of suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Assistant Minister for Children and Families, I have had the privilege of engaging with stakeholders across the country, including organisations that are working to address the many issues that our young people face on a day-to-day basis, whether it be trauma, family separation, loneliness, alcohol and drug addiction or anxiety. The work undertaken in the early intervention and prevention space is vital to keeping Australia's youth free from harm.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is alarming to learn that youth suicide is the biggest killer of young Australians and, tragically, is at the highest level it has been for over a decade. Not a single suicide of a child should happen. More work needs to be done to reduce this horrifying statistic, and Youth Insearch is doing just that. In 2018, there were over 1,000 attendances in the Youth Insearch program. Of these, 60 per cent were feeling suicidal and 44 per cent had attempted suicide. Thankfully, 75 per cent were no longer suicidal after participation, with all receiving ongoing follow-up support.
       </p>
       <p>
        One such Youth Insearch participant is Megan. Megan says, 'A few years ago, I never saw myself making it to my 18th birthday. I was sexually abused and have been through a lot of grief and was bullied most of my life. I was self-harming every day for years. But I haven't cut in more than six months, thanks to Youth Insearch. Every camp I go on, my trust and support for others grow. The love for myself rises. I am so proud of how far I have come and I have Youth Insearch to thank.' Megan's story is just one of many.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youth Insearch's Blue Heart campaign aims to create awareness and equip young people and those around them to talk about how they are feeling and to reach out for help. Our youth are our future and we must do all that we can here in this place to ensure we are supporting programs that are evidence based and combat the biggest killer of young Australians. I commend the work that Youth Insearch is doing to prevent youth suicide and I implore everyone who hears this speech to support this campaign. Let's spread hope, one heart at a time.
