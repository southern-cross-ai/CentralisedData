       <p>
        I rise in recognition of Mental Health Week, which starts today, and to highlight the important work that is undertaken by individuals and organisations within my electorate of Dawson.
       </p>
       <p>
        After extensive lobbying to get a headspace youth mental health centre in Mackay, that facility is now up and running and supporting young people in our community. But headspace on its own is not enough, and I want to acknowledge important volunteer organisations that have tackled this difficult issue with genuine commitment and compassion—organisations like the Grapevine Group in Mackay and CORES Queensland in the Burdekin region and elsewhere. They have built strong links and support networks in the communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In those major centres, we now have suicide prevention networks that draw together the different local groups and stakeholders with a view to uniting and coordinating their efforts. In addition, the Liberal-National government has committed $24 million over three years to fund a further eight suicide prevention regional trial sites, which will bring the total to 12. I am pleased to see that two of those new sites have been determined, and one of those is going to be Townsville—again, in my electorate, which takes in a lot of the suburbs of Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must now make the most of this opportunity by highlighting services available and encouraging friends and families with mental health issues to seek support. It is important for all of us, whatever our background, whatever our age and whatever our circumstances, to help each other identify mental health issues and seek support.
