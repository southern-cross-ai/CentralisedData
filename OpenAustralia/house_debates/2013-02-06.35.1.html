        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate a superstar from my electorate who is a true gentleman both in and out of the sporting arena.

        The whole Macarthur community was behind him—be it in our local pubs and clubs or at home watching on television. Danny lives in

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeaton_Grange" rel="nofollow">

        where he also mentors lots of local amateur boxers each week.

        Before the fight, I was very proud to chat with Daniel at the Camden Australia Day celebrations, where he was presented the keys to the town. It is the first time anyone has been presented with such an honour and Daniel is a very worthy recipient. He is a true gentleman who values good sportsmanship and loves fighting for his community and his country. Daniel also supports a lot of local charities and sets a great example for all the young people in Macarthur.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the hype surrounding the fight, Daniel refused to miss his daughter Lilyarna's first day of kindergarten the next morning. Fantastic! He said he loved being there for his kids and wouldn't miss it for the world. Daniel is not only a true sporting champion, but a nice guy and a loving dad who doesn't let fame or success go to his head and always puts his family first. Today I would simply like to bring to the attention of the House this fantastic achievement by a fine young man. Macarthur is very proud of you, Daniel, and we know you will continue to make us proud for many years to come. You are an absolute champion, mate. Good on you. You are the world's best.
