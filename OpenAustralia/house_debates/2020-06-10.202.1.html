       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight Townsville's amazing volunteers. We in this place know that volunteers are the heart and soul of our communities, so from 18 to 24 May we celebrated National Volunteer Week in the electorate of Herbert by notifying local groups of volunteer grant funding and presenting volunteers with their official certificates of appreciation. There were 16 volunteer groups in my electorate who received a share of more than $63,000 worth of funds as part of the government's Volunteer Grants program. This is an excellent program which provides vital equipment and fuel, and covers the cost of compulsory training to keep our local volunteers going.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was great to get down to the Arcadian Surf Life Saving Club, meet with Amy and the crew and let them know that they'd been successful in their grant. The club members provide lifeguard services on 'Maggie Island' and the mainland on a volunteer basis on weekends and they also run a great nippers program, encouraging kids into the sport. They'll use their grant for a much-needed and long-awaited computer system to track their members.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also popped into Triple T Community Radio to let the station manager, Tee Johnson, know they'd been successful. The station's volunteers do an excellent job in keeping Townsville informed and entertained on the radio waves, but they've been battling with an eight-year-old computer in desperate need of replacement. Their grant will purchase a new one to keep them on air for many, many years to come. Also, I put the call out to the community to nominate great volunteers to receive the Australian Government Certificate of Appreciation for Volunteers for all the hard work that they do.

        </a>
        . Dorelle turned 90 this year, but that hasn't stopped her volunteering and giving all the kids a stamp as they walk in. John not only volunteers at Reef HQ but also helps the coastguard, and he's been doing it for 45 years. It was a pleasure to meet with them and present them with their certificates as the sharks swam overhead in the predator tank.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also great to meet Tricia and David Hatfield who coordinate the Community Food Pantry in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End" rel="nofollow">
         West End
        </a>
        . This service caters to many in the community who are doing it tough. We know that, throughout the COVID-19 process, these volunteer groups have been the backbone of our community, and providing this food service has gone a long way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to congratulate Robert Mara, who, despite having lost his leg, is probably the most helpful man around the Townsville Men's Shed. He is described by fellow members as the 'Eveready battery' of the Men's Shed and was deserving of this recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to everyone who was nominated. I'd like to thank you for your service to our community.
