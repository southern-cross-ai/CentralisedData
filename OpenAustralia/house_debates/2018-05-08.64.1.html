         I'd like to thank the member for Tangney for his question. Like members on both sides, he understands the important role that the National Redress Scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse will play in acknowledging, supporting and providing financial assistance to people who experienced sexual abuse. The government is committed to establishing a national scheme to ensure fair and consistent treatment for all survivors. On 9 March this year, both
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Victoria announced with the Prime Minister at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirribilli_House" rel="nofollow">
          Kirribilli House
         </a>
         that they were opting into the scheme. At that meeting the Prime Minister also announced that there would be a national apology later in the year, and I'm sure that's something all members of this House welcome. Since then, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         and Queensland have opted in, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         is very close. Productive discussions with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and Tasmania continue. I have also had a number of very constructive consultations with non-government institutions, and I am confident that we will achieve a truly national scheme that provides redress right across the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The path is clear. Last week New South Wales introduced its referral legislation, and later this week the national bill will be introduced into the House. With the will of this parliament, the redress scheme will start on 1 July this year and offer access to psychological counselling, a direct personal response from the responsible institution, and a monetary payment. In addition, the government will be establishing community based support services to support survivors during the redress application process. Survivors will also have access to free specialised legal support services. The time for survivors to wait is hopefully over. We will continue to work with the remaining governments and non-government institutions to ensure the redress scheme is truly national. Survivors deserve nothing less. I know that I speak for all members of this parliament when I say to those survivors—and I met with a group of them yesterday—that all of us in this place want to do all we can to make sure that they get the redress that they deserve.
