        On 20 November last year I attended a public meeting at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSM" rel="nofollow">
         RSM
        </a>
        Club in Casino in relation to the impending sale of the Casino drill hall. It was due to be auctioned three weeks later, on 10 December. The community at large were unaware it was going to be sold until the signs went up a few weeks prior to that public meeting. Over 200 people at the meeting asked very specifically for me to have the sale stopped to see if the community could get together to purchase it so that it could remain in community hands. I immediately went to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Chester" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who was in charge of selling this. I asked him to defer the sale. After some negotiation where I explained to him the importance as well as the historical and cultural significance of the building, he gave the community six months to get back to him with a proposal.

        I can happily say that the community of Casino has rallied. The
