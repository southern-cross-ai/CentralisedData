        Yesterday a litany of government speakers, in defence of the corporate sector—which means its financial trusts—and against the interests of charities in this country, cited the figure that there are 600,000 not-for-profits in this country. Today, the day before the Werriwa volunteers awards, I want to talk about some of the people involved in the sector in my electorate. I cannot, of course, name the winners tomorrow, but I would mention these people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sister Patricia Murphy, of the Catholic order known as the Brown Sisters, has resided in Minto, a largely housing department suburb, for the past 25 years and has always been there to provide support for families in need in times of financial and emotional stress. I am pleased to see also that, in the redevelopment of that suburb with mixed housing usage for the future, she has accepted a residence in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jacqui Kirkby, an owner of the historic Varroville estate, has been a long-term campaigner against Sydney's only proposal in an urban area for coal seam gas. She is also on the Community Consultative Committee for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGL" rel="nofollow">
         AGL
        </a>
        but, more importantly, in recent months has taken a lead against the deplorable move by the Catholic cemeteries trust for a massive development in an area previously known as the Scenic Hills. This is the thin end of the wedge to undermine that recreational scenic area for further corporate development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bangalay Senior Citizens Group—more particularly Gail Holt and Jan Wardrop from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Fields" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Fields
        </a>
        —provide facilities for older residents over three days each week: Mondays are meeting days; Wednesdays are craft, morning tea and lunch, bringing together seniors on a social level to enjoy each other's company; and on Friday nights they provide movies. They also provide a service of welcoming new residents into the Macquarie Fields suburb. Relocations are often very difficult, as people lose touch with prior families and friends. Macquarie Fields is a suburb that in the past has had significant challenges, so that is a very important service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Christine Frame, also from Macquarie Fields, has been active on a variety of fronts. She has helped form the Liverpool Hospital Society Colonial Club to help raise needed funds for the hospital, which will soon be the largest in the

         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        . She has also been involved with the South Western Sydney

         TPI
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , helping disabled veterans, and the Liverpool Quilters, and she is President of the Ingleburn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Women's Auxiliary, helping raise funds for the Cancer Council and the Ingham research centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Laurel Todd, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Norton" rel="nofollow">
         Chipping Norton
        </a>
        just outside the electorate—but active within it—has been working as a volunteer driver for Meals on Wheels delivery since 1995. She obviously has helped many frail aged and disadvantaged and their carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denham_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Denham Court
        </a>
        Association, and more particularly Lyndell Painter, have taken a leading role over the last year in resistance to the move to widen and expand Campbelltown Road. The particular area it goes through is one of the remaining idyllic semirural areas of Sydney, and this measure is strongly resisted by residents of Denham Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Youth Solutions Board—the whole committee there—focuses on youth drug and alcohol prevention and health promotion. This service aims to empower young people, promote safer choices and build a stronger community through its activities and projects. I very much congratulate its endeavours and its success in recent years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dulcie Davis from Leppington is the President of the Liverpool Legacy Widows Club and the Liverpool War Widows. At 84 years of age, her effort in helping local widows is extremely commendable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suzanne Burton, also from Denham Court, volunteers with Liverpool Meals on Wheels as a driver. She has been with the organisation for 35 years and also assists with the Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation and HammondCare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally on this front, I want to recognise the work of our Anzac committee:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Foster" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Foster
        </a>
        , Wal Glynn, Ray James, David Beddie, Learna Coupe,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Brown
        </a>
        and, from my staff, Vicki Meadows. The meetings that they have had over the last year have often been dealing with difficult analysis and conclusions by the federal department to try to push through local grants. They have succeeded in regard to a granite fixture at the Wall of Remembrance at the Ingleburn RSL club; the engraving of the RSL
        <i>
         Ode
        </i>
        on black granite and its installation at the memorial gardens; a gala day incorporating a

        </a>
        performance by Army units and the Australian Army Band; financing a memorial at Casula High School; and the

         Casula Powerhouse

        , one of Western Sydney's major cultural outlets. So I commend that committee for the work it has done on a voluntary basis over the last year.
