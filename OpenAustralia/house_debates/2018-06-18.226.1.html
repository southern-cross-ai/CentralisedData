        I rise today to acknowledge and place on record the dedication and selflessness of 11-year-old Ashton Brown, who is in year 6 at

        college in Goodna. After learning about the struggles of homelessness people in his community, Ashton decided to do something about it. Aged only nine years at the time, Ashton started his own charity, Homeless Helpers, and has since raised thousands of dollars to help provide comfort to those doing it tough. Among many achievements, the charity has run signature local events such as a car wash and a motorbike ride across Brisbane, where more than 100 riders took place. On top of this, Ashton spends hours in his home kitchen cooking meals to hand out to the needy. Ashton still finds time to play soccer for local Richlands under-11 team, but his passion for helping those less fortunate is something his mother, Jacqui, is immensely proud of. Just last week, Jacqui was elected president of Homeless Helpers as Ashton is currently too young to hold any formal positionsâ€”not that that will stop him from leading the charge on this worthwhile cause. Ashton has big plans for Homeless Helpers, including the purchase of a caravan to be known as Homeless Helpers Happy Place, and would eventually like to run his own refuge house. It's young people like Ashton who act as outstanding role models not only for other young people but for all of us in the wider community. I commend Ashton for his incredible initiative and effort to date, and I wish him all the best for future successes with Homeless Helpers.
