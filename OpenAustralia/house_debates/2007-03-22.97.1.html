        ’s editorial on the Prime Minister’s $10 billion national water plan on 26 February this year. The editorial went on to further point out that the states have made a real mess of the Murray-Darling Basin. This is particularly true of the last 30 years. It has been ineffective because each state could exercise a veto power. The national interest was the first casualty. The problem with the Murray-Darling river system is easily identified: too much water given to irrigators. The solution is also easily identified: buy back the licences and stop the overallocation—but doing it is much harder.

        ’s plan to buy back licences from irrigators to reduce demand, increase water use efficiency and cut water by improving the infrastructure of irrigation is not a perfect plan. However, it does represent a turning point in environmental and constitutional politics, as was pointed out by

        Premier Morris Iemma, whose government could not afford to buy back the licences and the overallocation of water his state has allowed, realised immediately that his state had to agree to the proposal.

        However, to the credit of the leaders of these states, some sensible concessions were gained from the Commonwealth without compromising the national management of the rivers. A panel of five experts, to be appointed for their expertise rather than on state loyalty, is a sensible move, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rann" rel="nofollow">

        of South Australia should be congratulated for putting that idea forward and having it accepted. Mr Bracks and Victoria have not come on board; however, despite all the huff and puff, they will. The national plan is only at a raw beginning stage. A mass of details has to be resolved before the plan can become a reality. This is a real chance for cooperation and national interest to be front and centre instead of petty state jealousies and a blame game with the Commonwealth. Canberra’s money is most welcome; however, it will take a tremendous amount of goodwill for the plan to be a success. But a success it must be for the sake of all Australians.

        Whilst on the issue of water, it is disappointing that other aspects of the water debate are so intellectually shallow. I refer of course to the up to $1 billion desalination plants being planned and built in New South Wales,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and South Australia and to the building of weirs near the mouths of rivers, while ignoring stormwater conservation and the recycling of water. This will prove particularly disappointing if the Cheltenham racecourse—the last significant open space in Adelaide—is sold for a housing and retail development and to secure a car-racing track and grandstand infrastructure at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">

        . A stand for the grand! There is no public seating—not one public seat for  a $55 million taxpayer investment of public funding.
