        As many will know in this place, and in my electorate of Hindmarsh, I am a keen tennis player and I love being on the court. I am privileged to call the member for Bennelong, and Australian tennis great,

        , a hitting partner and also coach when I get a spare minute to play in Canberra and early in the morning during sitting weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hindmarsh is home to many great local tennis clubs, and over the years I have thoroughly enjoyed having a competitive game or a social hit with some of the following clubs in my electorate: Ascot Park Vermont Tennis Club, Glenlea Tennis Club in Novar Gardens, Grange Lawn Tennis Club, Henley South, Mellor Park, Morphettville Park Tennis Club, Peake Gardens Riverside, Seaside,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Somerton Park
        </a>
        Tennis Club, South Park Holme, West Beach Tennis Centre and West Lakes Tennis Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clubs such as these are vitally important for so many reasons. They help our kids live a healthy and active lifestyle through sport and keep people of all ages active and involved in the community. Most recently, I enjoyed visiting and supporting a number of clubs, and I would like to thank Col Lawson of West Lakes Tennis Club, Dave Coughlin of Seaside Tennis Club and Kerry Dempsey of Somerton Park for their hospitality and cooperation in working with their clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise and congratulate two local tennis clubs in my electorate that are celebrating some significant milestones in 2016. Congratulations go to Glenlea Tennis Club at Novar Gardens, which is celebrating a massive milestone of 100 years. Founded on 1 January 1916 and based in Novar Gardens, I am proud to have played a number of seasons there and to support the Glenlea Tennis Club as their club patron. I recently enjoyed their gala dinner with my wife, who is also a club member, and heard stories of their history over one hundred years. Well done to all of those involved in this special event, especially president, Bryan Sellick, and Julie Kimber,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Downs" rel="nofollow">

        and all the others on a fabulous centenary celebration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another club also celebrating a milestone in 2016 is the Grange Lawn Tennis Club. Founded in 1940, the club is celebrating its 75th season and I would like to congratulate the club on this significant achievement. I was pleased to visit the club last weekend and enjoyed discussing all things tennis with many of the members and seeing some fine tennis played on the grass courts and hard courts. Thanks to members of the club: Ursula Gregg; president, Andrew Gates; coach David Grainger; Kim Williams and a number of other members for stopping to have a chat. I wish them the best for the finish of the season.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also keen to assist local tennis clubs and sporting organisations in Hindmarsh whenever I can. I am a proud sponsor of many clubs and enjoy attending their presentation ceremonies or end-of-season events where I often donate a trophy or a raffle prize. Local clubs often need funding support for courts or facilities, whether it be sporting clubs such as the Plympton Sports and Recreation Club or the Seaton Ramblers. They have received government assistance. Round 2 of the Stronger Communities Program is currently open, so I urge all sporting clubs to contact my office if they have not already.
