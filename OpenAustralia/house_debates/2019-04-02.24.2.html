       <p>
        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei, 15 to 25 July 2018, and ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I shall keep my remarks very short. I'm aware there are time constraints on the House this week. Suffice to say that we were welcomed by the three countries we visited: Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei. We were warmly welcomed, I must say, with all making it very clear that they value our friendship and valued the delegation, and that was very rewarding in itself. I must make a special note of Thailand, where it was obvious that our now Australians of the Year, Dr Richard Harris and Dr Craig Challen, are possibly even more famous there than they are here for their role in the rescue of the boys from the cave in Thailand.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank the other members of the delegation: the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Bruce; the member for Moore and Senator O'Sullivan. I'd particularly like to thank our delegation secretary, chaperone and drafter of the chair's report, Michelle Brennan from the Parliamentary Library, for her capable assistance. To our embassies in Vietnam and Thailand and the high commission in Brunei, I extend the delegation's thanks. They were more than professional. They were absolutely on top of their task, and I congratulate them.
