       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        I am thankful for this opportunity to acknowledge the significant role that police officers play in our community, and the great deal of risk and sacrifice that comes with the job. I felt compelled to raise the awareness of National Police Remembrance Day because I proudly served my community as a police officer for 25 years. I know what it is like to leave your family at home each day to go out and protect other families in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year on 29 September thousands of people across Australia stop to pay tribute to the brave members of the police force who have lost their lives in the line of duty and to offer support to their grieving families.
       </p>
       <p>
        The camaraderie in the police force is second to none. That is why so many police officers and former members of the police force stop to remember their fallen comrades on 29 September. A death within the police force is a solemn reminder of the dangers our police face and the risks they must take every time they go to work to keep our communities safe. When an officer is killed in the line of duty, there is no telling how many police officers are affected from all over Australia. Many officers will reconsider the risks they take every day and the family members they would leave behind if something were to go wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent months, the dangers faced by members of our police force have only escalated. The risks faced by our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        officers and Customs officials are becoming higher due to what is happening around the world and the possible threat to Australian citizens. The AFP continues to be concerned by the increasing risk of home-grown terrorists and the lone wolf/lone actor threat. This threat is intensified by the growth in self-radicalisation which is facilitated by new communication tools. We also have the joint counter-terrorism teams in each jurisdiction, comprising AFP, state and territory police,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Security Intelligence Organisation
        </a>
        officers and members from other relevant agencies. The teams conduct investigations to prevent, respond to and investigate terrorist threats and attacks in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I join the many people in the Macarthur electorate who have the utmost respect and admiration for members of the police force. These men and women take great risks every time they go out to work and they deserve much respect from the community for risking their lives to protect others. Macarthur has more than 300 police officers working in the Camden and Campbelltown local area commands, serving the local community. These men and women work very hard to fight crime and keep our residents safe. These officers serve our community with great integrity and honour. I hope that one day everyone will appreciate the sacrifices they make and the risks they take to protect us. It is not an easy job to do, and far too many officers have made the ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives doing it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless you have worked in the police force or have a family member who does, it is hard to comprehend the dangers these men and women put themselves in every day to keep the community safe. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        alone, we have lost more than 240 police officers in the line of duty since August 1803, through a variety of causes. These include being shot by bushrangers, drowning while crossing a creek, being shot by an offender, being assaulted, and through injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents during pursuits. No matter how they died, it is terribly sad when men and women who have dedicated their lives protecting others are killed in the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would also like to pay tribute to the Police Legacy organisations across the country. Police Legacy is a not-for-profit organisation which provides emotional and financial support to the widows and children of deceased police officers. I would like to acknowledge the good work of the Police Legacy organisation that looked after the remaining loved ones of police officers who have been killed in the line of duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        My heart goes out to the families of all police officers who have lost their lives. I offer my heartfelt condolences. I believe it is important that we in this House continue to express our gratitude and reaffirm our support for the nation's 56,000 police officers, whose dedication and commitment ensure continuous peace and safety across our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank all my colleagues from both sides of the House who have come together to support our fine police men and women in this place today. I am looking forward to the contributions from the member for Solomon, whose husband, Paul, is a serving police officer in the

          Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. On 29 September I had the pleasure of attending a dusk service hosted by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Federal Police
          </a>
          to commemorate all of those officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and to salute the courage of all those who wear a police uniform.
         </p>
         <p>
          The dusk service was held at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
           National Police Memorial
          </a>
          , which was officially opened in Canberra on 29 September 2006. This memorial pays tribute to Australian police officers who have been killed on duty or who have died as a result of their duties since the advent of policing in Australia. Importantly, the memorial recognises the unique nature of police service and the dangers that police face in the doing of their daily duties. Officers of our law enforcement agencies put their lives on the line to protect our communities every day. National Police Remembrance Day is a time to acknowledge the men and women of our law enforcement agencies who put their lives on the line to protect our communities, to secure our way of life and to ensure that we live safely today.
         </p>
         <p>
          In my electorate of Batman, police at Northcote Police Station were unanimous in their decision to honour the late Sergeant Brian Kilmartin with the Breavington Award, which was presented to his widow, Andrea, and sons Joshua and James, after a ceremony at All Nations Park War Memorial on 10 September this year. Sergeant Kilmartin was known for quietly going beyond the call of duty and it was apt that his service to the community was recognised. Northcote Police Senior Sergeant David Yates described the late Sergeant Kilmartin as a 'dedicated, kind and caring police officer'.
         </p>
         <p>

          , after escaping from a prison camp where thousands of allies were held. Acts of courage and strength characterised his last months. In Fairfield where he lived with his wife Margaret, there is a place called Breavington Park, with a playground, a memorial fountain and a plaque, saying he was described by his commanding officer as the 'bravest man he had ever seen'.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fortunately this year no Australian police officers were killed while on duty, but we will never forget and eternally honour the 757 Australian officers who have paid the supreme sacrifice. It is also important to remember the remaining loved ones of those killed on duty.
         </p>

          Police Legacy started in 1971 when the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Queensland Police
          </a>
          Legacy was established. Today, the Queensland Police Legacy is an independent charitable organisation that aims to assist the families of all deceased police officers as well as the dependant children of terminally ill officers or officers who have lost a spouse. Since 1971 every Australian state and territory jurisdiction has created a Police Legacy of its own. Each Police Legacy essentially asks a number of questions, including what the officer who died would have wanted for their family and what opportunities they would have tried to give their children.

          groups try to provide ongoing support to the families of police officers, and much of this work is done by volunteer staff.
         </p>
         <p>
          I take this opportunity to thank and commend all of those who serve in our law enforcement agencies and also their families and friends who support them in their duties.

          <p>
           Firstly, I acknowledge the presentations by the member for Macarthur and the member for Batman, for their spirited responses to this National Police Remembrance Day. I also went to Inverloch on 29 September, along with a whole band of the community, representing the federal government with regard to what police officers do.
          </p>
          <p>
           The point I would like to make is that, unlike the member for Macarthur, I cannot identify with what a policeman goes through in their daily activities—he said he left his family in the mornings in the full knowledge of what was ahead in the day but also having no idea of what was ahead in the day. We do not live that life—although perhaps we do in some ways: we have no idea what is going to come next! But there is only a handful of people—five people, as the member for Macarthur point out—who really understand what it is like to be a serving police officer. They are serving in this House today, or their parents were, or their husbands are or they have some direct connection to that. They understand.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, having said that, that does not mean we cannot—local, state and federal governments—enter into the remembrance day activities, which we all did. And I have done so for a long time—especially on award presentation days—just to recognise that which policemen and policewomen do in our communities. Quite often, they have a greater influence on young people than we ever envisage or realise. They are an inspiration: the lives that they lead and the pressures they are under are like those of the rest of us, but with that overarching responsibility they are given for our protection every day.
          </p>
          <p>
           This motion presented by the member for Macarthur and seconded by the member for Batman:
          </p>
          <p>
           You have heard the resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
           In my electorate, the selfless sacrifice of police officer Varli Blake stands out as a shining example of a young woman who gave her all for the job and who paid a very heavy price. Varli, who was a favourite netballer at Meeniyan Dumbalk United, and a student at Leongatha's St Laurence O'Toole's Primary School and Leongatha Secondary College, was seriously injured earlier this year when an explosion occurred in a flat in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Park" rel="nofollow">
            Middle Park
           </a>
           after a leaking gas bottle ignited. Despite her ongoing rehabilitation, she could not wait to get back to work, calling hers 'the best job in the world'. Varli was not the only officer injured in the explosion. Sergeant Tony Scully and First Constable Emma Quick also suffered extensive injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
           A number of things have made Varli's journey remarkable. Aside from the resilience of a woman who suffered burns to 32.5 per cent of her body and who has endured extremely painful operations, countless physiotherapy sessions, speech therapy and any number of other obstacles on her way towards recovery, the resilience of the police force and the community that have rallied around her has also been part of the story and an inspiration to all.
          </p>
          <p>
           What Varli's story says to me is how much the community values the contribution of our force and how worthy the force is to have a day in honour of those whose dedication and commitment ensure continuous peace and safety across our communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, the local police force back their own, as members in the House would understand, raising money to help her recovery. But the local communities in my electorate of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
            McMillan
           </a>
           have been just as keen to put their hands in their pockets to help, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. I believe that this is a testimony to what police and the job that they do mean to many.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are few occupations where a real threat is faced every day, with absolute nil knowledge of what they may be walking into. That flat in Melbourne was just a routine event for these police officers. The person in the flat was known to them and they went in. And yet, the way the police force has rallied around these three has been magnificent. I would like to say to them, 'You are on our minds all the time.' We wish them a speedy recovery and want them to know that one day, with all those injuries, they will return to work. They will return to the Victorian police force, where they obviously have great dedication. But I could understand if they said, 'That's enough.'

            . I want to reflect on the death of a very brave young man—and this was a matter raised during the commemorations this year in the Northern Territory—the death of Sergeant Glen Huitson, a man I knew. He died in a very sad event in 1999. He was at that time part of the two-man
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_River" rel="nofollow">
             Adelaide River
            </a>
            Station, 114 kilometres south of Darwin. He lived with his wife, Lisa, and their young children, Joseph and Ruby.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Constable Jamie
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Brien" rel="nofollow">
             O'Brien
            </a>
            , his fellow officer at Adelaide River:
           </p>
           <p>
            As police officers in remote stations, Sergeant Huitson and Constable O'Brien were both mindful of being a long way from other police and support. On 3 August 1999 Sergeant Huitson and Constable O'Brien were already tired after attending a car crash the previous night when they were called to set up a road block on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway" rel="nofollow">
             Stuart Highway
            </a>
            , in the early hours of the morning, north of Adelaide River. At around 10.30 am Sergeant Huitson and Constable O'Brien were shot at in an ambush. Constable O'Brien and Sergeant Huitson exchanged fire with the gunman from their position behind the police car at the roadblock. Sergeant Huitson was hit, causing grave internal injuries, and was killed. Constable O'Brien continued to fire at the gunman and as backup police arrived the gunman was ultimately killed himself. Constable O'Brien immediately ran to his dying colleague. Sergeant Huitson was pronounced dead soon after arrival at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Darwin Hospital
            </a>
            . The memorial at Adelaide River for Sergeant Huitson says that he was 'an integral part of community life' and that his untimely death left a gap in the community 'which will never be filled'. Of course, that is a gap that will never be filled in the lives of his family—his wife and his two wonderful children.
           </p>
           <p>
            It gives us cause to think, as the previous member who spoke said, about the importance of acknowledging the dangerous role police perform in our community. They do not know what is going to happen once they walk out of that door at home to go to work. Anything could happen. I have had a lot to do with police over the years, and more recently with young police officers who are doing what I think is a bit of a sad job, in a way—standing outside of liquor outlets in the Northern Territory, and Alice springs in particular, where they have made a dramatic difference in the incidence of alcohol fuelled violence around the town. I think there should be other ways to do that. Nevertheless, I always stop and talk to the young coppers, just to say, 'G'day, how are you; what are you doing?' And I am constantly amazed by their dedication to the job, however menial or boring it might be at that particular time, and their commitment to making a difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is true across the police force, in all categories of policing. So I want to use this occasion to thank the Northern Territory police in particular, but also the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Federal Police
            </a>
            , and the state police in the other jurisdictions, for the wonderful work they do. I know sometimes they get a bad rap, but let me say this: I could not imagine a more difficult job, particularly in the circumstances of remote parts of northern Australia, where it is particularly isolated and things are very rough. It is hard on families and it is hard on the police. But they really are a dedicated bunch and they deserve to be commended as we acknowledge those who have lost their lives in the course of duty over the many years since the police forces were established.

             have been protecting our homes, families, businesses and communities. The New South Wales Police Force has grown from the first civilian police force in Australia, known as the

              Night Watch
             </a>
             , to one of the largest police organisations in the English-speaking world, with over 15½ police officers and around 4,000 civilian staff.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am fortunate to work with two local area commands in my role as the member for Dobell and two very impressive and dedicated local area commanders. Superintendent

              Daniel Sullivan
             </a>
             , Commander of the Brisbane Waters Local Area Command, advised me of the significance of the National Police Remembrance Day. He said: 'As police, we choose a role in our community knowing that one day we may have to pay the ultimate sacrifice of fulfilling our sacred oath of office. Our families, however, do not get that choice. They live with the real fear that every time we say goodbye before heading to work it could be the last time we ever say those words.' The Central Coast, tragically, has three names on the National Wall of Remembrance. This is why Superintendent Sullivan supports and participates in fundraising activities for New South Wales Police Legacy—including walking to Tamworth, cycling to Canberra and, most recently, paddling the Brisbane Waters—to help those who are left behind after an officer has fallen.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 29 September I had the honour of attending a memorial service to commemorate National Police Remembrance Day, which is observed in Australia,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>

              Solomon Islands
             </a>
             . I joined with current and retired members of the New South Wales Police Force at Wyong Anglican Church to honour officers who lost their lives while performing their duties. We also paid tribute to those members of the police force who have lost their lives through illness or other circumstances. Superintendent David Swilks, Commander of the Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command, said: 'This day is a solemn occasion where we take the opportunity to honour the selfless sacrifice of those who preceded us as well as those who have been our workmates.' Our local service was conducted by Reverend Dan Connor, New South Wales Police Chapman, Tuggerah Lakes
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAC" rel="nofollow">
              LAC
             </a>
             . He said: 'Professional policing is truly a noble vocation, a vocation that carries an inherent risk. We pause today to remember those fellow officers who gave their lives in their pursuit to bring justice to others. Their sacrifice was not in vain and will not be forgotten.' These words capture the significance of National Police Remembrance Day.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thankfully, in the past year no Australian police officer has lost their life on duty. However, we do pause to acknowledge the 757 officers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and the countless others who have been injured. Every day, our police men and women put on their uniform, leave their loved ones and go to work knowing the tremendous risks associated with their job. They do it for the love of the force and the love of their community.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wish to acknowledge and pay tribute to members of the Central Coast police force who have lost their lives in the line of duty: Detective Sergeant Richard Whittaker, who passed away on 28 September 1991; Senior Constable Christopher Thornton, who passed away on 13 April 2001; and Senior Constable Peter 'Gordie' Wilson, who passed away on 11 November 2006. On behalf of the Central Coast community I thank these officers for their service and sacrifice. My thoughts are with their families and friends who carry with them every day the hurt of losing a loved one—a father, a brother or a son—while they were going about their everyday job and dedicated service to their community.
            </p>
            <p>
             This motion also commends the outstanding work of Police Legacy, who dedicate their time to supporting police and their families particularly in times of tragedy and need. In New South Wales, Police Legacy provides care and support to over 20,000 serving and retired police officers. Police Legacy cares not only for families who are suffering from loss and grief but also for those experiencing misfortune who may require extra support.
            </p>
            <p>
             In closing, I acknowledge the members of the New South Wales police force for their commitment and dedication to keeping our community safe and protection us from those who fail to respect the law. I commend the outstanding dedication and commitment of all Australian police officers, and the support provided by civilian staff, for their service and contribution to protecting our community. I commend the motion to the House.

             <p>
              I had not intended to speak on this particular motion, but I commend the member for Macarthur for it. The reason I am speaking on the motion is to do with events that occurred in my electorate on Tuesday, 23 September, when we almost lost two police officers—an
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
               AFP
              </a>
              officer and a 'Vic Pol' officer. For me it absolutely drove home, in a very stark and brutal way, the difficulties that our fine men and women of the police force confront.
             </p>
             <p>
              The event I am referring to was the stabbing of two police officers, on the evening of 23 September, and the death of the young man who was involved. It is not for me to make comments about what actually occurred there that evening, because that is the subject of a coronial inquest and an internal review. But I did want to say of the very fine men and women of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_Hills" rel="nofollow">
               Endeavour Hills
              </a>
              police force that under incredible circumstances, in unprecedented circumstances, in a local suburban police station, one that was relatively busy but is not a 24-hour police station, two young officers almost lost their lives in the course of their duties.
             </p>
             <p>
              I often go to police functions and to police stations. There are three police stations servicing my area: Endeavour Hills,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren" rel="nofollow">
               Narre Warren
              </a>
              and Cranbourne police stations. When you meet with the young men and women, the senior sergeants and the force commanders, they will detail to you, as they have to me, the circumstances in which they find themselves. Often it will be attending an incident with domestic violence, where one of the officers gets injured as a consequence of their trying to intervene to protect a women or man who is being assaulted.
             </p>
             <p>
              When we see these people driving around in our electorates and walking the streets, we do not appreciate the sacrifices they make to keep our community save. On behalf of my community I want to thank them. In the horrible events of 23 September, we almost saw something occur that resulted in the loss of life of the two young police officers.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was my honour to go to the station on two occasions on the Friday after the event. Incidentally, on 29 September one of the senior sergeants had to go to the National Police Remembrance Days service. While at the station I was fortunate to meet with a lot of the young officers and even some of the cadets who were there. I am hoping that they see this speech at some time, because I wanted to say this to them: you did well; you did very well; you did brilliantly. To contain the scene that was described to me was, under the circumstances, a great testament to the skill and resolve of the officers involved. The scene that was described to me was a horrific one, a harrowing and horrible scene. But those young men and women rose to a terrible situation, and we should be very proud of what they did.
             </p>
             <p>
              I commend the member for Macarthur for raising this particular issue. I want to say to all of those young men and women and all the officers who serve my area that I will remember you. This is not a situation where I am going to walk into your police station and talk to you. I will be there for you, because it is clear to me from meeting the very brave young men and women who attended the scene that there was significant trauma there for the officers. That is something we do not speak about—the trauma they experience day in and day out that the community in a lot of ways takes for granted. We expect them to put their bodies and lives on the line—and they do—to keep us safe.
             </p>
             <p>
              On behalf of my community I thank you for what you do—for putting your lives at risk. We know what the costs are to their personal relationships and to their health and wellbeing. Again, coming back to the point that hit me most viscerally, these were young men and women who were experiencing this. Congratulations to them and also to the two young officers involved. I will not forget you. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Thank you for the work that you do for our community.

               Today it is a great honour to speak in support of this private member's motion, brought to the chamber by my good friend and neighbour in western Sydney, the member for Macarthur—an honourable member himself who has worn the blue uniform for 25 years, serving our community and protecting our community. And, to this day, he is still a fierce advocate for the people of western Sydney.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our police do the work that keeps us safe. They keep our families, homes and businesses safe. They look after our community. They are our guardians and often our custodians.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would like in particular today to thank the work of our local police in the Lindsay electorate, those from the Penrith and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's" rel="nofollow">
                St Mary's
               </a>
               local area commands. 29 September marked National Police Remembrance Day, a day we pause to honour police officers whose lives have been cut short while performing their duty. In this motion we also look at the work of Police Legacy that works with over 20,000 both retired and serving police.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since 1862, 252
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               police officers have lost their lives in the line of duty while protecting the lives and property of others—252 lives lost way too soon. These numbers and sacrifices of our police officers were brought home to me by a very good friend of mine Brendan Bunter. Brendan was in fact my oldest brother's best friend going through school and, like his father, followed his dad into the police force. He served our local communities, including Fairfield, St Mary's, Katoomba and Mudgee, rising to the rank of sergeant. Brendan went to domestic violence incidents, including one where in fact an offender tried to stab and kill Brendan. Brendan now suffers with acute post-traumatic stress disorder and has had to endure the mental anguish that goes with that. Brendan has tried to take his own life. Along with his wife, I have visited Brendan in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John" rel="nofollow">
                St John
               </a>
               of God. When speaking to Brendan today about this motion, he told me that he would like to tell you of the challenges and the journey that he had been on. Whilst we might remember the 252 lives lost, if Brendan had have been successful in taking his own life, he would not be counted in those numbers, even though the post-traumatic stress disorder that he has following this particular domestic violence incident, the numerous motor vehicle accidents that he attended, the investigations into fatalities and assisting families through suicide has left Brendan with a permanent disability.
              </p>
              <p>
               Brendan's wife is one of my very good friends and it is wonderful to see the support of the family. This is just one police officer; just think of the knock-on effect this has for all the other families. That is why this day of commemorating National Police Remembrance Day is so important. It is why it is important that we actually stop to remember and look at the sacrifices of all our local police officers. Once again, I have the opportunity here today to publicly put on the record and acknowledge the work of both Penrith and St Mary's local area commands.
              </p>
              <p>
               Friday also marked a very special day for Inspector Harry Goedings, who retired from the Penrith Local Area Command. Harry had served the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales Police Force
               </a>
               for 37 years and retires after a very long and distinguished career. On Friday he marched out of the Penrith station for the last time. He waved goodbye to his Penrith policing family, which I am sure he will be back to visit from time to time. Harry, I would like to thank you for your service, I would like to thank you for protecting our local community and I wish you all the best in your retirement.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would also like to thank all the current serving police officers for the remarkable job that they do in ensuring that there is peace and safety right across our community. I would like to thank the member for Macarthur for bringing this motion to the House.

               <p>
                I am very pleased to be speaking on this important motion. I commend the member for Macarthur for moving the motion, and note the contributions by previous members, all in support of our police services and recognising the National Police Remembrance Day.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am pleased to speak on this for a number of reasons. Firstly, as a former police officer, I always like to take the opportunity to commend the work of our police services across the nation. My husband is also a former police officer.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also want to take the opportunity to thank the local police in my electorate of Richmond—the Tweed-Byron Local Area Command—who do an incredible job, as we all know, under difficult circumstances. We have a growing area and a lot of very busy tourist spots. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone from the Tweed-Byron Local Area Command.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I said, I am a former police officer from Queensland, as is my husband. We were both in the

                 Queensland Police

                Service. I was in general duties; he was in the traffic branch. It is a really important year for the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
                 Queensland Police Service
                </a>
                because in 2014 they celebrate 150 years of policing in Queensland, so it is an opportunity to acknowledge that.
               </p>
               <p>
                As we turn to National Police Remembrance Day each year, 29 September holds a very special significant for police right throughout Australia,

                 Solomon Islands
                </a>
                . It is a day for police to pause and honour officers whose lives have been lost whilst performing their duties. It is also a day for the general community to pause and thank those who serve in the police services.
               </p>
               <p>
                National Police Remembrance Day was first held in September 1989 as a result of a joint decision at the 1988 Australasia and South West Pacific Region Commissioners’ Conference. It was a great decision to have this day. We see a number of police monuments through various states, and our national police monument well. It is wonderful to have that in place. It is located here in Canberra and was completed in 2006, with the names of 719 fallen officers inscribed on a wall of brass touchstones. The touchstones include the officers' ranks, names, jurisdictions, and places and dates of death. It is very important to have that national monument in place. Fortunately, this year no Australian police officer has been killed on duty. I think it is important to acknowledge that.
               </p>
               <p>
                In terms of the local commemorations, there was a very large event in my electorate. My electorate is on the border of Queensland and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                and at Twin Towns they held a joint event with the Queensland Police Service and the New South Wales Police Service, as they do every year. I think it is fantastic to have such a large event that involves both states. The
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
                 AFP
                </a>
                were present, as were retired police. I am very pleased that my husband, Craig, was able to represent me at this combined service.
               </p>
               <p>
                In fact, hundreds of police took part. They call it the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                 Gold Coast
                </a>
                -Tweed National Police Remembrance Day services. Officers from the border towns in both states marched and paraded through the streets to remember those 140 Queensland police officers and 252 police officers from New South Wales who have died on duty. They were all remembered in the very moving ceremony that many people attended. Of course, the thoughts of many of us are with the family of Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding, who was killed after responding to an armed robbery and hostage situation on the Gold Coast in May 2011.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would also like to touch on the great role that Legacy play—this is in the original motion as well—and to acknowledge that right throughout the country they do an outstanding job. The mission statement of New South Wales Police Legacy is:
               </p>
               <p>
                The New South Wales organisation currently provides support for more than 1,300 police family members, caring for children as young as two, and some widows as old as 101. So that is a really remarkable achievement by Legacy. They also say on their website that their commitment is to build on the care and support of over 20,000 serving and retired police officers and their families during times of tragedy and need. They also say on their website:
               </p>
               <p>
                Legacy New South Wales provides an outstanding array of support, from education grants to providing funding and counselling. They do an outstanding job.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I said, I was very pleased to be able to speak on this motion in relation to National Police Remembrance Day. It is an opportunity for all of us to remember the very difficult work that is involved with policing, and the sacrifices that have been made by so many as well. I would like to thank all of those police and their families, particularly of course those in my electorate and those in the Tweed-Byron Local Area Command but the police right throughout the country, and their families as well.

                 I would like to say to the member for Richmond that that was a mammoth task getting all that recorded. This morning I rise to support the motion of my good friend and colleague, the member for Macarthur. As a former police officer, he knows only too well the risks and sacrifices that our police officers face every day in their duty of protecting our communities. On Monday, 29 September, I was one of the many Australians who paused to reflect on the selflessness and bravery of our police men and women and, importantly, their loved ones. Along with many other members of the Darwin and Palmerston communities, I attended a service in Darwin to remember the service, dedication and sacrifice of our dedicated police officers. The date 3 August 1999 is still fresh in the minds of many Territorians, who will always remember the ultimate sacrifice made by Glen Huitson—

                    Saint Michael
                   </a>
                   's Day, Saint Michael being the patron saint of law enforcement and, according to Christian tradition, the protector of good over evil. Since 1989, it has been one of the most significant days on the national police calendar. It is a time when we pause and honour lives and the memories of some very fine men and women whose lives were drastically cut short in the line of duty. But National Police Remembrance Day is also a significant opportunity not only for police but also for the general community to reflect upon the invaluable service rendered by our police officers and to express our gratitude for the significant work they do on behalf of our respective communities. We all know that policing comes with a very high degree of risk that thankfully most of us will never have to face. It truly takes a special type of person with a special type of courage to wear the police uniform. We are truly indebted to the men and women who choose to do so. The bravery and courage of our police men and women and their dedication to serving and protecting our communities should never be taken for granted. We are forever in their debt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   On National Police Remembrance Day we also think of the loved ones left behind, whose lives have been affected forever. We owe it to the fallen to ensure that their families are well protected and provided for. I know Police Legacy, particularly in New South Wales, where I come from, does a splendid job. I also know that it is replicated in each of the other states and territories.

                   This ride is a major charity fundraising event. The funds raised will go towards Police Legacy, who support the families of officers who have been killed on duty. It was a most successful event and, as a result of this year's ride, the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Federation_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   will be donating over $100,000 to the Police Legacy fund. This brings the total amount of donations by the Police Federation of Australia to Police Legacy since the inaugural ride to over $400,000. I think that shows the amount of support to Police Legacy, who in turn ensure that young people and their families are provided for into the future. This was an opportunity for all of us to show not only our respect for those who have lost their lives in the service of their duty but also acknowledge the extraordinary contribution that police make day in and day out and to show our gratitude for their efforts on our behalf.
