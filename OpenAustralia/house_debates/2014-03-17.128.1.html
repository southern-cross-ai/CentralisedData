       <p>
        Earlier this month, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology released their biannual
        <i>
         State of the climate
        </i>
        report. The report provides data and trends relating to climate change and climate change observations. The CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology are two of Australia's most reputable government organisations. Their credibility is crucial to their existence. The report showed that, in line with climate science predictions, the atmosphere and oceans around Australia are warming. Indeed, last year was the warmest year on record. Notably, air temperatures across Australia were, on average, one degree centigrade warmer than they were a hundred years ago and sea surface temperatures had risen by 0.9 of a degree over the same period. Most of the temperature increases have occurred since 1950.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report also found that seven out of the 10 warmest years on record in Australia have occurred since 1998 and the frequency of very warm months has increased fivefold while the frequency of very cool months has decreased by around one third. These are serious changes to weather patterns and to our climate. It also found that the duration, frequency and intensity of heatwaves has increased across large parts of Australia since 1950.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are not extrapolations, theories, models or predictions but factual reports of how Australia's climate has changed over the last century. The temperature rises and changes to Australia's weather patterns are consistent with climate changes across the world, which show that: firstly, mean carbon dioxide levels reached 395 parts per million in 2013; secondly, global temperatures are rising, with most of the heat being absorbed by our oceans; thirdly, that sea levels have risen by about 225 millimetres since 1880 and that the ocean acidity levels have also risen over that time; and, fourthly, ice mass lost from the Antarctic and Greenland icesheets has accelerated over the past two decades, whilst Antarctic sea ice has slightly increased since 1979. All of these changes point towards more frequent and more extreme weather events precisely of the type that the world has experienced in recent years, confirming earlier predictions by climate scientists. Yet we continue to be subjected to a well-organised campaign by climate change sceptics—possibly funded by the fossil fuel industry—questioning the climate change science and being given too much prominence, I believe, by some sectors of the media.

        refers to a statement made by internationally renowned German scientist and founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, who said that the difference between two degrees Celsius of global warming and four degrees Celsius is human civilisation.

        Regrettably, that message is falling on the deaf ears of the Prime Minister and the Abbott government, who opportunistically prefer to use such a serious matter for political advantage rather than to live up to the responsibility that they are entrusted with.

       <p>
        Astonishingly, the Abbott government's white paper on agriculture makes no mention of climate change, even though climate change presents the sector with its greatest risks, as confirmed by reports in the media today. That refers to another CSIRO report that will be released very quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        In years to come, the Abbott government will be seen for what it is: a government that put financial greed ahead of moral and social responsibility, that placed political self-interest ahead of national interest and that sacrificed future generations by leaving them to deal with the consequences of today's inaction.

         Traineeships and apprenticeships play an important role in supporting our local economy and in providing a pathway to employment for school leavers. This government understands the need to build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. This means cutting the waste and restoring the budget to a sustainable surplus, supporting small business by removing unnecessary red and green tape to reduce compliance costs and, importantly for my electorate, providing more support to those undertaking traineeships and apprenticeships.

         there is a well-documented demand for traineeships and apprenticeships, with 26,400 people taking up a trade in the quarter ending December 2013. Unfortunately, national completion rates for traineeships and apprenticeships have fallen as low as 50 per cent. Given the significant economic cost, time and resources provided for traineeships and apprenticeships, we have to look at why this is occurring and address the problem by introducing effective and practical initiatives to lift completion rates. In Dobell, we face challenges in transitioning young adults from schooling to further education and potential employment.
        </p>
        <p>
         December's Labour Force Survey found that on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Central Coast
         </a>
         28 per cent of people aged between 15 and 19 years who are looking for full-time work cannot find a job. With only one in two students completing year 12 and only 14 per cent of people aged 17 to 22 years engaged in tertiary education, there is an increased need for access to well-supported traineeships and apprenticeships. In Dobell, we have some excellent local registered training organisations and group training organisations that provide support to our small businesses that are looking to take on a trainee or apprentice. In Dobell, the government has partnered with Central Coast Group Training and has committed $2.7 million towards the development of local employment and trade centres.
        </p>
        <p>
         The local demand for apprenticeships is highlighted by the 4,065 highly motivated and enthusiastic people who are currently seeking employment and training opportunities and are registered with Central Coast Group Training. Presently, Central Coast Group Training is only able to place 140 people a year. It is estimated that the government's partnership with Central Coast Group Training will enable further employment of over 200 apprentices and trainees directly.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the mother of two sons, I understand the challenges faced by the youth of the Central Coast to find employment and the pressure on the families who want opportunity for their children. This is why I am committed to programs and initiatives to support training and apprenticeships.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that employers seeking to engage a trainee or apprentice have access to support mechanisms that minimise the associated risks to their own businesses. Group training organisations support and assist host employers by minimising the administrative burden of taking on a trainee or apprentice. They do this by taking on the responsibility for the administrative and compliance aspects of engaging an apprentice or a trainee such as recruitment, workers compensation, payroll and administration, training requirements and work health and safety, just to name a few. Partnering with group training organisations to deliver greater outcomes for local communities through providing successful traineeships and apprenticeships is important if we are going to successfully provide opportunity for our youth. We also need to provide support to those seeking to undertake trades and the government will provide financial assistance through interest-free trade support loans of up to $20,000. This will assist apprentices to cover everyday costs associated with their apprenticeship. Trade support loans will be repayable at the same thresholds that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEE" rel="nofollow">
          FEE

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
          HELP
         </a>
         loans are for university students so that apprentices do not have to repay any money until they are earning a sustainable income. Apprentices who successfully complete their apprenticeships will receive an immediate 20 per cent discount on their trade support loans. This measure seeks to boost apprenticeship completion rates that, as previously highlighted, are at an unacceptable low.
        </p>
        <p>
         Learning a trade skill is invaluable to the individual, to the community and to our economy. Future productivity and competitiveness depend on a skilled and trained workforce; therefore, it is essential that we assist more young people to take up a trade career. I am proud to be part of a government that understands the importance of supporting traineeships and apprenticeships and the need to build a stronger and more prosperous economy so that everyone can get ahead.
