       <p>
        I thought I would bring the House up to date with my campaign for keeping the Belmont Medicare office open. The House may remember that the Howard government closed the Belmont Medicare office, Labor reopened the medical office in Belmont and—surprise, surprise—the Liberal Party is back in power and they are set to close the Belmont Medicare office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Saturday morning, I spent three hours outside Belmont Medicare office. Yes, it was closed, whereas previously it had been open on a Saturday morning. I had people lining up to sign the petition. It was further exacerbated by the fact that the Baird government had closed the motor registry office in the area. People could see and were saying to me that one thing you know is that a Liberal government takes away services. They were lining up to try and vote this government out. They are very upset that they are going to lose their Medicare office. They feel that the government is showing absolutely no respect for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the coming weeks, we will be getting more signatures on that petition. There will be many events where people can come along and show their displeasure at the fact that this government is trying to rip the Medicare office out of Belmont.
