        Briefly, and with the indulgence of the Speaker, I take the opportunity to thank the staff of the House of Representatives for being here until this late hour. I recognise that it is a late hour, being just on two oâ€™clock. But I also recognise that the changing of the standing orders is a strong matter of principle for us. We could not have anticipated that the debate would go on this long, but we do recognise the contribution of staff and I thank them for it.

        <p>
         On the issue that the Manager of Opposition Business raises, I put on the record that my office raised with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition some four hours ago, and I raised in a point of order in the House here, the fact that I requested the opposition that, if they would not give us the courtesy of letting us know when they would stop debating themselves on these issues, they at least inform the staff of the parliament. I think that that courtesy could have been granted, given that it was requested formally by me as Leader of the House. I certainly indicate on behalf of the government our appreciation of the contribution of the staff both inside and outside the chamber. I know that Hansard had particular difficulties with people who were not rostered on this evening. On behalf of the government, we did try to get some information to you, and it is unfortunate that that was not forthcoming.
