       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate a passionate, hardworking and innovative lady in my electorate of Bass, Mrs Jan Hughes. Jan has recently been announced as the Tasmanian Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Rural Women’s Award 2011 runner up.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few weeks ago I was privileged to meet Jan on a tour of the north-east of Tasmania, and to taste her award-winning ‘Rhu Bru’, one of the rhubarb products that she produces. The Tasmanian Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Rural Women’s Awards recognises and encourages rural women and their contribution to primary industries and research. Upon returning to the region from teaching in Tanzania, Jan and her husband, Olger, recognised that Scottsdale produced in excess of 500 tonnes of rhubarb each year, yet between 10 and 30 per cent was discarded as waste. Jan developed the refreshing non-alcoholic drink out of the blemished stalks which, may I say, is magnificent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan’s ambition is ‘to facilitate and forge a stronger partnership between agriculture and tourism and establish a viable agritourism business sector to provide economic growth for the Dorset region.’ I believe that Jan is well on her way to reaching her ambition.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate Jan on her success and also to wish her all the very best for the future. It is innovative and passionate people like Jan that keep regions like the north-east of Tasmania strong.
