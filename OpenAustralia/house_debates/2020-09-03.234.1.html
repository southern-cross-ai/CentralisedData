        On 15 August this year, we commemorated the 75th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_the_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         Victory in the Pacific
        </a>
        . On this day, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" rel="nofollow">
         Empire of Japan
        </a>
        accepted the allies' demand for an unconditional surrender. For Australians, it meant the end of the

         Second World War
        </a>
        . It was finally over. Almost one million brave Australians put their hand up to serve in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . This is a remarkable statistic when one reflects on the fact that our total population was just seven million at the time. Almost 27,000 gave their lives, including many of my fellow Tasmanians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania, including the north-west, the west coast and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        , has a rich history when it comes to the Second World War. Our very own battalion, the 2nd/40th, played a major role throughout the Second World War. My father, my grandfather and many of my ancestors served proudly in the 2nd/40th. In February 1942, whilst operating as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Sparrow Force
        </a>
        in Timor defending an airfield, this Tasmanian infantry battalion was attacked by a very much superior Japanese enemy force. Our Tasmanian battalion was forced to surrender by the Japanese, but not before losing 84 killed in action and 132 were badly wounded. My Great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Jack" rel="nofollow">
         Uncle Jack
        </a>
        , Jack Moles, was bayonetted through the leg during this tragic battle and would eventually spend three years of his life in various prisoner of war camps. This is where our Tasmanian service men were put to work on the famous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Railway" rel="nofollow">

        Jack would eventually come home, but the trauma of those prisoner of war camps would live with him for the remainder of his days.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other brave Australians served our nation in the far corners of the world, fighting in theatres of war from Europe to

        . The conflict also reached Australian shores. It was my privilege on the 75th anniversary to attend a commemorative wreath-laying service at Anzac Park in Ulverstone. It was a wet and cold day in Ulverstone, but that wasn't enough to deter 98-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Eaton" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Eaton
        </a>
        . He's a true gentleman in every sense of the word. He was in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAF
        </a>
        during the Second World War. He was employed as a radar operator and signaller. We share a lot in common, so we had a good yarn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later that afternoon I was honoured to visit 98-year-old veteran
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Walters" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Walters
        </a>
        at his home at Coroneagh Park to present him his medallion. Ron was born in Smithton in 1921. He served in the Army and was in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">

        and one in the Navy. His youngest son retired just a few months ago. It is, indeed, true that service truly runs in the blood.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the following

        I'd like to pass on my gratitude to Damien Griffin
