       <p>
        I am pleased to rise to speak about the activities planned in Bradfield to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac, which is a very important occasion for our nation as we work to perpetuate the memory of so many Australians who served our nation a century ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than $120,000 has been awarded by the federal government to support 11 local projects commemorating the Centenary of Anzac in my electorate of Bradfield. I am very pleased by the range, diversity and quality of the projects that have been chosen, which in turn reflects the range, diversity and quality of the projects which were proposed by many community organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The projects that will be funded include a series of publications from the Ku-ring-gai

       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the members of the working party that I established to help develop our approach for commemorating the Centenary of Anzac in Bradfield, particularly Chairman Major Rod White (Ret'd), and Mr Ken Broadhead,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel" rel="nofollow">
         Lieutenant Colonel
        </a>
        (Retâ€™d) who was our deputy chair and secretary. Their hard work, and the work of all on the working group, has been critical in reaching this point. I am confident that the range of activities which is planned will be an appropriate commemoration of this very important Centenary of Anzac, so that our local activities complement the national effort in this regard.
