       <p>
        In the last few weeks, Parramatta has lost two of its best—two people who lived full, rich lives with family, friends and community service. Roy Worrall and Margaret Russo lived in the hearts of their families and the hearts of the Labor movement, and we will miss them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Margaret Russo was born on 31 January 1938. She was a longstanding parishioner at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         St Patrick's Cathedral
        </a>
        in Parramatta where she was always actively involved in the local parish activities. Like her commitment to her church, Margaret was also committed to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . Whenever there was work to be done, Margaret was there. Year after year, state, federal or local, she rolled up her sleeves and did her part for the cause she believed in. She understood that Labor was a movement of people that cared about each other, and Margaret was an extraordinary example of the values. Whether it was just being at a polling station on election day or running a campaign, Margaret was an integral part of our local Labor movement, as was her family, with her husband, Phil, having served two terms as Labor Deputy Lord Mayor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Parramatta City Council
        </a>
        . This was a household that gave for the local Labor Party.
       </p>
       <p>
        Margaret was a much loved person. She was very welcoming. No-one who ever came in contact with Margaret ever had a bad word to say about her. She was an absolute delight to know and we will all miss her. She is survived by her husband, Phil, her children Stephen, Janine, Louise, Matthew, their partners and her nine grandchildren. I know she will be sorely missed by all who knew her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy Worrall, like Margaret, was also a dedicated party member and will be missed. He was born on 7 July 1931 in Portsmouth, England. Roy passed his secondary school exams, but he was unable to attend secondary school because of the outbreak of war and left school at the age of 14. He had been a naval cadet for two years at 11 and 12 years of age and had lost the sight of his left eye at the age of 11 when he was hit in the eye with a stone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy had a variety of interesting careers, perhaps reflecting the interesting man himself. First he was an oiler and greaser of axle boxes on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Railway" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Railway
        </a>
        , and in this role he earned less than he did when at school doing a paper run and odd jobs, perhaps igniting his passion for the Labor movement. He went on to become a builder's labourer, then a dogman, a crane driver, a pre-cast concrete erector and steel erector, a rigging supervisor, a first aid person and a security guard. Although often away from home for stretches at a time throughout his career, Roy always took pride in the fact that he sent more money home to his wife, Kit, than the man who lived next door. Roy was a character.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy married the love of his life, Kit, in 1952 at the age of 21. They went on together to have four children: Roy, Shirley, David and Jackie. They all migrated to Australia for a new future in 1965. Trying a variety of places for their new life, they lived at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulwich_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Dulwich Hill
        </a>
        , Bondi, Paddington and Marrickville, only to finally find home in Granville where they lived for the next 40 years. During this time he went on to become president of the retired Miscellaneous Workers Union of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and was granted life membership. He has been a proud union member all his life. He was also a president of the Granville Branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        and an active member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy was a very funny man. He once wrote a quite interesting story of his life, saying: 'I was born at an early age and would have been born in a hospital, but it was a home birth as I wanted to be near my mother.' He will be missed. I understand that his dad jokes—which I did not hear personally—were on the slightly difficult side, but, dad jokes and all, Roy will be absolutely missed. They both will be missed. Vale Margaret Russo and Roy Worrall.
