        Wynyard has lost a trailblazer and an entrepreneur with the passing of Francis Ransley

        . I've known Mr Ransley, an electrical engineer by trade, since I was a kid. In fact, everyone in that community has. I remember the day when, at the age of 13, I bought my first clock radio off him. It was made in Australiaâ€”how's that! Mr Ransley's passions were speedboat racing, vintage cars and his beloved community. His service in each of these pursuits was recognised when he was awarded the Order of Australia medal.
