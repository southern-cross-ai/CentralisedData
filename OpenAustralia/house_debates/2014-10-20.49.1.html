        As we approach another Australian summer I rise to recognise the important work of surf-lifesaving clubs throughout Australia and also in my electorate of Hindmarsh. As we know, the purpose of surf-lifesaving clubs is to save lives and create a safe environment for all who enjoy our great beaches. I was at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         West Beach
        </a>
        surf club with my children on the weekend. I commend the group leaders of the nippers and juniors programs who were out in their orange vests protecting the children as they learnt the challenges of the waves and the beaches. It was a happy day. It was great to see so many parents out there assisting. Well done to everyone.

        Surf Life Saving South Australia held their annual awards recently recognising the exceptional performance of athletes, volunteers and lifesavers over the last season. I congratulate all the recipients, especially those from the Hindmarsh electorate, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Hogan" rel="nofollow">

        of Henley Surf Life Saving Club, who won volunteer of the year. I would also like to congratulate and recognise the 16 volunteers who committed more than 150 hours of their summer last season to helping their respective communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Somerton Surf Life Saving Club in my electorate was also crowned South Australian Surf Club of the Yearâ€”a fantastic achievement. I attended their club opening recently, so I thank the club for their great hospitality. They were also the first club to reach 1,000 members in a season, so they have done some great things. As we know, the coalition government has also provided money to surf-lifesaving clubs around Australia in recognition of their great work.
