        It's fantastic to have this opportunity to congratulate St George
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Athletics" rel="nofollow">
         Little Athletics
        </a>
        on all the great work that they do. Founded in 1971, the organisation moved to Olds Park in 1979 where they still are today. It has been fantastic, over the years, to be able to work with the President, Theo Latanis; with Geoff Lindner, the very hard-working secretary; with Sam Latanis and all the other members of the committee who do so much so that local kids can get a great start in Little Athletics. More than 200 families are involved in St George Little Athletics. Every Friday night during the season you see those kids down at Olds Park enjoying the facilities, the camaraderie, the friendship and the fitness that comes from involvement in athletics.
       </p>

        I'm really pleased our government was able to support St George Little Athletics with a $500,000 grant to improve the facilities at Olds Park. Those facilities were, frankly, substandard. They needed to be upgraded. They hadn't been upgraded for a long time. I am really pleased that we were able to do that, with a new equipment for the field events in particular, for measurement, for improving the facilities around the amenities block and for a whole range of other activities. Congratulations to everyone in St George Little Athletics and thank you so much for everything you do in our community.

        I'd also like to acknowledge the Oatley Bay Scoutsâ€”

         Order! I apologise to the member for Banks, but, it being 10.30, we'll move on to the next motion. In accordance with the resolution agreed on 13 May 2021, the time for members' constituency statements has concluded.
