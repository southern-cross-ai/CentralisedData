        My question is to the Prime Minister. Before the last election, the Prime Minister promised real wage increases, but analysis of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        data shows that, in the first 12 months of his government, Australian workers have suffered a 5.1 per cent decline in real income—the worst in the developed world. Yet again, the Prime Minister has misled the people. Why are Australians paying the price for a distracted prime minister who is failing to focus on the real issues affecting Australians?

         I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question, notwithstanding the ironic nature of it, because the previous government—of which she was a minister for some of the time and some of the time not—had a deliberate policy of driving down wages. That was their deliberate policy. That was part of their economic architecture: a deliberate design. They might have forgotten a point in the election campaign when I was asked whether I would welcome a $1 increase in the minimum wage, and I said, 'Absolutely!' For days afterwards, those opposite railed about how this would destroy the economy and bring everything down. They thought that was the basis of an election campaign that was held—

           But it is not only once that that has happened, of course. There has been since then another case in which, once again, there was a significant increase in the minimum wage—something that is very important going forward. In terms of wages, as well, we on this side of the House are very proud that, in response to the aged-care royal commission, we have had a 15 per cent wage increase for aged-care workers. That applies to nurses—those people who look after our older Australians and give them the dignity and respect that they deserve. Did those opposite, when they received the royal commission, do that? No, they didn't do it. They didn't do it because they regarded it as just not a priority. We on this side of the House also have our closing loopholes bill—

              Resume your seat. The Prime Minister was asked about election commitments and real wages and about whether he has delivered on those commitments. I would just ask the Prime Minister to return to the question.

               I'm talking about wages. For workers on the minimum wage, an increase of nearly $3 an hour is what we have done. On 1 July, 2.4 million workers on awards got a 5.75 per cent pay rise—the largest increase since 2009. But there's legislation before the parliament to stop loopholes, to stop people working side by side who—
