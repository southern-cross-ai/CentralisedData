       <p>
        I would like to recognise the recent passing of Ms Kim Wilcher, who resided in my electorate of Maribyrnong. Kim’s story was brought to my attention by her husband, Mr Joe Palermo. They met during 1971, as young high school sweethearts in Keilor Heights. They were reunited 30 years later and, as Joe stated, ‘it was meant to be’. In 2002 they moved in together, and they were soon after joined by Joe’s children.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, their happiness was suddenly interrupted in June 2005. For some time, Kim had been troubled by abnormal stomach and back pain. Her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP

        told her to change her dietary intake, but this did not relieve the symptoms. After being rushed to hospital with shortness of breath, doctors discovered fluid on Kim’s lungs and she was soon diagnosed with late stages of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is known as the silent killer, claiming the lives of more than 800 Australian women each year. Early detection is difficult, as the symptoms are very vague—as they were in Kim’s case. A common misunderstanding is that a pap smear can detect ovarian cancer. However, it only screens for cervical cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joe’s experience with Kim set him on a new mission. Working with Ovarian Cancer Australia, Joe aims to increase awareness and raise funds to find a cure. Furthermore, Joe’s daughter Sarah recorded a song titled

        </i>
        inspired by Kim’s will to live. This CD is available from the Ovarian Cancer Australia website to help with funding and providing support for other women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kim’s story also highlights the need for compassion and understanding, a need that can sometimes be overlooked by institutions and departments. While Kim was fighting the silent killer, Joe was working and caring full time for Kim and the children. Trying to cope with the day-to-day grind can be difficult enough, let alone when it is compounded by the strain of a loved one’s terminal illness. Therefore, Kim applied for the disability support pension. Unfortunately, Kim’s claim was refused. Despite the fact that she was receiving intensive chemotherapy and confronting a terminal illness, she was assessed as not qualifying for the

        as it was considered she was able to work for 30 hours a week and would not be ill for a further two years. Kim’s strength was demonstrated by her writing to Centrelink, voicing her disappointment and acknowledging the fact that she might not survive for two years. However, the stress proved too great a burden and Kim did not submit an appeal.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Kim’s passing Joe approached my office for assistance. One of my staff members, Annette Hibberd, persisted in a very professional manner in pursuing Joe’s case with Centrelink. I am pleased that Centrelink reconsidered the case and Joe received $19,000 in back payment, which has helped alleviate both the financial and emotional pressures for Joe and his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kim battled a courageous fight against ovarian cancer, continuing with family life whilst facing financial difficulty. In Kim’s memory, I want to commend Joe for his determination and efforts to prevent, as he said, ‘the silent killer which stole my twin-flame soul mate from me’.
