        My question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General update the House on what the government is doing to assist persons with disabilities, including on the international stage?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Dobell for his question on this very important matter. Today the Rudd government will take an important step for the rights of persons with disabilities. Today I will table a national interest analysis proposing that Australia ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         This convention aims to remove barriers faced by people with disabilities. It enhances opportunities to participate in social and political decision making. It also recognises their rights to education, health, work, decent living conditions, freedom of movement and equal recognition before the law. We are grateful for the valuable input received during the extensive consultations that have occurred in the preparation of this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         The lead we are taking on the international stage is complemented by practical steps we are taking to improve the rights of persons with disabilities at home. The Prime Minister recently announced an additional $100 million in capital funding to build supported accommodation for people with disabilities. Earlier this week the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs outlined a new agreement to provide a $1.9 billion boost in funding. She rightly congratulated the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Childrenâ€™s Services for his role in this important area.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Rudd government is committed to a whole-of-government national disability strategy to increase participation, social inclusion and support for people with disabilities and, importantly, for their carers. The Minister for Employment Participation and others are also developing a specific national mental health and disability employment strategy to identify barriers to employment for people with a disability and practical steps to increase their participation in the workforce and hence their independence. In my portfolio we are developing standards for access to premises and finalising a review of transport standards. I would like to acknowledge the work and assistance of my colleagues the minister for transport and the minister for industry in respect of those matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, the government has a long-term plan and is committed to being a regional and international leader for people with disabilities and, importantly, for their families. I commend the national interest analysis to the House and I urge all members to support the timely ratification of this very important convention.
