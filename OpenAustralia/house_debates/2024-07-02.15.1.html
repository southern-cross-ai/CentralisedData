       <p>
        The Growing Regions Program has been a disappointment for Mayo. When first announced, we were disappointed that large swathes of the electorate were no longer eligible. Raising the rural and regional classification of the electorate with the minister fell on deaf ears. Our disappointment was compounded when we learnt that not only was much of the electorate ineligible but only 40 out of 311 suitable applications were successful, with only one very deserving application in Mayo. The total value of the 311 suitable applications exceeded $1.4 billion, of which the 40 successful applications comprised just $206 million, leaving an underspend of $93 million. Considerable effort, time and money is invested by councils and community groups when preparing applications for government grants. I appreciate it's not possible for every application to be successful. But I do feel for the unsuccessful applicants, who must now reconcile that their applications were unsuccessful despite being deemed suitable by the department and despite money actually being in the bank for it. I congratulate the Penneshaw Foreshore Upgrade Project as the only successful application in Mayo, and I do hope that round 2 efforts afford better outcomes for Mayo. I must say I'm pleased the minister has said that she will roll over those $93 million, but that's $93 million that could be now spent in regional Australia.
