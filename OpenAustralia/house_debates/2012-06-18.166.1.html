        Hudson Park Primary School is located in Girrawheen, a suburb in Cowan. For most of its existence it was known as Girrawheen Primary School, but it was in recent times renamed Hudson Park. The children of Hudson Park Primary School are challenged by the lower socioeconomic circumstances of the suburb of Girrawheen. However, it is fortunate that the staff at the school are totally committed to the children and believe that each one of them has a great future. As is usual with schools in these situations, despite the challenges that the schools face you will often find long-serving teachers that have devoted themselves to providing opportunities for the children. Dedicated teaching together with understanding and patience provides positive learning environments. It is about one such teacher I would like to speak.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the start of July 2010 the school underwent a dramatic change. It was the retirement of long-serving principal Doug Grasso, who had spent 16½ years at the school as principal. His retirement was at the end of 41 years as an educator. When asked about his retirement, Doug Grasso said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “I love being able to watch kids grow and develop as individuals … I found with teaching, the more I did it, the more I liked it.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I wish to speak of former principal Doug Grasso. Unfortunately, Doug passed away yesterday after a fairly short illness—a tragic illness. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his profound influence on the lives of thousands of students that passed through the school during his leadership. I asked for comments from those who knew him well, or knew him better than I did. It is heartening to appreciate how well he was regarded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terri Reid, the principal of the Karrinyup Primary School and a former colleague, said of Doug that he was a true gentleman, always solutions focused, an absolute pleasure to work with and an inspiring role model as a great principal and a great human being. Janet Straker, a teacher for 10 years at the school, said of Doug that he was always kind, fair and compassionate with children, staff and parents. He never showed anger or frustration with even the most challenging of students. He was extremely supportive of staff professionally and personally. He also had a wicked sense of humour. Former registrar Barbara Blake said that Doug always worked hard to get all the difficult students to be the best they could be. Barbara informed me that Doug gained the respect of all students, including those who had been suspended from other schools or who had difficulties, because he demonstrated that he cared for them and believed in them. The result was children that were better behaved, learning more and liking their school experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is little wonder that a couple of years ago, when Doug left Hudson Park and full-time leadership as a principal, the children made and donned hats that reflected Doug's diminished hairline. That was reported in the local newspaper. The guy was simply a legend in Girrawheen—a great role model and a brilliant educator—and his educational legacy will live on for a generation to come. The community most certainly salutes his influence.
