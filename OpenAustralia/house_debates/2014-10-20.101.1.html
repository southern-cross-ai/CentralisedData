         <p>
          I can advise the House that the President and I made a decision on advice that was given to us that there was an action planned that would have disrupted the business of the House. We would have been derelict in our duty if we had not dealt with it. We made an interim ruling. We said that the question of face coverings was relevant because of the need to identify people who disrupt from the galleries, and there was no private space available to the entry to these galleries for face identification. So the interim ruling was made. Today we have issued a further ruling which now says that people entering with face coverings will be facially identified at the point of entry of the building, where there is a private space where people can be facially identified before coming in, and therefore the other ruling is not necessary, because they can simply then come through into the chamber.

           I have a further question under standing order 103, Madam Speaker. The President of the other place also referred to receiving advice about a threat of disruption to the parliament. Madam Speaker, can you inform the House as to whether or not the advice of that threat of disruption came from the office of the Prime Minister or a different source?

             Madam Speaker, under standing under 103, there is not a limit. Previously there has been disruptive conduct in the public galleries from groups such as anti-climate-change groups and farming groups and protesters who you yourself had joined on the front lawns of parliament. Could the Speaker please consult with the clerks and relevant departments and advise the House why segregation was never required for these groups?

             </small>
             <p>
              I can give you the answer with regard to the need for facial recognition: for the simple reason that, when somebody is disruptive in the House, that person may be banned from the parliament for a period of 24 or more hours, and, to know if that person is attempting to re-enter the parliament, there is a need for facial recognition. None of the other groups, to my knowledge, had a problem with facial recognition.

              Opposition members: But they could disrupt the parliament!
             </p>
             <p>
              The question is recognition, and also there are a number of people who are banned from this parliament who need to be recognised, as security issues.

               I respect that, Madam Speaker. As you know, my question related to segregation. On the evening of 2 October, the day of the announcement of the new policy for the public galleries, it was reported that the Prime Minister had asked you to reconsider the policy. However, the next day a journalist reported that your spokesman had said no request had been received from the Prime Minister to change this policy. Did you, Madam Speaker, receive a request from the Prime Minister to reconsider the policy?
