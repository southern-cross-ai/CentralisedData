       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. A support service for people who are homeless in my electorate of Dawson is at breaking point. Operator of Orange Sky Laundry in my electorate, Lisa Jamison, has said: 'You go to the grocery store and the price difference from six months ago is astronomical. We've seen rental increases from $260 per week to $350.' Prime Minister, why are Australian families paying the price for Labor's economic incompetence?

         I thank the member for Dawson for his question that goes to cost-of-living measures and the impact it has on people in his community. What we know is that every single person working in that community and paying tax will get a bigger tax cut on Monday as a result of the measures that we've put in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Dawson also knows that those opposite, on his team, said that it would crush confidence, it would obliterate opportunity, it would undermine the strength of the economy and it was Marxist economics to give everyone a tax cut. We are getting wages moving again, but you voted against every single measure we put in place to ensure wages got moving. The coalition claimed that it would return Australia to the

         , it would close down the economy and it would leave supermarket shelves bare.
        </p>
        <p>
         On cheaper medicines, you voted six times in the Senate to stop it, to stop cheaper medicines. Not surprising, given, as health minister, the opposition leader wanted to jack up the price of essential medicines by $5 a script. When we strengthened Medicare by tripling bulk-billing incentives, the shadow health minister dismissed the initiative and opposed it. There was opposition to cheaper child care as well.

         And now our energy price relief plan—

           has been described by the former leader of his party, the National Party—the member who rose not once, but twice to the position—the sequel no-one wanted to see—the member for New England, as 'Venezuelan communism'. That's how he described cheaper energy bills.

           Now, when it comes to housing, there was a vote over there in the Senate this morning. Once again, we've seen the 'no-alition' of the coalition and the Greens get together once again.

            I know where the Manager of Opposition Business is going with this. I'm glad the Prime Minister clarified what his definition of that was. It's being used in a different way, so we'll just get the Prime Minister to return back to the question.

             I was asked about housing, and, over there in the Senate today, they have voted to split off the build-to-rent proposals from our tax legislation that would encourage more investment in development. The reason why the Greens say they oppose it is that developers will build the new housing, and they voted for that proposition. They voted for it. Who do you think builds houses?
