        Each year around the world International Women’s Day is celebrated on March 8. This is a day when women throughout the world come together to celebrate life as women and the progress made to advance equality for women and to assess the challenges that remain. It is a day when women are recognised for their achievements, without regard for divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political. This special day also provides an opportunity to consider steps to bring about equality for women in all their diversity.

        International Women’s Day was first celebrated in Australia in 1928.

        in Darwin. The exhibition is part of International Women’s Day celebrations. However this exhibition is even more significant as it is a pictorial tribute to 20 women with disabilities. I note that we have in the House tonight the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, and he is also the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction. The exhibition participants are all women of amazing courage, energy and with a commitment to achieving the most out of their lives. They cover many activities, from world champion swimmer Tahnee Afuhaamango, horse rider and jillaroo Quita Docking to library assistant Christina Fowler.

        In Darwin and Palmerston we have one of the youngest populations in the land. The most distinctive feature of our vibrant community is the diversity—a great mix of cultures, religions and Indigenous people.

        From birth, it must be drilled into the conscious and the subconscious of all men that there are no circumstances—no circumstances—in which violence against women is acceptable.
