        <p>
         I'd like to thank the member for Robertson for his question. He knows, as the government does, that many people are feeling the pinch with cost of living right now, which is why the Albanese government is taking action to provide people with support.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my portfolio of social services, we have strengthened the social safety net. Just last week around five million people received a boost to their social security payments through indexation. For those on payments like JobSeeker and for recipients of Commonwealth Rent Assistance, this builds on the rate increases that the government delivered in the last budget, meaning more money in the pockets of those doing it the toughest. And we've strengthened the social safety net by expanding the eligibility for single parenting payment, benefiting over 77,000 single parents, mainly women.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've frozen the social security deeming rates, and we've expanded access to the Commonwealth health seniors card. We've taken action by helping concession cardholders with their power bills. We've made medicines cheaper and we've made it cheaper for pensioners, children and other concession card holders to see a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is also providing more support for new parents through our historic investment in paid parental leave by expanding the scheme to a full six months by 2026. Families will receive an extra six weeks of paid leave following the birth or adoption of their child. When fully rolled out, that's over $5,000 more in the family budget. And it's not only our government ensuring that parents earn more while they take time off to look after their baby, but we're also ensuring women will retire with more, with our recent announcement that we will pay superannuation on the government paid parental leave scheme from July 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, we're also providing more support for community sector organisations, helping those organisations pay fairer wages to their workers. This includes fairer wages for people like Amelia, who works for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pat's" rel="nofollow">
          St Pat's
         </a>
         as a support worker, helping those experiencing homelessness. Like all community sector workers, Amelia will not only benefit from a pay increase, she will also benefit from Labor's tax cuts. Amelia will receive $1,330 in tax cuts in July this year to assist with the household budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government is supporting Australians in a range of circumstances through the social services portfolio. Whether it's those who rely on the safety net, work in the community sector or are taking time out to be a parent, it is this government that is ensuring people earn more and keep more of what they earn.
