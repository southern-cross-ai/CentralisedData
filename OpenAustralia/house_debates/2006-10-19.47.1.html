        My question is addressed to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . I ask the minister: in view of very concerning reports about the psychological and emotional impact of the current drought on farmers and their families, would the minister advise the House of the governmentâ€™s approach to mental health initiatives in rural areas and, in particular, where farmers can turn for professional help?

        <p>
         This is an important and heartfelt question from the member for Gwydir. I have to say that I think that city people often find it hard to understand the mental suffering faced by farming families watching generations of hard work destroyed by drought.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian farmers, as the member well knows, are a tough and resilient people but many of them are now under extreme pressure. Government cannot solve all the vagaries of climate and market. We cannot massage away all the griefs of the human condition but we can and must provide good services to people in need. In addition to the Regional Health Services, which the Commonwealth government funds in some 120 towns with fewer than 5,000 people, the government has recently announced a further $51 million to provide psychological services in smaller communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have just funded 17 new suicide prevention services in rural areas and we have just given another $18 million to Lifeline. Importantly, in June, beyondblue launched a new phone counselling service for rural men and this has already helped hundreds of men in areas affected by drought.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stoicism is an admirable trait, but not if it makes problems worse. Talking about problems will not make them go away but can certainly make them easier to cope with. Like the member for Gwydir, I certainly hope that farmers in country areas will not think that silence is strength, and they will not bottle up their problems until they are beyond help.
