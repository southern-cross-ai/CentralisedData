       <p>
        Today I would like to praise the students from a high school in my electorate who I believe are a great example of Australian multiculturalism at its finest. I recently attended a flag ceremony at Airds High School and was not only impressed by the calibre of the performances but the attitudes of its students, teachers and parents. The flag ceremony is held each year to recognise the diverse cultural backgrounds of the students and staff at the school. It has become a major community event, with the school encouraging involvement by students and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also recognises the school's unique history. Opening in 1974, Airds High School was the second government high school to be opened in Campbelltown. The student population at that time was predominantly Anglo-Saxon, but by 1986 the school population had changed with a sufficient increase in students with a language background other than English. In 1986 the school developed strategies to pre-empt racial tension and ensure an inclusive environment for all students no matter where they came from. One of these strategies was the annual flag ceremony, the first of its kind in my community. Over the years several schools across the region have also adopted and implemented these ceremonies as part of their school calendar year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, it was great to see Briar Road, John Warby, Bradbury and Woodland Road public schools join in the celebrations. The flag ceremony involves the flags of various nations presented by representatives of these countries. The flags then form a permanent display at the school as a visual reminder of its multicultural nature. The flag ceremony also involves multicultural entertainment including dancing, singing and musical performances to enhance the cultural feel of the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were some fantastic performances by the students. I was particularly impressed by the traditional dances performed by the students in their country's traditional costume and some very talented vocal performances throughout the morning. While watching the students perform I could see how proud they were of their culture, and it was great to see so many members of the Airds community in attendance to support these students. It was obvious to me that Airds High School takes pride in its multiculturalism and recognises the value of living in a multicultural community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from the flag ceremony, the school encourages many multicultural activities throughout the year involving students, parents and community groups. These initiatives are obviously working; as I watched the flag ceremony and cultural performances last week I could not help but become overwhelmed with pride for these students, their teachers and their parents. The traditional performances show that these students hold great pride in their own heritage. There were many proud parents and family members watching in the audience. Students, teachers and parents from many different cultural backgrounds were cheering each other on. They offered a level of support to each other which I have not experienced before during my time as the member for Macarthur. Not only was the flag ceremony one of the most entertaining school assemblies I have ever been to, it also reminded me of how blessed I am to live in a multicultural country and a multicultural community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate Principal Max Foord and all of the students, teachers and community members involved in the Airds High School flag ceremony. They should all be very proud of what they have achieved. They are a fine example of what Sydney's Macarthur region is all about.
