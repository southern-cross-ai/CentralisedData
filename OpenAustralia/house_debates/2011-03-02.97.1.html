        I have spoken before in this House about the wonderful community contribution of so many people in Montrose in the electorate of Casey, particularly those involved in the redevelopment of the Montrose Recreational Reserve. I have spoken of how, with local, state and federal funding, the community was able to partner with so many businesses and individuals to redevelop that recreation reserve with sporting facilities and a state-of-the-art children’s playground. Without the incredible work and contribution of so many local volunteers and so many local businesses that donated their time, it would not have been possible for this reserve to be redeveloped in the way it was. When the reserve was opened back in 2009, some 450 volunteers led by coordinator

        from Montrose had worked 1,200 shifts over five days to assemble the playground. You can imagine, and I know all members of parliament will agree with me, the shock and disappointment last weekend when it was discovered that part of the playground had been torched on Friday evening by vandals. This obviously is an incredible disappointment not only to all of those who worked so hard on the project but also to the many local Montrose kids and those in the surrounding area who enjoy this state-of-the-art project.

        Unfortunately, 400 volunteers worked many community hours to create the project and in just a few senseless minutes irresponsible people—the police do not know whether they are from the area or from outside the area—torched part of the playground. I agree absolutely with the local police, who called on those responsible to come forward. The spirit of the Montrose community is so strong that they will of course recover from this and rebuild, but I ask those who have committed this senseless, pointless act to think of the effect they have had on the children who helped to create the playground, to reflect on the fact that the damage they have done is pointless and to come forward, as the police have asked.
