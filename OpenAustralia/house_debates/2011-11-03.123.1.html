       <p>
        Small business is doing it tough in many areas right around Australia and the south-west is suffering its fair share. A number of small business people have come to me recently looking for help. Manufacturing and retail businesses in particular have been facing financial hardship. Many have had to close as customers hold onto their money, either increasing their savings or paying down debt or simply because there is probably a lack of confidence in the way the government is managing this economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also had significant increases in people having trouble making their payments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        . We know that everyone should ensure they meet their tax liabilities and obligations, but it concerns me that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        appears extremely punitive. A number of business owners have sought payment schedules to meet the entire tax liability that their businesses could afford, agreeing to pay at times over $100,000 or more. The ATO, however, seems determined that these schedules will have a 12-month time limit. When you are a small business in a regional area that is a major issue. This has in some cases attracted massive fines and compounding penalties. Some of these companies that could have traded out of trouble over a two-year period will be potentially bankrupted in just one.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wonder whether the government is so desperate for revenue in 2012 to meet its promise—or a target or vague aim or whatever it is—to achieve a budget surplus in 2012-13 that it would prefer to get what it can in that year even if it means bankrupting these good businesses. These demands are causing great stress to business owners and their families who are trying desperately to trade their way out of financial trouble. They have kept workers on; they have tried everything they can to maintain a business in difficult times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had great assistance in managing the stress for these people from local community support networks. These include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        Centre Bunbury-Wellington where Alison Maughan and her staff are available to help whenever they can with financial and business advice. The team provides an excellent and vital service. The effects of business stress are not only financial, however, and this is where the pressure comes. They frequently have a major impact on the mental health of business owners and their families. Even though they are under massive financial pressure, it is the emotional pressure that really brings them down, with incredible stress sometimes driving people to consider desperate acts. I have dealt with people in these circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this instance we have had to seek more help for them. Community support networks are vital. The Regional Men's Health Initiative has been invaluable in managing both the financial and the emotional issues faced by some of my constituents, particularly a number of men. Julian Krieg, Owen Catto, Andrew Grist and Graeme Chopping have provided a fantastic level of support for many of my constituents. I put on record in this place my thanks to them for assisting people when they are extremely desperate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community is also well served by the South West Women's Health and Information Centre in Bunbury. For the partners, those who do the books, those who have to deal with their husband, their partner or their family, the stress compounds on women in this situation as well. People are loath to ask for help often when they need it most. They are so desperate, they are so crowded by all the pressures they have, they simply cannot deal with them—they are overwhelmed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank those in Bunbury giving the vital services that help to look after the mental and physical wellbeing of women and men in the south-west. They are vital cogs in my community in the south-west. I take this opportunity to commend and thank all of these groups and individuals and the many others who are assisting small business owners—be they retailers, manufacturers, processors or agricultural producers—to get through these difficult times. Without them our jobs as members would be much harder. I also really want to encourage anyone in my electorate who is finding themselves in this situation with the tax office or facing incredible stress to get in touch with me. We will give you every assistance we can to help you to manage your problems. We will direct you to the advice and support that you might need. Do not get to the point that those who have walked into my office in the last 12 to 18 months have got to; do not be that desperate. Come and ask for the help that you need. I would encourage you. This is a support network that I would particularly ask the men to take advantage of.
