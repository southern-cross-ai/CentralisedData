        It is with great sadness that I rise to remember someone who many in this place from all sides of the parliament will also remember with great fondness. I rise to pay tribute to the life of Jan Mossfield, who passed away on 8 September 2015, aged 80 years, with her beloved husband, Frank, by her side.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many in this place would know, Frank was the member for Greenway from 1996 until 2004. Both he and Jan were good friends of mine. Frank and Jan were very much a team. After the devastating election loss in 1996, they focused on building up camaraderie, I believe, within the Labor caucus. Jan was well known for hosting afternoon teas in Frank's office, laying on things like pumpkin scones, and playing a very important role in Frank's adjustment as the new member for Greenway in opposition.
       </p>

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        That is right: Frank and Jan had eight children. They were a very well-respected family within the Blacktown area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two of my staff worked for Frank while he was the member for Greenway. I vividly recall that Jan was as solid as a rock. She would accompany him to just about every function. I remember Frank would often begin constituency statements like this one by saying, 'On the weekend, my wife Jan and I'. They either attended something, they would open something or they would be out working in the community together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parkinson's is a terrible disease. I visited Jan a little while ago with Frank and two of my staff. She was very frail. They had been through a few nursing homes and assisted care facilities. He loved that woman so much. He took such beautiful care of her and he nursed her with dignity right until her death. Father Confeggi at St Patrick's sent me a message that she died at his side peacefully and he woke up to find that she was gone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan Mossfield was a thoroughly decent human being. She was a wonderful mother and grandmother. She was a woman of faith and she was a woman who supported her husband in everything that he did. To Frank and his whole family: my thoughts and prayers are with you at this time. Rest in peace, Jan.
