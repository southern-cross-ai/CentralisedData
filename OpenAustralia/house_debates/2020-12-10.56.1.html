       <p>
        I'm just trying to keep a straight face here. As we come to the end of a long and difficult year I'd like to extend my gratitude to the community of Wentworth for keeping New South Wales COVID safe. For all those in my community who have practiced social distancing, have worn masks, have undergone testing and have checked in on their neighbours I want to extend my thanks. It's the efforts of individuals like you, little by little and day by day, that've helped to ensure our success.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to make a special shout-out to the schools in my electorate. This has been a particularly tough year for students from kindergarten right through to years 11 and 12. Teachers and schools have done a great job in getting through this. Students deserve a remarkable vote of thanks and respect for having got through one of the most difficult years in the academic history of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier today I was honoured to help light one of the candles for Hanukkah to celebrate the start of Hanukkah, which kicks off tonight. Hanukkah is a particularly important festival for the Jewish community in Australia. It celebrates the triumph of light over dark, of hope over despair and of good over evil. I wish everyone in the Jewish community Hanukkah sameach!
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in very happy news, I'm delighted to tell the children across Wentworth that I've just head from
