       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Support_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Higher Education Support Act
        </a>
        2003 to provide funding to support the implementation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Quality_Framework" rel="nofollow">
         Research Quality Framework
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RQF" rel="nofollow">
         RQF
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also make important changes to our higher education sector by implementing a revised set of National Protocols for Higher Education Approval Processes
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        The revised protocols will provide greater diversity within our higher education sector by allowing new types of institutions to operate in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also make other amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003
        <i>
         .
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill highlights this government’s commitment to achieving both excellence and relevance in research. The Research Quality Framework will ensure taxpayers’ money is being invested in research of the highest quality which delivers real benefits to the higher education sector, to business and the wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognising there will be implementation costs, this bill provides around $41 million for two programs to assist universities and other higher education providers with the implementation of the Research Quality Framework. The Australian Scheme for Higher Education Repositories program will support the establishment of digital repositories throughout the higher education sector. The Implementation Assistance Program will provide support to assist institutions with new administrative and information systems for the Research Quality Framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to reflect changes to the National Protocols for Higher Education Processes
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        The national protocols were first agreed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ministerial Council
        </a>
        on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in 2000, and regulate the recognition of new universities, the operation of overseas universities in Australia and the accreditation of courses offered by higher education institutions. In other words, the national protocols are the ‘gateway’ to our higher education system.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July 2006, Ministers approved a set of revised national protocols to take effect from 31 December 2007, which will require legislative change in all jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revisions to the national protocols are the outcome of extensive consultations involving state, territory and Commonwealth governments and the higher education sector. The revisions make possible the emergence of specialist universities, concentrating teaching and research efforts in only one or two broad fields of study.
       </p>
       <p>
        The revised protocols provide pathways for more institutions to become self-accrediting, where they have a strong track record in higher education delivery and quality assurance. They also allow new universities to develop from provisional ‘university colleges’ under the sponsorship of an established university.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another significant change is the extension of the national protocols to apply to all new and existing higher education institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these changes align well with this government’s vision for a more diverse Australian higher education sector. A diverse and high-quality higher education sector has the flexibility to respond to volatile international markets. Greater diversity will promote choice for students, staff and employers, and encourage competition and excellence amongst institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In separate measures, the bill allows for the first time cross-institutional arrangements to be extended to Commonwealth supported students at non-table A higher education providers. Previously, Commonwealth supported students were only able to undertake study in Commonwealth supported places in a cross-institutional arrangement between table A providers.  This amendment provides greater flexibility for providers and extends the range of study options available to Commonwealth supported students.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill sets a six-week time limit for a student to correct information affecting their eligibility for Commonwealth assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill contains a number of technical amendments that will clarify existing Higher Education Loan Program and Commonwealth supported student arrangements and ensure the legislation reflects original policy intent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill clarifies the overseas study requirements in relation to eligibility for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS" rel="nofollow">
         OS
        </a>
        -
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
         HELP
        </a>
        assistance by enabling a student to apply for OS-HELP assistance if they are already overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill ensures that higher education providers may determine the campuses at which units of study will be offered to Commonwealth supported students. This amendment will allow providers to stipulate that a student may be Commonwealth supported for their units of study, only if the student undertakes those units at a particular campus of the provider.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill requires that Commonwealth supported students must reside in Australia while undertaking their studies (although provision is made to ensure entitlement to Commonwealth support and assistance where a student is required to be overseas for part of their course of study).
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will ensure that permanent residents will not be entitled to Commonwealth support or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS
        </a>
        -HELP or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEE" rel="nofollow">
         FEE
        </a>
        -HELP assistance if they are undertaking their entire course of study overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to these measures the bill contains some minor technical amendments which will improve the overall operation of the Higher Education Support Act 2003
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        One such measure is to ensure that the suspension of approval as a higher education provider under the Act will be a legislative instrument and therefore made publicly available on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Register
        </a>
        of Legislative Instruments.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill builds on the $8.2 billion investment this government is making in higher education this year, a 26 per cent real increase on 1995. Australia does compare well internationally in education. Around 31 per cent of Australians aged 25 to 64 have a tertiary qualification compared to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        country mean of 25 per cent. Thirty-five per cent of Australian 19-year-olds are engaged in tertiary education which is seven per cent higher than the OECD average. To suggest that the Australian government’s investment in tertiary education declined between 1995 and 2003 is simply wrong. That is only taking half the picture—and leaving out much of our training expenditure and taxpayer subsidies to higher education students. Including such public subsidies, Commonwealth funding for postschool education has increased by 35 per cent in real terms since 1995-96.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill before the House is a clear expression of the Australian government’s strong commitment to higher education and will enhance the quality and diversity of our higher education system and the choices available to our students. It reflects the government’s commitment to ensuring that Australia’s research and higher education sectors continue to play a vital role in our ongoing economic prosperity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
