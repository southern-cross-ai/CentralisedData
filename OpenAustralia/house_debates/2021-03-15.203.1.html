        Last week I visited Gibbs Street Primary School, in

        in my electorate, as they were the recipient of a grant through the Morrison government's Local Schools Community Fund which provided $30.2 million in 2019-20. The fund is an application based process open to all eligible schoolsâ€”government, Catholic and independent. It is designed to benefit students in their small community by contributing to small-scale projects and their associated costs at the local school level. Funds are paid by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, who pay the funds to the approved authority of a school.

        made payments for approved projects in January 2020 and February 2020, and all successful schools should have already received their funds.

        The Gibbs Street Primary School applied for funding to purchase and install EduTouch interactive

        panels in classrooms. This technology offers different ways of reaching and teaching students. It allows the teacher to interact with students better, to use a multimodal form of teaching, and to provide more entertaining ways to teach and a better way to learn and get the lessons, facts and objectives across to the students. They enable the school to have the latest technology for the teacher to deliver the curriculum through digital technology. The school principal, teachers and students praised the Morrison government's grant of $19,950 and look forward to the fantastic educational outcomes that will be delivered through this technology.
