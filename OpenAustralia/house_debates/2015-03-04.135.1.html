        There is a missing link of approximately five kilometres in the north metropolitan coastal pathway network between the suburbs of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Burns Beach
        </a>
        and Mindarie, which, when eventually constructed, will link the entire coastline of Moore with the neighbouring electorates of Stirling and Curtin to the south. The resulting dual use coastal pathway will provide a transport link of some 40 kilometres, improving recreational and sporting amenity for both pedestrians and cyclists, with stunning views of the Perth coastline. I have been campaigning for this connection since 2007. As a local government councillor at the

        , I presented a petition with 650 signatures in support of connecting Burns Beach with Mindarie Marina.

        Similarly, at the southern end, the

        </a>
        received a petition of more than 2,500 signatories supporting the initiative. In the years since, there has been increasing demand for the shared path as a result of population growth in the area. I acknowledge the contribution of the cities of Wanneroo and Joondalup, as well as the local state member for

        , in actively being involved in the planning processes over many years. However, planning red tape and bureaucratic process continue to present obstacles against community expectations by drawing out the time frame for delivery of projects of obvious merit such as this. There are a number of complex technical issues which still require all levels of government—local, state and federal—to resolve them cooperatively.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, the proposed route crosses a number of jurisdictional boundaries, raising the question of amalgamating the parks and recreation parcels of land for creation of a regional park and determining responsibility for the ongoing management of the area. Secondly, in relation to the alignment of the path, there exists a strong consensus within the community that the preferred route should be as close to the coast as possible. The preference for proximity to the coast must be balanced against the environmental value of the dunes, the dynamic nature of the coastline and the steeply undulating topography.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction of the pathway near the coastal area is likely to involve significant costs. Thirdly, from a federal perspective, confirmation of the presence of the graceful sun moth requires any development proposals to comply with the requirements of the

        1999. To advance this project, all levels of government—local, state and federal—have a role to play in working cooperatively together to deliver this landmark recreational project for the community.
