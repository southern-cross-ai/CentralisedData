        It always gives me great pleasure to rise in this House and speak about some of the wonderful achievements of the people of the electorate of Forde. Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate

       </p>
       <p>
        I also recently had the opportunity to attend the official opening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" rel="nofollow">
         YMCA
        </a>
        Trade Skills Centre at Kingston. It is prescient that my good friend the member for Rankin is here, because that is actually in his electorate and he was instrumental in part of that as well. So it is good to see Jim here. I would like to recognise all the students for taking part in the valuable vocational training, which is available thanks to the involvement of generous stakeholders. It was a great morning meeting with young people who are learning a range of skills and gaining the confidence they need to pursue future employment and study opportunities. The centre is making a real difference to the lives of our young people, providing a place for them to learn, grow and feel a sense of belonging.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate young Lachlan Eyers, who won the 2015 Quota Beenleigh World Service Ambassador of the Year award. Lachlan was one of nine local students to present a speech about various global projects being carried out by Quota clubs around the world. The money that Lachlan won will be donated to the Quota club that runs the project that he was speaking about. Well done also to Naomi Smith, who was the runner-up, and Akshaya Ajit, who came third.

        Unfortunately, sometimes there are events in our communities which are very sad to comprehend and which affect a wide range of people. This was the case for the Waterford demons rugby league club, who have rallied behind 15-year-old player
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Hall
        </a>
        , who was unfortunately the victim of a recent hit-and-run accident. The Logan business community and club sponsors mustered support to donate a mobility scooter, wheelchair, bath transfer board, pushbike and other items to make Andrew's life more comfortable while he continues to have operations for his serious leg injuries. This is a testament to the spirit and generosity of the local business and sporting communities. I would like to wish Andrew Hall all the best during his recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I had the pleasure of hosting a number of mobile office visits and community forums around the electorate to catch up with local residents and constituents and hear their views on the federal budget and other local matters. I would like to thank everyone who came along to the community forums at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Coomera" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Shailer Park to share their thoughts. It was a worthwhile process, and I am very pleased to pass on the positive reactions to this year's budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        A warm welcome also to Queensland's newest senator, Joanna Lindgren, who was appointed to the Senate by the Queensland parliament last Thursday, following the retirement of Senator Brett Mason. I very much look forward to working with Joanna, and I wish her all the best in her new role. As Joanna is a local Logan lady, it was great to see another person from our community represented in the other house.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to pass on my condolences to Jaryd Campbell and Belinda Warwick, who farewelled their son Roman Campbell-Warwick on the weekend. Two-year-old Roman sadly passed away in a house fire at Beenleigh on 14 May. One of the things to come of this tragedy was the outpouring of support from the Beenleigh and surrounding Logan communities. At times of tragedy we often see the best in our communities, and the care and compassion shown by so many who have helped this family has been tremendous.
