        Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was seeking the call in the consideration in detail stage of the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006.

           I am sorry, member for Hunter. I did not see you seek the call, and the question has been put and the bill has been passed. We have moved on to the next item of business and the Clerk has called on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006. The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

            I am very happy to take this opportunity to make a contribution on the

             Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006
            </a>
            . What an important piece of legislation it is. It is so important that the government wanted to deny me an opportunity to make a contribution on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 in the consideration in detail stage. What I wanted to say on that bill was how disappointed I was that the Treasurer did not turn up to summarise debate on that bill. Members of the House will recall the Treasurer coming in here to introduce the bill with great fanfare. He was all done up in his regal best.

             Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable memberâ€™s remarks have nothing to do with the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006, as he well knows. He does not know what is in the bill. He is only speaking because his friend the member for Corio has not turned up to speak.

               Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not all that relevant. The point is that the member for Corio understood that I would be making a contribution on the previous bill. Somehow or other, I was denied the opportunity to make that contribution. The member for Corio understood I would be and on that basis was not here for the commencement of this debate.

                         I am certainly happy to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course, members of the House on both sides will understand that this bill has monetary implications, budgetary implications. This initiative will need to be funded substantially, and this is my very concern. I am concerned about the future of this governmentâ€™s revenues. I am concerned about the forecasting capability of this government. The Treasurer was happy to come in here and deliver a budget and happy to come in here and deliver the tax cut bill, but he was not happy to come back in here and sum up on those tax bills, notwithstanding that we had some very important questions to put.

For the external territories, all waters out to 12 nautical miles will be subject to the proposed custodial penalties. The waters within three nautical miles of the coast or which are internal waters, such as bays, rivers and sounds, are subject to the fisheries jurisdiction of a state or the

                                              It has been longstanding legal practice in Australia not to impose custodial penalties for offences that are subject to strict liability. Accordingly, the Bill would amend the

                                              and TSFA on the basis that the new custodial penalties would apply only to fault based indictable offences.

                                              Having read that out on behalf of the shadow minister, I might now revert to the comments I wanted to make about those matters, in which he may even find some grounds for agreement. I have to point out that over many years in the state of
                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                                              the financial penalties that the

                                              convention required for these foreign fishing incursions always carried a rider, as they do with other offences in Western Australiaâ€”if the fine was not paid, each $50, for example, represented a day in custody. So many people have been given custodial sentences not because of the crime, which is subject to a final penalty, but because of their failure to pay that penalty.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              Whilst I support the governmentâ€”and, hopefully, the more senior officials and people involvedâ€”in respect of this outrageous situation, both environmentally and commercially, of the incursion of foreign fishing entities into our traditional waters, I must point out that for the lesser individual, the crewman, this process of incarceration has not worked. I do not want to say this in a critical sense, but the reality is that while you are in an Australian jail you get pocket money and, unfortunately, the pocket money frequently exceeds the wages that some of them would have been paid in their home state. Whilst I guess they do not enjoy the period of incarceration, they are flown home in a charter jet and with quite a bit of money.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              I was further confronted with this situation in Darwin where, after arresting the boats, the practice was to tow them into the harbour and to then leave the crew on board. The crew would be onboard in conditions which would be identical to those were they to return to their home port, because many, if not all, did not have accommodation on land in their home port; they continued to live on the vessel. Of course, they were provided with storesâ€”and might have been given significantly moreâ€”but there was pressure from certain parties to bring these people ashore and to accommodate them in a much more salubrious way. So I am pleased to say to the House that I think these penalties will be a great deterrent to the senior crew of boats that are there to collect the catches of the smaller vessels and freeze them and treat them. Whilst I think that will be an excellent deterrent, I am encouraged, after questioning the minister. that our more practical responses will be the front line of protection.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              My recollection of the former Labor governmentâ€™s administration in respect of the prevention of these fishing practices was to use Customs assetsâ€”vessels worth $10 million, $20 million or $30 million at the point of launchingâ€”to arrest and tow cockleboats into Broome or Darwin, which were the most logical places to bring them. I always had grave concerns about bringing those vessels so close to the coastline, but that was the practice of that government, as it was the previous government.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              The new policy and a lot of the new fundingâ€”and this is only a component of itâ€”will make sure we have the capacity to make arrests and that facilities for the eventual destruction of these vessels are as far away as possible from our mainland. Other vessels, of much lesser value than those that should be making the arrests, should be available for towing and for the application of other parts of the law of the sea, with which this nation must comply. All in all, it is with some pleasure that I support this legislation. I reserve my right to continue my remarks after question time and the MPI, to which I hope the people who are to speak will turn up on time.
