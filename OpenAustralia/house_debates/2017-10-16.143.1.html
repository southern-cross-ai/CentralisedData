        My 100-kay walk for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Leukaemia Foundation
        </a>
        set off last week in Sydney. We're only six days in, but already it's been a heartwarming event full of characters' stories of survival and, of course, incredible generosity. Over the next two weeks, I'll be using my speaking opportunities in the House to share some of the heartwarming tales of the walk, and I'd like to start with the events over the last three days.
       </p>
       <p>
        We started on 6 October, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         North Ryde
        </a>
        Oval, with a local leg of the Light the Night walk. Now in its 10th year, Light the Night is a unique event bringing Australia's blood cancer community together to remember and reflect during a moving ceremony and a short lantern walk. The North Ryde event was put on by my office and was just one of over 150 Light the Nights across the country. Those attending raised money beforehand to help give local families facing blood cancer the emotional and practical support that will light the way forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Light the Night fundraisers all receive a coloured lantern to carry as darkness falls and celebrate what they'll achieve to help people with blood cancer. They hold gold lanterns to remember loved ones lost to blood cancer, while fundraising to help others facing a similar challenge. Those who carry a white lantern have been diagnosed with blood cancer themselves, raising money to make a better future for those who may have to follow in their footsteps. Blue lanterns are raised high by the community that surrounds us all, funding the life-saving support services that their families or someone they know may need one day.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great event made possible by the help of the wonderful North Ryde community. Local radio star Geoff Moxham—I don't think he's a star, but he told me to use the word 'star'!—generously acted as our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and was very funny. We were especially lucky to have two cancer survivors telling their story and explaining how we can help those who are going through this difficult time. I would like to pass on the community's thanks to blood cancer survivor Robert Domone and current cancer patient Lee; you are an inspiration to everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having shaken the tin vigorously at that event, the walk started in earnest the next morning. One of my first stops was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladesville_Public_School" rel="nofollow">
         Gladesville Public School
        </a>
        . Rudely, I had told Gladesville Public that I would be there within the first two hours of their first day back after the school holidays. I was prepared for them not to be ready for me, but what a surprise I got. They had arranged a mufti day in support of the Leukaemia Foundation, and presented me with a mound of gold coins and notes. Once they were in my tin, I needed two hands to lift it—gold coins weigh a lot. This is incredible work. Congratulations to everyone at Gladesville Public School for their selfless generosity; they are leading the chance to shave my head.
