       <p>
        Members will recall that on 30 November last year protestors disrupted proceedings here in the chamber in question time that necessitated the suspension of proceedings in the House, and on the following day hung a banner outside the building. At the time, I advised the House that an investigation into the events would be undertaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the outset, I can indicate that four briefs of evidence have been referred by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Policing to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
        </a>
        for evaluation along with the recommendation that charges be laid. The briefs relate to charges of criminal damage to the leather work in the chamber gallery and the Forecourt water feature and to trespass on the facade of the building.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliamentary departments and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        are finalising a report to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        and me on the incidents and will make recommendations, including those for medium- and longer term implementation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the interim, members will note a more visible presence by the Parliamentary Security Service in the public galleries, particularly during question time. There will also be a greater presence by the Australian Federal Police outside the galleries and in Members Hall, where people obtain their tickets and queue to enter the galleries.
       </p>
       <p>
        As presiding officers, the President of the Senate and I are responsible for security at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and for the safety of all occupants and visitors. In reality, it will be difficult to eliminate all risk of protest action in the building without much more intrusive screening measures. We need to strike a balance between welcoming the public to come and see their parliament in action and ensuring that the chambers are not interrupted by a vocal but very small minority of people. We will continue to take advice and seek the most prudent balance between the ease of access to the building by visitors and the needs of security. I will provide additional updates as appropriate. I thank the House.
