        <p>
         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1) The delivery of "Project Climate Ready" was tasked to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         Disaster and Climate Resilience Reference Group by the Secretaries Group on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Risk" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Risk
         </a>
         . The Disaster and Climate Resilience Reference Group has representatives from all Australian Government departments and key science agencies. Departments participated in individual scenario exercises as appropriate.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2) The Department of the Environment and Energy led the development and delivery of scenarios for the project, in close consultation with the Disaster and Climate Resilience Reference Group. Two of the scenario exercises were managed jointly with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3) The project conducted a series of scenario exercises. These were designed to explore plausible future impacts from climate change and extreme weather events over the medium term (roughly 5-10 years).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         4) Scenarios explored some of the possible impacts of extreme weather events in a number of sectors including health, cities and infrastructure and energy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         5) The project was carried out over the period March 2017 to February 2019.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         6) The Disaster and Climate Resilience Reference Group oversaw the delivery of the project.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         7) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         8) Information on the scenario exercise reports was released publicly through a

         request in July 2019.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         9) The project was designed to explore plausible future impacts from climate change and extreme weather events over the medium term. The intention was to understand what challenges could be presented by such events, in order to inform policy and program design and thinking.
