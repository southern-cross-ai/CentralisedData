        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the Albanese Labor government providing Australians with help to buy a home, and how has this been received? What are the barriers to this help being provided?

         We are indeed trying to do our best to help Australians to buy a home through our Help to Buy scheme. I'm asked about how it has been received—shared-equity schemes—and indeed the Queensland

         We will prioritise building an incentive framework to support home ownership, examining areas including first home-owner grants and shared responsibility schemes.

          Order. The Prime Minister will pause. The member for Deakin is on a warning. He's been

           The former premier Perrottet said this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Key workers, single parents and older singles will be able to have the security of homeownership … on the government's equity share in a property.
          </p>
          <p>
           He was certainly on board. But not everyone is on board. Those opposite have a policy where they speak about having super for homes. But it has a bit of history. The former prime minister Turnbull said this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           My own view is that would be a thoroughly bad idea. It's not what the superannuation system is designed to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know those opposite haven't always agreed with Malcolm, but, on this occasion, they did. The current Leader of the Liberal Party said this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I think
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
            Malcolm Turnbull
           </a>
           has got it right. It's not good policy and I agree with him … you don't want to fuel the prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Young people need their super for retirement, not to try to take pressure off an urban housing bubble …
          </p>
          <p>
           The late shadow minister, the former member for Deakin, who has left us, said this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … inevitably all you do is push up housing prices …
          </p>
          <p>
           But it's not just them, of course, because the Greens political party are also blocking this. The member for Griffith said on Insiders:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We have enough homes for people to live in …
          </p>
          <p>
           They don't need any of that! But we went back to their 2022 election platform, and it says this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           This is why the Greens will establish a Shared Equity Ownership Scheme …
          </p>
          <p>
           That's notwithstanding the grandness in that he then went on to say that you shouldn't have to win a lottery to secure a home. But his own website says this—wait for this one:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           An example of the Greens vision for housing in Brisbane … 2,000 homes available to any Brisbane resident and assigned by lottery, rented out at below-market rent.
          </p>
          <p>
           You don't need a lottery; you just need good policy. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the
