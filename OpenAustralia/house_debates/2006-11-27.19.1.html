        There has been a tragic loss of yet another Christian leader in Lebanon. Can the blame be directed at competing Christian forces or the Jews? Not likely. Having spent time over 20 years ago with the leaders of Lebanon, I, along with all people of goodwill who want to see a bright and prosperous future for the people of Lebanon, mourn today the death of

        . I know his father. I knew his grandfather. I also knew Pierreâ€™s Uncle Bashir. There was much similarity in the life of Pierre to that of his Uncle Bashir. Pierre is now dead. What a loss. What a great shame it is that Lebanon should lose someone of his capacity and with such a future. All of Lebanon should mourn.

        Those forces working against Lebanon seem to consider that the chaos, mayhem and destruction of life and property in Iraq is the way in which residents of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        should spend their lives. I do not believe it. Most of the world does not believe it, yet the vile persecution of those who dare disagree continues. Is the only solution to sink to the depths of those who conduct these assassinations? Should all the gains of civilisation be set aside to pursue those barbarians? If Lebanon is important and if it is to survive, then the blood bond of being Lebanese should be paramount. Other countries that have survived despite massive opposition and similar destructive elements being waged against them have done so only by being unified. The answer lies in pursuing those who give the orders, not just the executioners, and removing them.
