        Today my thoughts and condolences with the

         Fo Guang Shan
        </a>
        community as we mourn the loss of the Venerable Master
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsing_Yun" rel="nofollow">
         Hsing Yun
        </a>
        . Master Hsing Yun peacefully passed away at the age of 97 on Sunday, surrounded by solemn chanting. His legacy and teachings will continue to be honoured by the followers of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha's_Light_International_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Buddha's Light International Association
        </a>
        and its parent organisation, Fo Guang Shan. Born to poor working-class parents in Yangzhou, China, the venerable master was throughout his life a teacher, a writer, a monastic and an inspiration to millions of devotees across the world. Master Hsing Yun will be remembered for his lifelong dedication to fostering talent through education and his contributions to society through charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1967 he founded Fo Guang Shan, an international Buddhist organisation famous for its benevolence and emphasis on education, compassion and peace. Through Fo Guang Shan and the associated Buddha's Light International Association, devotees and volunteers dedicate their time and efforts to improving the lives of others. Examples of their work include operating free medical clinics with mobile units in remote areas, winter relief programs to supply warm clothing and food, children's and seniors' homes, as well as wildlife conservation. Hundreds of devotees in Sydney volunteer for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        , and in 2015 their efforts were recognised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government with the Volunteer of the Year Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        By 2017, Fo Guang Shan had reached over one million followers, with temples and organisations established in 173 countries, from the Unites States to Brazil,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        and Australia. In New South Wales alone, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nan_Tien_Temple" rel="nofollow">
         Nan Tien Temple
        </a>
        spans several hundred branches, including at Kogarah, Chatswood and Wollongong. In addition to these, in my electorate of Parramatta, we're home to a large branch of the Nan Tien Temple. It's described as the spiritual home of Buddhist devotees in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , hosting several activities year round, from arts and craft classes to a Chinese language school and even a cultural exchange where interfaith dialogues are held. I am fortunate to have in my electorate a strong, thriving community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLIA" rel="nofollow">
         BLIA
        </a>
        devotees. Every day, they enrich Parramatta through their contributions, whether it be with their culture, particularly in their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Lunar New Year
        </a>
        and harvest festival celebrations, or in the charity work they consistently do for the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only is the community at Parramatta's Nan Tien Temple a fantastic representation of BLIA and Fo Guang Shan but it serves as a terrific example of Master Hsing Yun's vision and teachings. A teacher, a writer, a monastic and an inspiration to many. May the Venerable Master Hsing Yun rest in peace.
