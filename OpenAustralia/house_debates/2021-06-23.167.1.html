        On 5 June I attended the Mortdale Heights Cricket Club presentation at Moore Reserve in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurstville_Grove" rel="nofollow">
         Hurstville Grove
        </a>
        . Mortdale Heights Cricket Club is one of the very strongest cricket clubs anywhere in the Banks electorate. It was great to see Matt Boland, the president; Alexia O'Sullivan, the secretary; and all the team at Mortdale Heights Cricket Club. Every year, they have their presentation in this great spot down in Moore Reserve in Hurstville Grove. It's a beautiful place and a great location for the kids and families to get together to acknowledge the players who have done well during the year. It really is a wonderful community club.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was founded in 1957, one of the oldest clubs in the St George district. It has a very strong junior club and really strong and increasing participation from girls, which is great to see. To Matt and everyone at Mortdale Heights Cricket Club: congratulations on a another great year.

        The Oatley 101
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Artists" rel="nofollow">
         Society of Artists
        </a>
        is a tremendously vibrant and active group based, of course, in the old scout hall at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatley_West" rel="nofollow">
         Oatley West
        </a>
        . The Oatley 101 Society of Artists comes together very regularly to do art—and very-high-quality art, I must say. It has more than 200 members and was founded back in 1997. They do portraits, outdoor classes, social painters classes and a number of big exhibitions each year down there in the old scout hall. I want to congratulate Jill Hamilton, the president; Shirley Kane, the vice-president; Robyn Riley, the secretary; and Freda Surgenor, the treasurer. Thank you so much for everything you do, Oatley 101; it is a tremendous community of artists and adding a lot to our area.
       </p>

        We're fortunate in the Banks electorate to have a very strong and thriving Probus community. I think there are probably more than 1,000 people who attend Probus clubs within the Banks electorate. One of the strongest clubs is Padstow Probus, which meets down at Padstow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and was founded, of course, back in 2004. It meets on the first Friday of each month. One of the activities that Padstow Probus typically does is organise a lot of trips—interstate trips, overseas trips—but, unfortunately, that's of course been curtailed due to COVID-19. But lots of other good activities are happening in the local area, in particular in recent months when the club has been able to reconvene. To Bob Foxley, the president, and the entire team at Padstow Probus: congratulations on everything that's happening down there. It was really good to visit recently.
