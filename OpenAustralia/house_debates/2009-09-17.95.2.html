         Defence Housing Australia

        proposes to construct 97 new houses on Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . The project involves the demolition of 61 existing houses and, through more efficient use of the site, the construction of 97 houses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal forms part of an ongoing activity to replace older houses that do not meet the new and improved standards of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        housing that was introduced in 2007. Community standard housing for families is vital for the Australian Defence Force in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in the Australian Defence Force. To achieve these aims, Defence Housing Australia has a large building program in Darwin, involving the construction of 493 houses over the next four years. Most of the new houses will be built off-base in the suburbs of Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reconstruction of housing on Larrakeyah Barracks forms part of this program, both owing to the shortage of residential development land in Darwin and its convenient location to Headquarters Northern Command,

        and to the Darwin CBD. The demolition and construction works will be governed by Defence Housing Australia through a number of contractors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Works will be conducted in accordance with Defence Housing Australiaâ€™s national specification covering performance and design requirements, and in accordance with the Defence green building and waste minimisation policies. Great care will be taken to preserve both the Indigenous and European heritage aspects of the Larrakeyah Barracks. The estimated cost of the project is $52.4 million, exclusive of

       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the Enhanced Land Force Stage 2 Facilities Project at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera and other Defence bases and training areas around Australia at an estimated out-turned cost of $1,457.84 million, excluding GST. The project would provide modern, purpose-built facilities and supporting infrastructure for 8th/9th Battalion and elements of 7th Brigade as part of the enhanced land force initiative announced by the previous government in August 2006.

        , France.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes the midlife engineering services refurbishment of the Australian Embassy in Paris, at an estimated out-turned cost of $28.3 million, inclusive of French value added tax. The embassy is a purpose-built complex designed by Australian architect
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Seidler" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Seidler
        </a>
        , in collaboration with French architect
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Breuer" rel="nofollow">
         Marcel Breuer
        </a>
        . It is located within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation heritage precinct of Paris and is considered one of the pre-eminent buildings in Australiaâ€™s overseas estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The embassy consists of two nine-storey buildings, one utilised as the chancery and the other used as residential apartments. The chancery building is occupied by three of Australiaâ€™s overseas missions and numerous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        agencies. The embassy was constructed in 1977 and is now over 30 years old. Whilst it has been well maintained, many of the embassyâ€™s systems no longer provide the required level of performance necessary for a modern office environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed midlife engineering services refurbishment would address this issue, with particular emphasis on the replacement of chancery building engineering services that have reached their end of life. The refurbishment would also meet the lease obligations by refitting the building services of the embassy premises tenanted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         International Energy Agency
        </a>
        . When completed, the refurbishment works would ensure that the embassy complies with current standards and codes and would protect the investment of the Commonwealth. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in mid-2011 and be completed by mid-2013. I commend the motion to the House.

           very quickly indeed, to record my agreement with the last five notices, but I want to again record my objection to the way that notice No. 8 was treated. As a long-serving member of the
