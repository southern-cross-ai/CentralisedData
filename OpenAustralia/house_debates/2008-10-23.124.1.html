       <p>
        I am 34 years old and have the great privilege of representing the people of Moncrieff. I have lived, I must say, in relative terms, a very good life. I raise this matter because recently I received a letter from a 34-year-old constituent in my electorate. His name is Austin Canty. He wrote to me seeking desperate help to assist him with his conditions. Ever since he was born, Austin Canty has endured cerebral palsy. When he was 16 he was also diagnosed with dystonia, a disease which has no cure at this point in time and which presents him with incredible pain. He wrote to me because he is seeking assistance and support and for the Australian government to work to ensure that a website is set up on dystonia, to help find a cure and to help alleviate his pain. To read Austin’s letter is to be touched by a person who, despite incredible lifetime adversity, is doing what he can to help others. Austin Canty’s family moved from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        to Queensland seeking warmer weather in the hope that, in that warmer weather, he may in some way see the alleviation of some of his pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of his dystonia, a disease of the brain, he is on heavily prescribed medication. He is a difficult patient to deal with, as he himself acknowledges. He has said many times that he feels as if he has been a guinea pig while they have researched and attempted to find out what they could about dystonia. He is required regularly to travel to New South Wales because there is not the level of expertise and specialisation in Queensland that he seeks. His rehabilitation specialist in New South Wales has provided their personal phone number to ensure that he has access to them at any time that he needs it. He has had great support from friends and family. His parents, now ageing, are both pensioners and he has realised that it is exceptionally difficult for them, although of course they must have such magnificent hearts and such magnificent motivation to support their son.
       </p>
       <p>
        His former specialist, Professor Lance of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, who recently retired, attempted to do what he could in researching dystonia, but what is clear is that this is a relatively young man who does need support and help. He has written to the Prime Minister, to the Queensland health minister and to me as his local federal member, and I am certainly pleased to rise in the chamber this morning to talk about this young man’s experiences and to provide whatever bipartisan support can be made available to ensure that there is more research on, more support for and more understanding of dystonia and the unbelievable pain that it forces on those afflicted with it. I would urge the Rudd Labor government to work towards ensuring that resources are provided to this young man so that he can enjoy the life that lies ahead of him. I seek leave to table a copy of the letter that he sent to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
