        is implementing new technology into air traffic control towers known as the Integrated Tower Automation Suite to combine flight and operational data, surveillance and voice communications into a single, integrated, tower specific layout. The Integrated Tower Automation Suite will be rolled out progressively in towers in readiness for the civil military air traffic management system, which will provide a common platform for air traffic control in both civilian and military controlled air space. To achieve this outcome, Air Services is proposing to refurbish existing facilities and upgrade supporting infrastructure to extend design life at Brisbane and Cairns airports. The civil military air traffic management system will be installed into air traffic service centres and terminal control units and will interface with Integrated Tower Automation Suite, which is specific to tower operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Brisbane and Cairns towers were built in 1987 and 1990 respectively. The fit-out and supporting infrastructure is from the original installation and is at the end of its design life. The project is estimated to cost $23.93 million in total: $9.98 million for Brisbane and $13.95 million for Cairns excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . These costs include all construction costs, labour, external consultants, travel and an allowance for risks and contingencies. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction works for the Brisbane tower are planned to commence in late 2016 and be completed by mid-2017. The construction works for the Cairns tower are planned to commence in early 2016 and be completed by late 2016. I commend the motion to the House.

        redevelopment, stage 3A, project will include critical upgrades to electrical, water, sewerage and communications infrastructure. It will also include general building upgrades to key facilities to improve and to extend functionality essential to support current and future naval operations.

       <p>
        This functionality is especially vital considering the future uses of HMAS

        The Department of Defence is proposing to refurbish existing facilities and construct new facilities at three locations across Australia to support the introduction of 12 new

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . The 12 new Growler airborne electronic attack aircraft are capable of providing electronic warfare support by disrupting a broad range of military electronic systems. Operating in conjunction with air, land and sea forces, the new Growler aircraft will be able to support the full spectrum of defence tasks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The works are proposed at Royal Australian Air Force Base Amberley, the Army Aviation Centre Oakey, in Queensland, and at Delamere air weapons range, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . The project will provide fit-for-purpose facilities to support and sustain the operation and maintenance of the Growler aircraft capability. The project works include civil works, living accommodation, administration facilities, logistics and maintenance facilities, training and simulated facilities, multi-storey car parking, landscaping and demolition works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project is valued at an estimated $348.6 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, construction and defence contingencies, and information technology equipment. This investment will provide local employment opportunities for subcontractors in Queensland and the Northern Territory and will provide economic benefits for local businesses and industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2016, with completion expected by 2021. The government is committed to delivering world class defence capabilities to support our soldiers, our sailors and our airmen and airwomen in their roles at home and indeed abroad. The addition of the 12 new Growler aircraft will further enhance our military's capability and ability to engage in modern warfare. These proposed works will ensure that our bases are ready for the Growlers' arrival. I commend the motion to the House.

        and the Department of Defence are proposing to replace their existing air traffic control systems with the new civil military air traffic management system being delivered under the OneSKY Australia program to provide a common platform provision of air traffic control in both civilian and military controlled air space. To achieve this outcome Airservices Australia is proposing to extend existing facilities in Melbourne and Brisbane to modernise the facility and upgrade the existing supporting infrastructure to enable delivery of the new system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works comprises new air traffic service centres, which include controller rooms and amenities in Melbourne and Brisbane to house the new air traffic control consoles and associated facilities. The existing air traffic service buildings in Melbourne and Brisbane will continue to contain air traffic control support facilities and be repurposed, following the decommissioning of the existing air traffic control system, to house non-operational staff. The project is valued at $107.61 million, including GST. These costs include all development and delivery costs: management, design fees, construction costs, fittings, contingencies and an allowance for future escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed works are scheduled to commence in early 2016, with a staged practical completion and commissioning from 2017. I commend the motion to the House.
