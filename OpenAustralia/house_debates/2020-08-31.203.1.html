        It's not every community that can boast someone who has made a cultural contribution to Australia of global proportions, but not every community has a man like third-generation Brooklyn identity Ken Shadie, who passed away in June. He was the co-writer, along with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hogan" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Hogan
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornell" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , of the original

        film. 'That's not a knife. This is a knife,' is the most quoted line in Australian cinematographic history. Ken received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Academy Award
        </a>
        nomination in 1987 for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Original_Screenplay" rel="nofollow">
         Best Original Screenplay
        </a>
        , the only Academy Award for which the film was nominated. Ken was not part of the writing team for the subsequent
        <i>
         Crocodile Dundee
        </i>
        movies, and they are the poorer for his absence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before
        <i>
         Crocodile Dundee
        </i>
        , Ken also worked as a comedy writer for
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mavis_Bramston_Show" rel="nofollow">
          The Mavis Bramston Show

        and

        </i>
        . He started his career as an office boy at 2UE and eventually became the head writer at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Seven" rel="nofollow">
         Channel Seven
        </a>
        . Ken was also a foundation member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Writers'_Guild" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Writers' Guild
        </a>
        and remained a full voting member of the

         Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
        </a>
        until his death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to Ken's writing career, he served for six years in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        , and in 2015 he was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for services to film and television, and for service to veterans in his community as president of the Brooklyn

        sub-branch
       </p>
       <p>
        Ken and his late wife, Pam, were legends in the Brooklyn community, and Ken served on numerous grants committees for me. I extend my condolences to Ken's sons, Peter and Tim, and their families, as we remember his wonderful life and service. May his memory be a blessing.
