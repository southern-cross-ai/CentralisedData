       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's previous answer, where he confirmed that the minister for the workplace is responsible for administering the Fair Work Act. I also refer to evidence at Senate estimates just now from Minister Cash that both she and the minister for the workplace are responsible for administering the Fair Work Act. Is this another example of the chaos of this government, where ministers don't even know what they're in charge of? Or did the Prime Minister only make the decision to remove Senator Cash's responsibility today and not tell her?

          Sorry, the member for Gorton. The member for

           O'Connor

          stands up for workers and jobs. He does. He's doing a great job. And I have to say, the member for Gorton from time to time benefits from the incidental association with the great member for O'Connor. In the member for O'Connor's electorate, you've got plenty of miners, and they know they have got a member who defends them—not like this member for Gorton here. He stood up with the Leader of the Opposition and

              </a>
              —breached again and again, millions of dollars of fines. And there was the member for Gorton and the Leader of the Opposition encouraging those workers, those members of the CFMEU, in their vile threats against workers that were going in there and doing their jobs. But what they didn't know was that the Leader of the Opposition—and the member for Gorton, no doubt, because he backs his Leader of the Opposition to the hilt, I'm sure; the hilt or the butter knife—was getting ready to cancel the Adani licence. And the legal grounds were all set out by Geoff Cousins, and one of them related to new information about the offsets for the endangered black-throated finch. How would the workers at Oaky have responded if the Leader of the Opposition had said, 'black-throated finches of the world unite'? I don't think they would have been very impressed. He sold their jobs down the river to get green votes and, of course, a nice holiday on the
