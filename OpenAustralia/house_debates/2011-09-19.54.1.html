       <p>
        I rise in the House today to talk about Max Sanders
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFC" rel="nofollow">
         DFC
        </a>
        . Max was educated at Glen Dhu Primary School in my electorate of Bass. At 14 he started work. While still at school he joined the local cadet air training unit. In 1943 Max volunteered to join the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        and was accepted into the

         Empire Air Training Scheme
        </a>
        . After training at several bases in Australia, he went to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        to complete his training as a navigator. At the age of 19 he flew in Lancaster bombers with the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Distinguished Flying Cross
        </a>
        for gallantry in action. I encourage all Australians to read the new book by Dr Frank Madill called

        </i>
        about Max. The courage of these men in the face of almost certain death was extraordinary. Six out of every 10 officers who served died.
       </p>
       <p>
        Max and his wife, Merle, are avid supporters of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Launceston_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         North Launceston Football Club
        </a>
        , the mighty bombersâ€”how appropriate. Merle was educated at Invermay Primary School and has maintained a strong relationship with the school. She was at the recent

        opening, and her smile was almost as good as when she was watching the North Launceston premiers with a grandson playing in the team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Max, following the war, was an examiner with the Low Head Surf Life Saving Club. They have children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who all contribute to my community. On behalf of all Australians, I thank and recognise Max and his comrades for their service in bomber command and their sacrifices for us all during World War
