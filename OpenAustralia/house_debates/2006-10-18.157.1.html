        Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer diagnosed in females in Australia, but it is rare in males. It is also the leading cause of cancer death in females. In Australia, more than half of all breast cancers are found by a woman or her doctor after noticing a change in the breast. Each year in Queensland, more than 2,200 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 430 women die of the disease. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Cancer_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Cancer Fund

        recommends that, from 50 years of age onwards, women should have a mammogram every two years. Screening mammography is the best method available for detecting breast cancer early, with routine screening reducing the risk of dying from the disease by 25 per cent. All women, regardless of their age, should consult a doctor if they become aware of any unusual changes in their breasts.

        ers were encouraged to honour those whose lives have been touched by breast cancer by taking part in the Pink Walk around the Glades golf course to mark the official launch of Pink Ribbon Day on the Gold Coast. Pink Ribbon Day is a national day set aside to raise awareness about breast cancerâ€”the most common cause of cancer death in Australian women. At the official launch, the Queensland Cancer Fund joined with the Glades residential and golf resort in holding a Pink Walk last Sunday, 15 October, to raise money for vital research, patient support services and prevention and early detection programs. Gold Coast prevention and early detection coordinator Amanda Mullins said that the key objective for Pink Ribbon Day this year was to encourage women of all ages to focus on the importance of detecting breast cancer and prevention by maintaining a healthy and active life.

        Last Sunday I walked with over 300 Gold Coasters to mark and recognise the significance and awareness of breast cancer in our communities. I want to congratulate

        I would also like to acknowledge Mrs Kay Redshaw
        <b>
         ,
        </b>
        who has just been named the state winner in Queensland for the 2006 Queensland Cancer Fund challenge. Mrs Redshaw raised more than $67,000 for the Queensland Cancer Fund, which will help pay for the cancer research, patient support services and education programs we so desperately need. Kay has been working in our community as a volunteer for many years, and she deserves a huge amount of credit from all Gold Coasters for the amount of funds she has raised for the Queensland Cancer Fund. Congratulations to Kay and to all those who walked last Sunday in support of breast cancer awareness.
