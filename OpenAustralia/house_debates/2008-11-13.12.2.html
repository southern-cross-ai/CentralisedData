        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Enhanced Land Force Stage 1 Facilities Project,

        , Townsville, Queensland and other Defence bases around Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the Enhanced Land Force stage 1 facilities project at Lavarack Barracks, Queensland and other Defence bases around Australia, at an estimated out-turned cost of $793.1 million, plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . Lavarack Barracks is currently the home base for the Army’s 3rd Brigade. The Enhanced Land Force Stage 1 Facilities project will relocate the 3rd Battalion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Holsworthy Barracks
        </a>
        in Sydney to Lavarack Barracks to co-locate with the remainder of the 3rd Brigade that is already based in Townsville. To support Army capabilities, there are significant existing facilities at Lavarack Barracks and other Defence bases around Australia. Since 2007, the Army has been increasing in size to implement the government’s Enhanced Land Force initiative, and the existing facilities require modification, extension or new construction to support the increased capabilities effectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project will provide new and refurbished accommodation and training facilities, as well as common-use facilities and site infrastructure upgrades at Townsville and other Defence sites across five states. Facilities at Kapooka, Singleton, Holsworthy and Puckapunyal will provide modern accommodation and supporting infrastructure for increased Army training, whilst at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        bases Amberley, Edinburgh and Richmond, new facilities will be provided for joint enabling elements supporting the Enhanced Land Force capabilities. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in mid-2009 and be completed by late 2011. I commend the motion to the House.

        <p>
         I rise to support this motion. This is very significant for Townsville, but the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support left out a word in his speech to the parliament. He indicated to us all that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Lavarack Barracks
         </a>
         is the home of the 3rd Brigade. He did not inform the parliament that that is the ‘premier’ brigade in Australia today. Defence presence in Australia’s only garrison city, Townsville, is one of the reasons Townsville is doing so well in the current downturn in the economy. We love our soldiers and we love the men and women of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Air Force
         </a>
         . The 3rd Battalion coming to Townsville is a very significant change in the way the battalions are located. This will be welcomed by the Townsville community, and it will ensure that Defence continue to be a very significant presence in Australia’s largest tropical city. I thank the parliamentary secretary for his referral today.
