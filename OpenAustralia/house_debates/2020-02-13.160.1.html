        As a proud Sydneysider I rise to highlight the importance of one of our most loved and cherished assets, our beautiful harbour and the unique pockets of protected bushland that surround it. In my area of Warringah, I refer specifically to Chowder Bay,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Georges Heights
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Head
        </a>
        and North Head Sanctuary. These are truly iconic sites, sitting at the gateway of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour
        </a>
        . To Indigenous communities, the traditional custodians, these places are sacred, holding great cultural and spiritual significance. Over the centuries, European settlers also appreciated the tremendous beauty of these sites but saw their strategic importance for defence. Ironically, the use of these sites for military purposes meant they were largely untouched by development. As a result, in September 1998 the Commonwealth government was able to put in place a unique form of protection by creating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Federation_Trust" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour Federation Trust
        </a>
        . This statutory agency was tasked with rehabilitating former Defence and other Commonwealth lands around Sydney Harbour, conserving their natural and built heritage and returning them to the people of Australia. These lands had been hidden away from public view for many years, left derelict, run-down and, in some cases, contaminated. In his speech announcing the harbour trust, the then Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        , described Sydney Harbour as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … probably the world's greatest harbour. It is one of the great natural beauty spots of our nation. It is the cradle of European settlement in Australia and it is one of those parts of our country which gives immense pride and immense pleasure, not only to the residents of Sydney, but also to all Australians because it wins such wide acclaim around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I couldn't agree more.
       </p>
       <p>
        The creation of the trust followed years of lobbying by community groups adamant that these extraordinary places on Sydney Harbour should be maintained as public spaces and kept safe from redevelopment. These groups, collectively known as Defenders of Sydney Harbour Foreshores, included Friends of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Cockatoo Island
        </a>
        , the Headland Preservation Group and Foreshore 2000 Woolwich. Today, 22 years later, I thank them for their foresight and vision and their dedication to protect our beautiful environment. The threat was real that these sites would be developed—prime real estate with breathtaking harbour views. It was only through the hard work of those community groups and the vision and leadership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister John Howard
        </a>
        that the land was saved.
       </p>
       <p>
        But now that legacy is under threat, as are these precious parcels of unique bushland. The trust is currently the subject of a review, and the community has very real concerns that this could lead to these areas being left unprotected and ripe for development. The trust was established as a transitional body, to rehabilitate sites and hand them over to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government for inclusion in the national parks and reserves system for ongoing management. But the question must be asked: what risk does this pose to these sites and what legislative safeguards will apply? There needs to be transparency and accountability as to the future of these iconic sites. As stated by the harbour trust itself, these sites must be maintained and kept safe from redevelopment.
       </p>
       <p>
        My view, and the view of the general community in Warringah is that the Commonwealth should fund the trust on an ongoing basis to rehabilitate the sites and maintain them. These sites have great meaning for not only the people of Warringah but all Australians, due to their iconic location, their rich Aboriginal heritage, their military history and, of course, their environmental value. As they are sites of national significance, it is right and proper that the Commonwealth take ownership of their ongoing care and protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I would like to thank the members of the Headland Preservation Group, the North Head Sanctuary Foundation, the Mosman Parks and Bushland Association and the Friends of Quarantine Station. These hardworking volunteers have fought to conserve these areas, protect them from the risk of development and maintain them as sanctuaries to be enjoyed and loved by all Australians. I call on the government to honour the work of these volunteer groups, to respect the wishes of the local communities and to maintain the legacy of former Prime Minister John Howard by committing to ensuring that these iconic sites are protected for generations to come.
