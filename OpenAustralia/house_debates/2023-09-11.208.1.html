        A few short weeks ago I was joined in my electorate of Spence by Senator Marielle Smith and the Assistant Minister for Education, Senator Anthony Chisholm, to visit Playford College for Book Week. Playford College is a fantastic school located in Elizabeth in the very heart of Spence. Prior to our arrival for the Book Week festivities that morning, we stopped for a coffee at the Hopestreet Cafe &amp; Op Shop, which is located in Davoren Park. This is a cafe that gives back to the community by training and upskilling many young people in our community with retail skills and barista qualifications.

        Upon arriving at Playford College, we were given a very warm welcome by staff and students alike. Book Week is truly a magical time of the year. It doesn't matter how young or old you may be, it engenders our love for readingâ€”and helps to reinvigorate the passion for some of us who have been reading one too many committee reports or explanatory memoranda as of late! It was a pleasure to read through such books as
        <i>
         Jigsaw:

        <i>
         A Puzzle

        , and
        <i>
         Koala Ark
        </i>
        by Stephen Michael King. I'd particularly like to thank Playford College's principal, Chris Riemann; and the literacy coordinator, Samantha Collins, for their invitation to enjoy such a fantastic morning with their school. It truly was remarkable. There was a really good impromptu interview by young kids. A lot of fun was had by all.
