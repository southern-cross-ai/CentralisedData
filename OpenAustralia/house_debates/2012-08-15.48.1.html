       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge a letter that I received from one of my constituents, Eliza Vail. Eliza is in fifth class at Dubbo South Public School and has written to me about her concerns regarding litter around her community. She believes that there should be stronger penalties for people who are guilty of dropping their rubbish.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason I bring this to the attention of the House is that I think it is important to acknowledge that our younger people are interested in the democracy in which we live and are interested in the community in which they are residents. For a person of such tender years to take the time to write a letter to their federal member in an attempt to change the laws to improve the local environment in which they live I think is commendable. It is interesting to note that she has taken a leaf from her mother, who had campaigned some years ago with regard to the killing of baby harp seals, so being an activist is somewhat in the family. I commend Eliza Vail for the effort she is taking, and I encourage this House to further look at the issue of the environment in which we live and the way in which we keep it.
