        I rise tonight to recognise the efforts of some outstanding young people in my electorate of Hasluck, and I would like to acknowledge the presence of three very special young people in the House tonight. These students have been chosen as the Hasluck Leadership Award winners for 2007. They are: Arielle Cooper, from

        , Gosnells; and Matthew French, from

        . I welcome them to Canberra, to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and to the House of Representatives. As the member for Hasluck, I wanted to provide an opportunity for high school students to better understand the parliamentary process and our system of democracy, to see firsthand our national capital and to discover national politics in an environment in which they are free to form their own impressions. This led to the establishment of the Hasluck Leadership Award, with the kind permission of the Hasluck family.

        It is important for young people to appreciate the democratic principles and institutions which are the foundation of our society, and I believe that promoting and encouraging leadership qualities in our youth is an important task for all of us. The Hasluck Leadership Award satisfies both of these objectives, and I am proud to contribute to such a worthwhile endeavour. I thank those of my staff and others from my electorate who have made a significant contribution to it. I am pleased with the fantastic outcomes this award has provided to date. It has clearly demonstrated to the electorate of Hasluck how talented, how committed, how responsible and how vibrant so many of our young Australians are in our community and in our schools. There are 12 high schools located within the electorate of Hasluck and each school is asked to nominate one year 11 student who most closely matches the leadership criteria set out by the award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased to name and recognise each of these talented students who were nominated by their schools this year for the 2007 Hasluck Leadership Award. They are:

She kindly agreed to officiate at the awards presentation night, which was very well attended by parents, family, friends and representatives from each of the high schools. I thank them all, along with our generous sponsors, for their wonderful support.
