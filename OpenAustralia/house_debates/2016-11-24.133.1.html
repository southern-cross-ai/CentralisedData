        I rise today to speak about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        Parliamentary Program. I recently returned from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        , where I had the privilege to witness firsthand the work of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and women and others who form out contribution to the coalition. My visit included the ADAB and AMAB bases in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
         United Arab Emirates
        </a>
        , as well as Afghanistan and an opportunity to observe the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        operations in refuelling flights over Iraq and Syria, refuelling fighter jets, particularly over Mosul with the current conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliamentary program has been providing an opportunity for parliamentarians to experience the unique conditions in which the Australian Defence Force operates. From witnessing our next generation of leaders developing over the lake at Duntroon to our men and women deployed in the Middle East, the parliamentary program provides a vital insight into the diversity of tasks that are required to implement the will of the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week I am participating in the other side of the program, where around 16 members of our Defence Force have a chance to see the work of the parliament from the inside. I am hosting this week Major Rob Marlow from Army headquarters, who is here with me today, who is using this experience to gain an understanding of the decision-making processes within parliament, and who I worked with in preparing this speech. While I had the opportunity to train in combat first aid over in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE" rel="nofollow">
         UAE
        </a>
        , Major Marlow had the opportunity to see the work of our parliament, as well as of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee and other committee work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the ADF Parliamentary Program staff for their continued efforts to foster understanding between the parliament and the Defence Force, and I recommend that all members and senators consider participating in future programs. The Defence Force developed into its present form through a combination of deliberate change driven from the top, innovation from within and adaptation to the strategic and tactical environment of the day. Managing change driven by these volatile and often conflicting forces is not easy, but what makes it work is trust. The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program helps to build this trust and is an important component of building a mutual relationship and friendship between parliamentarians and the Defence Force. So I commend the work of Major Marlow as well as the Australian Defence Force and the benefits of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program.
