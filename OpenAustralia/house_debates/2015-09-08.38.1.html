       <p>
        Contrary to the fairy tale just spun by the member for Franklin, last weekend the Prime Minister announced a reallocation of unused Cadbury upgrade funding, which will mean a potential $72-million boost to the Tasmanian economy. Members may recall the coalition's promise during the 2013 election of $16 million to upgrade Cadbury's tourism activities in Hobart. But in March this year, the company cancelled the project.
       </p>
       <p>
        That money has now been turned into a $24-million coinvestment fund with $16 million from the federal government and $8 million from the Hodgman government. Successful applicants are required to contribute $2 for every $1 from the fund, which will leverage up to $72 million in job-creating projects. Applications will be encouraged from all industry sectors with an emphasis on tourism, agriculture, aquaculture and advanced manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said, these are areas of strength in a growing Tasmanian economy. This is a wonderful example of this state and federal Liberal governments working together to promote economic growth and create local jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under liberal governments in Canberra and Hobart, Tasmania is once again open for business and now is a great time to invest in our state. The Prime Minister has accused his Tasmanian MPs, myself and the members for Braddon and Lyons of chewing on his ears about this issue. Well, we did and I am delighted to advise the House that these funds will now be used to reinforce and strengthen Tasmania's future prosperity.
