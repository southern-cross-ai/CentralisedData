        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In light of the recent failures in Australia’s quarantine and biosecurity arrangements, would the minister provide further information to the House on the Australian government’s commitment to undertake a comprehensive, independent review of Australia’s quarantine and biosecurity arrangements?

         I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Throughout Australia there has always been a high concern to make sure that our quarantine and biosecurity services were up to scratch. If ever this concern came to the front of public consciousness, it was during the equine influenza outbreak towards the end of last year. At that point, the then government initiated the Callinan inquiry, which looked only into the specifics of the outbreak of equine influenza. As the opposition at the time, we made a commitment that there would be a full and broad-ranging review into all aspects of Australia’s biosecurity and quarantine systems. The last time a review of that nature occurred was in 1995—the Nairn review—under the previous Labor government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are in a world of increased international movements and, in so many ways, the world itself is getting smaller, which has particular challenges for our biosecurity system. In an age of climate change, we also have the problem of the migration of pests and weeds and the further biosecurity problems that come with that. We need to maintain our biodiversity, protect public health and ensure our primary industries are not further burdened by pests and diseases, whether it be outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, avian influenza throughout many parts of the world or new diseases such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
          SARS
         </a>
         . We also have to be mindful of having a review that takes into account the significant body of case law which now exists within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
          WTO
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier today I announced the commencement of that review. The review will consider the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of our quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. I also announced that this review would evaluate Australia’s current arrangements to achieve its appropriate level of protection consistent with our international obligations; look at the adequacy of the consultation and review processes currently in place; and consider other important quarantine reviews, including the implementation of the Nairn review. This inquiry will be headed up by Mr Roger Beale AO. Mr Beale has held very senior roles in both public and private sectors and is a former Secretary of the Department of Environment and Heritage. He will be assisted in that task by Mr Andrew Inglis AM, Mr David Trebeck and Dr Jeffory Fairbrother AM. Mr Andrew Inglis AM was also a member of the Nairn review of quarantine. I spoke today with Mr Roger Beale AO, and he made it clear that he wanted to ensure that there was a maximum level of community consultation. There will be a full-ranging opportunity for the community to participate in this process.
        </p>
        <p>
         I cannot begin to say how important it is to make sure that we get our systems in place so that we can make available the maximum level of protection through our quarantine and biosecurity processes. I look forward to this report coming back to me in the second half of the year so that it can inform the budget process of the following year.
