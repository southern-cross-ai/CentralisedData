        Living in a rural community can be very challenging and isolating at times, but there are some wonderful people who step up to help.

        provides a terrific opportunity for local councils to recognise the quiet but diligent work performed in their communities. I'd like to highlight one in particular today: Dorset Council's Citizen of the Year, Cheryl McCartie. A dairy farmer from the north-east town of Ringarooma, Cheryl has made her mark on the area after moving from

        over 20 years ago. She has been recognised for her tireless work in the rural community, including her role as chair of the Dorset Suicide Prevention Network. This is an open group of community members and health service providers raising awareness about mental health and wellbeing, and the factors that lead to suicide. Through contact with families and young people in the region, the network advocates for the support that the community needs. Cheryl played a key role in revitalising the organisation after a hiatus, and has led key fundraising and awareness initiatives to reduce the suicide rates in the area. These include the Out and About program, a joint partnership with Dorset Community House, that supports families and young people in the region experiencing social isolation.

        Further devoting her time to the mental health of the rural community, Cheryl also sits on the board of Farm Feast, an organisation focused on raising funds for mental health organisations, and she has been a long-time member of and contributor to Women in Agriculture. Congratulations, Cheryl, on your well-deserved recognition.
