       <p>
        Many children participate in sport in their free time, but the opportunity to pursue art, music or theatre can be out of reach. In February northern Tasmanian artist Sarah Ferrington opened the Rascal Robot Art Space in the rural town of Beaconsfield after spotting the artistic potential of local children through a community arts project.

       <p>
        The not-for-profit centre was only just up and running, offering affordable classes for local students when COVID restrictions shut them down. Sarah quickly pivoted to offering curated art packs to send out to families for their children to do at home. Each month offers age-appropriate activities, and my own children can attest to just how fantastic these art packs are. I know from speaking to other parents that these packs proved to be a lifesaver when many were home schooling, offering a great creative outlet for their children. The packs go beyond your standard art supplier's, offering

        -related activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        When restrictions began to ease, I was committed to finding a way to ensure Sarah had what she needed to get the classes back up and running as soon as possible. I wrote to the Premier and they were able to secure a state grant thanks to the Premier's Discretionary Fund, which provided Sarah with the funds she needed to ensure that her space is COVID safe. Well supported by the community, Rascal Robot is continuing to provide topnotch art classes to those in the community who might otherwise miss out. Well done, Sarah.
