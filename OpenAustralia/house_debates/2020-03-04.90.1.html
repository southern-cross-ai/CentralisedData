        My question is to the Minister for Resources, Water and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        . Will the minister outline to the house how the Morrison government is helping maintain the resilience of Australia's resource sector in the face of significant global challenges?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for their question. In the member for Herbert we have another fighter for the north on the coalition benches. I'm asked about the resources sector, and under the coalition's stable economic management the sector is absolutely booming. It is providing essential economic contributions. It's generating opportunities for current and future generations. By the numbers, there has been $33 billion of investment in 2018-19, accounting for 27 per cent of Australia's total private business investment. There are 245,000 jobs in Australia, one of the fastest-growing sectors in our economy. Weekly earnings, on average, are $2,600 a week. That is a significant and substantial contribution, more than double the average of full-time weekly earnings across the country. We have a resilient resources sector. We have mature markets, we have a quality product and it will continue to be shipped right around the world because there are markets in need that are desperate for what we supply from this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are a couple of words that make the opposition very uncomfortable. It makes them squirm in their seats. They move around. They look at their phones. The first one of those is coal. I will say it again. Coal employs 54,000 people in direct jobs in regional areas, and we know those opposite simply don't support it. It contributes $6 billion in royaltiesâ€”$6 billion towards schools, hospitals and roads. What a significant contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of whether it's critical minerals, coal or other sectors and resources, the other word that makes them uncomfortable is Adani. Those opposite didn't support Adani, but this is a business which is expanding. It has already got $750 million worth of contracts announced. That is supporting existing and new businesses in central Queensland. The Adani mine already has 200 workers on site, and 22 per cent of those, according to Adani reports, are for Indigenous workers. What a contribution to the Australian economy that those opposite did not want. We stand with the resources sector; those opposite do not. We stand with the workers in Australia in the resources sector; those opposite do not. We stand for expansion and economic growth; those opposite do not. I have probably been a bit unkind to those opposite. I know there are a few of them that might support the resources sector. They might meet once a week at the Otis restaurant.

           Thank you, Mr Speaker, but it is important to recognise, when we compare and contrast, that we stand for resources. Those opposite do not. , In fact, given your earlier ruling, I have to say that we know and we can use the hashtag 'no coal, no member for Hunter'. I couldn't use the opposite use.
