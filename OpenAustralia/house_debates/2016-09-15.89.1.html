          Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a point of order. The final part of the question asked the Prime Minister whether he would make representations. That has to be within his control and therefore has to be in order for question time.

            I understand your point about the first half, but the second half of the question very clearly asks the Prime Minister to make representations. Surely everyone in this House would agree that it would be a good thing if he did.

            <p>
             No. I have made my ruling. As much as the issues are very important and close to all of our hearts, the question is out of order. There are other ways that the member for Solomon can address the matters within the chamber, including during the adjournment debate, 90-second statements and many other forms. I can see that the Prime Minister may well wish to answer, but we have to have questions that are within the standing orders.
