        On Friday night, I attended the Seacliff Hockey Club's senior presentation night. It was a highly entertaining evening. The Seacliff Hockey Club is one of the largest clubs in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and one of the most successful. As we heard from President Daniel Roach, one-fifth of club members are either state league representatives or state league coaches. A number of junior and senior teams made the grand finals this year, although only three were victorious. I, along with the club, look forward to fewer red flags and more blue flags next year to add to the 2016 premierships won by the under-18 A men, Masters men and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        men. I also look forward to celebrating these wins at the new clubrooms that will be home to the Seacliff Hockey Club, Seacliff Tennis Club, Seacliff Sports Club, Holdfast Bay Music Centre and other community groups.
       </p>

        I pay tribute to the work done on this project, particularly by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Holdfast_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Patterson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; the sports club president, Paul Bond; and the former member for Boothby Dr Andrew Southcott. The upgrade has been made possible by contributions from the clubs and, most significantly, from the City of Holdfast Bay and a $5 million federal coalition government grant. The brand-new hybrid sand and water based hockey pitch is already in, and I had the pleasure of attending the opening in May. I look forward to attending more local, state and national games in the years to come. I commend President Daniel Roach, coaches, players and volunteers on their dedication and achievements. They are #seriouslyawesome.
