        ’ while South Korean President Lee has shown incredible patience and calm in the face of this military aggression. North Korea’s reckless behaviour will further destabilise one of the world’s most volatile regions, and comes after 46 South Korean sailors were killed in March. Recently

        North Korea is estimated to be the world’s most militarised nation with more than one in three people serving. It has become increasingly clear that the North Korean dictatorship, which is currently going through a baton change, is most likely to heed advice from our friend and trading partner, the People’s Republic of China. Bennelong embraces a very large and active community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Australians" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and I was privileged to recently welcome the new Chinese Ambassador, Chen Yoo-Ming. It is imperative for our government to use all communication channels to request China to require restraint from North Korea.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2006 a North Korean missile test led China to impose limited sanctions, utilising the heavy dependence that the North Korean regime has on aid from China. The recent events seem to have taken the longstanding brinkmanship on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Korean Peninsula
        </a>
        to a new level. We should encourage our good friends in China to engage in constructive dialogue with the North Korean regime, to repeat their opposition to North Korea’s nuclear program, and to lobby for the immediate recommencement of the six-party nuclear talks. This issue is one of the most important diplomatic priorities in our region. We are a great friend to the Republic of Korea and this year we celebrate our relationship through the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. We must all work towards a goal of restraint on the Korean Peninsula so that the good people of the Republic of Korea can live in peace.
