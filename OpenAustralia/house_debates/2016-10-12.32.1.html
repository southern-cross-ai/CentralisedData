        On the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Labour Day
        </a>
        long weekend I attended the Sydney Fiesta Cultura, one of the many activities of the Philippine Australia Sports Club, known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PASC" rel="nofollow">
         PASC
        </a>
        . PASC is the oldest Filipino association in Australia originally formed to run sporting events for early Filipino migrants way back in 1976 with the first 'Palarong Pilipino' at Turramurra. They moved onto larger events, and their work has culminated in the most recent celebration, their 28th Fiesta Cultura.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is always great fun; it is not the first time I have attended one, by any means. It is easily the largest event in the social calendar for Filipino-Australians and is the longest continual multicultural celebration in the southern hemisphere. This distinguished organisation is recognised by both the Australian and Philippines governments and has been the recipient of two Philippines Presidential Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to specifically mention the finals of the Miss Philippines Australia Pageant, because Parramatta's own Jade Crystal Wright was selected as Miss Charity Queen after raising more than $40,000 for charity. Like Jade, I would like to congratulate her mum, Cathy Snell, who has been one of her greatest supporters along the way. I am sure Jade will do a great job with her friend and newly-crowned Miss Philippines Australia, Angela Leonidas, representing both the countries that she loves and helping those in need both here and in the Philippines.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Castillo" rel="nofollow">
         Manny Castillo
        </a>
        who has been the president of PASC for 40 years—he has done an extraordinary job—and Lolita Farmer who has recently been elected as the new president. I wish them both well.
