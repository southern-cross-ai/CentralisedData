        This coming Saturday, the eastern suburbs will come to a halt when Vermont and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Croydon" rel="nofollow">
         South Croydon
        </a>
        face off in the Eastern Football League Division 1 grand final at Bayswater Oval. This is a replay of last year's grand final when South Croydon just got over the line. As a sponsor and a supporter of both clubs, it will be a slightly tough day for me. It will be a bit like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        ! I won't be picking a team other than to say we hope for a good, clean and close grand final match.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to particularly acknowledge South Croydon president, Cathy White, her team and her volunteers as well as Vermont president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rennie" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Rennie
        </a>
        , his team and his volunteers for the countless hours that they put into their respective clubs, which are both magnificent examples not just of football clubs but of community organisations that care for the community more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Ringwood Football Club, which has had a great year both on and off the field. It was disappointing to see that they just fell short in the grand final on the weekend, but I want to congratulate them on a great season. We know bigger and better things are to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to congratulate Vermont on winning the Eastern Region Girls Football League grand final. They narrowly beat
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">

        . It's wonderful to see just how much women's participation in sport is increasing, particularly in our local area, and we're very pleased that Vermont got over the line.
