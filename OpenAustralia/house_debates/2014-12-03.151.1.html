        I rise to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        and his team on winning the election on Saturday. It is an important election for Victoria and I think they have made a very good call on this election. I also congratulate the state members within my electorate—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Nardella" rel="nofollow">
         Don Nardella
        </a>
        , the member for Melton; Natalie Hutchins, the member for Sydenham; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Kairouz" rel="nofollow">
         Marlene Kairouz
        </a>
        , the Labor member for Kororoit—all three were successful in being returned with a very high vote, which is consistent with the strong support that Labor has in the region and the area that I represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that upon the election that some of the commitments made are realised. Labor will remove 50 dangerous and congested level crossings and fix the local roads that we use every day. I am pleased to indicate that the Sydenham level crossing has been announced as one of these, as has the St Auburn's level crossing. The St Auburn's level crossing is one that has been very difficult in terms congestion for that community. It is no longer in my electorate, but I certainly campaigned along with others to see a separation there. Tragically, there have been fatalities at that level crossing, and it has always been considered very high up by bodies, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACV" rel="nofollow">
         RACV
        </a>
        and others, as needing to be separated, indicating the importance of reducing danger and increasing traffic flow and reducing congestion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Western Women's and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Children's Hospital
        </a>
        is going to be built in Sunshine—with $200 million in state government funding—taking the pressure off the current services at Sunshine Hospital. It will create 2,000 jobs in construction and 500 jobs in the hospital, and it will bring much needed jobs to Melbourne's west. It is a great initiative that we would like to see realised as soon as possible. The Sunshine Hospital performs the third highest number of births of any Victorian hospital, and elective surgeries are often cancelled due to obstetric emergencies taking up theatre time. Labor plans to free up theatre space and beds at Sunshine Hospital so it can perform up to 7,000 more operations each year—that is going to be great.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new state government will also restore
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        funding. TAFE funding took a big hit under the previous government, removing the opportunities for young people to acquire skills necessary for them to find decent employment. This is a great initiative by the state Labor government and will be great thing for young people in Melbourne's west and indeed throughout Victoria. Congratulation once again to Daniel Andrews and his team—a great victory on Saturday.
