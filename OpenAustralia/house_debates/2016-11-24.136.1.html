       <p>
        I rise today to speak on behalf of some long-suffering residents who live in my electorate, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         West Beach
        </a>
        and mainly on West
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Beach Road
        </a>
        , which is a thoroughfare from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapleys_Hill_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Tapleys Hill Road
        </a>
        through to the beach. The residents, the people most severely impacted by the state of this road, have been calling for something to be done for a very long time. In the last parliament, the councils applied for Roads to Recovery funding for the upgrade of that particular road, but unfortunately they were knocked back.
       </p>
       <p>
        The road intersects two council areas: the City of West Torrens and the City of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Sturt
        </a>
        . Both councils have recognised the upgrade of West Beach Road as a priority over a number of years and have applied, as I said, for federal funding and have been repeatedly overlooked. This is despite the fact that the infrastructure and traffic in the area has increased substantially over the last 10 years, making an upgrade absolutely necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we look at the last 10 years in that area, we have seen the development of the West Beach boat harbour. It is the only launching place for a number of kilometres on the coast of Adelaide. Therefore, everyone who goes out for recreational fishing will go through West Beach Road. You will see traffic banked up with cars towing boats and caravans, bumper to bumper. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Harbour Town
        </a>
        shopping centre has opened at the end of West Beach Road, on Tapleys Hill Road. The influx of traffic that goes to Harbour Town shopping centre uses West Beach Road. West Beach Road is right next to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Airport
        </a>
        , which is being upgraded. To top it off, upgrades to Adelaide Shores sporting complex are being carried out. So you can imagine the mayhem when there are big sporting events in combination with the boat harbour, the shopping centre and the airport. I have seen photos and have actually been down there many times on a Sunday when the traffic is bumper to bumper. Residents literally cannot get their cars out of their driveways or go into their driveways on some days, so you can understand the frustration that this is causing the residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these are of course important facilities, but it is important that we take into account the residents' needs and interests, as well. These people live there. They are there every day. And every day they have to battle the traffic and the parking conditions to get in and out of their houses. It is so important that we do something to upgrade this road. I have written to the federal government and also to the state authorities and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        transport minister and urged them to take into consideration an upgrade of West Beach Road that would alleviate some of the problems for the West Beach Road residents. Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Leon Williams
        </a>
        , who has been writing to me for a long time, has sent many photographs. I urge the government to support the residents.
