         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         is, of course, the most significant single piece of nation-building infrastructure that we could possibly embark upon in order to prepare us for the needs of the 21st century. It will boost economic growth. Fact: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         estimates that, for every 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration, we can expect a 1.3 per cent additional growth in gross domestic product. For businesses it will mean lower telephone bills and enhanced business services like high-definition video conferencing, particularly in regional Australia. Consumers will also benefit with increased competition. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         found that high-speed broadband provides consumers with benefits by giving them more information about pricing and more access to competition, enabling greater choice as well as putting downward pressure on prices.
        </p>
        <p>
         It will also drive employment—25,000 jobs on average created each year because of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         . It will ensure that innovation stays on our shore rather than be exported overseas. It will increase workforce participation by enabling more employees to telework. More employees participating in telework puts downward pressure on urban congestion and reduces carbon emissions because people can work from home.
        </p>
        <p>
         So right across the board this has massive benefits. The structural separation of Telstra—the way that we have designed it—will have particular benefit. Paul Budde has said of Telstra’s decision to separate:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The fact that Telstra has made this major step forward is vindication that this industry structure is not only advantageous to the social and economic benefits of our country, but that it also represents sound economics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite took a very different approach. They took a public monopoly, turned it into a private monopoly and called it reform. They know that structural separation is absolutely vital, and that is why we are creating the NBN, a wholesale network with retail competition on top of that so that we can deliver the nation-building infrastructure that we need. Those opposite determine to wreck this nation-building reform at the same time as they say, ‘We are not really opposed to it.’ But every time they have an opportunity to vote they vote against the National Broadband Network, like they vote against all the other important infrastructure reforms of this government. I am pleased that this reform is able to proceed. The National Broadband Network is absolutely vital to Australia’s economic and social future.

         <p>
          My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to Senator Xenophon’s statement an hour ago where he says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The government has backed down and agreed to release a summary of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

          advise a joint committee on as yet unspecified aspects of the NBN rollout.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the light of that backdown, why won’t she agree to ask the Productivity Commission to advise on the fundamental question which is whether the $43 billion NBN is the most cost-effective way of delivering affordable broadband to all Australians?

          <p>
           I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I understand that the member for Wentworth is disappointed that Independent senators—including Senator Xenophon, whom he refers to—are taking a constructive approach of thinking through information, receiving information, studying the question and endeavouring to make a decision in the national interest. They are taking a thorough and proper approach to assessing a piece of legislation before them. I understand that he is disappointed by that because it is a stark contrast to what he was advocating to them, which was wreck at all costs—in order to fit in with the opposition’s strategy, wreck at all costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that in this parliament, when it has come to considering the profound micro-economic reform of structural separation of Telstra, there have been three approaches. The government came determined to deliver this major micro-economic reform to conclude 30 years of reform work; the crossbenchers came into this parliament anxious to absorb information, think deeply about the issue and exercise votes in the national interest; and the opposition came in determined to wreck. The information has always been irrelevant to them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason we never agreed with the member for Wentworth’s call for a referral to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>
           is that, just as the words came out of his mouth, he indicated that whatever the findings—whatever the Productivity Commission said—the opposition was determined to wreck. He made it absolutely apparent that, even if the Productivity Commission gave this project gold stars all over the page, the opposition would not absorb that information, that it was determined to wreck. I understand that the determination to wreck is increasingly controversial within the opposition. I understand that when the member for Wentworth sits there with a melancholy face that is because this question of just having negative approaches to everything is increasingly controversial within the opposition. I refer members of the House to an article in the
           <i>

            Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Wentworth asked a very considered question about the

             Productivity Commission
            </a>

They have made it clear that they will adhere to their position, despite internal difficulties with some members, like the member for Moncrieff, advocating positive policies and plans from within the progressive faction of the Liberal Party.

                 Mr Speaker, on a point of order: under standing order 91 how can provoking members of the opposition, in the way the Prime Minister is doing, not be disorderly?

                  I am pleased to see that the legacy of the former member for O’Connor lives on because this was a point that he put to me often. Within reason, I think that the robustness of this place does not necessarily mean that the comments that were being made were disorderly. If we had the same standing order for answers as we do for questions and we had no debate, that would help. The Prime Minister has the call.

                   Only in the Liberal Party would saying someone has got an idea be considered an insult. But there we have it—look how far they have fallen. The member for Wentworth is able to see further details about the capital expenditure of the

                     I thank the member for Makin for his question. I know the strong commitment he has to the important rollout of the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
                      National Broadband Network
                     </a>
                     and that he has been engaging with his community to ensure that they get the full benefits. But that cannot happen until we get the legislation through the parliament. It is pleasing today to see a major breakthrough whereby parliament will no longer be standing in the way of the passage of this legislation. Nor should it, because this is a major structural reform. This is the sort of reform that will benefit the nation and the sort of reform that recognises the diversity and distance that this country encompasses. Through this reform we will enhance that economic diversity and we will shrink the distance, and we will deliver better services, particularly to people in regional and remote communities. This is productivity with a purpose—to improve people’s lives and their economic opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Today’s breakthrough is important and we congratulate those senators who have been prepared to engage constructively with us to try to find the way through—unlike those who sit on the other side and simply carp, whinge and complain while blocking at every point they can. That is an opposition with no agenda and no understanding of what the benefits are for regional Australia. I suggest some of them actually get out there and visit parts of regional Australia. If they did, they would understand why regional Australia is clamouring for the rollout of the National Broadband Network.

                           Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said, they only carp, whinge and complain and never get on with the serious issues. Whether I get an invitation from the member for Fadden or not, I can assure the House that I will be getting an invitation from their regional development body. Like the other 55 bodies around the county, that body is saying, ‘We want access to the

                           because we understand what it can do to enhance our opportunities for economic diversity, our opportunities to get better services and our opportunities to value-add to the health and education infrastructure all around the country.’

                           This is a historic reform and it is only through a Labor government that it has been delivered. It is fortunate that those who sit on the crossbenches understand the importance of this and have been prepared to join with us to deliver the outcomes. I ought to say to those members who sit here and oppose so negatively, go and meet with your regional development bodies around the country and see what they have to say about connecting the nation. Do something to advance opportunity rather come into this place to simply oppose by being negative and stopping at every point. Get on the bus and come along with us.
