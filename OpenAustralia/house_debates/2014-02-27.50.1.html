        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Treasurer met with Qantas in early December last year. A massive profit write-down was announced by Qantas on 5 December last year. There has been ongoing speculation that the government would provide Qantas with a stand-by facility. Prime Minister, given the tragic loss of 5,000 jobs today, when will the speculation end? When will the government act? Will the government provide a stand-by facility to Australia's national airline?

           There are a number of things that Qantas would like. This government will do what we can for Qantas consistent with responsible economic management. We are determined to do what we can for Qantas consistent with responsible economic management. That essentially means that we should ensure that Qantas can compete on a level playing field. We want to ensure that Qantas is not competing against its rivals with a ball and chain around its leg. That is what we are trying to ensure.
          </p>
          <p>
           As for the other measure that the Leader of the Opposition has sought assurances on, the difficulty is this: what we do for one business, in fairness, we have to make available to all businesses. But I accept that Qantas wants a level playing field, and the government are determined to ensure that it gets an appropriate level playing field. In that sense at least, Qantas does need this government's help. But it also needs the parliament's help. In fact, it needs the opposition's help too. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: join with me in helping Qantas by scrapping the carbon tax and repealing the—

                <p>
                 for Qantas and its workers and their families. Indeed, it is an important day for the future of aviation in Australia. It is obviously a particularly difficult time for those families that are uncertain about their future. It is vital that Qantas works constructively with its workforce, the unions and others associated with the industry to try to make the transition that they are going through as smooth and painless as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The reality is that Qantas plays a vital role in providing air services through our nation and it will have a key role also into the future. This government and all Australians want Qantas to be a strong company in the years ahead so that it can continue to be a national icon known around the world. But the reality is that aviation is changing. New aircraft have modern technology, and so many of the jobs that were required in the past will not be needed in the future. We do not put our cars in for a grease-and-oil change every 1,000 kilometres anymore, and new aircraft are the same. They do not require the same level of service as required in the past. You cannot maintain a 747 maintenance facility if you have only eight aircraft. You cannot open up a new service facility if you have only a dozen 380s. So many of the jobs that were required in the past are not required for the future. New technology is making such a difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Qantas must work its way through these kinds of issues and ensure that it takes control of its own future destiny. The board and the management have a responsibility to the shareholders to make sure that their company is profitable and a national icon to the people of Australia and to ensure that they are able to provide the services that are required.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But there are more issues than this. The carbon tax will cost Qantas $106 million this year. Next year it will be $168 million. Honourable members opposite think that that is unimportant. Those two numbers together are more than the loss that Qantas announced today. If you look forward over the coming few years, if there were no carbon tax a good quarter of the $3 billion that Qantas want to save would be saved. That $3 billion could be saved if Labor were prepared to vote to get rid of the carbon tax. And the mining tax has similar figures. Labor can help to make Qantas more profitable.

                  My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and minister for transport. Does the Deputy Prime Minister stand by his comments of today that workers' entitlements at Qantas are responsible for some of the job losses that have occurred today? I say to the Deputy Prime Minister: is there any occasion on which workers lose their jobs when this government does not blame those very workers themselves?

                                      The shadow minister is misrepresenting my comments. I do not blame the workers for the fact that technology has moved on, that aircraft do not require as much servicing as they previously did. I do not blame the workers for that. That is simply a statement of fact. However, it is important to note that the significant losses that Qantas is currently incurring and which it has incurred over the last year or two have been in its international division. That is where the major difficulties are for Qantas. It is simply beyond dispute that Qantas is faced with the difficulty of having to compete with airlines in countries where the wage structure is very different from what it is in Australia. That is not the fault of our workers. It is a reflection of the fact that there are lower wages paid in other parts of the world. That does not mean that I am arguing that our workers should not be well paid—of course they should be. I want not just our airlines to be prosperous; I want their workers to be prosperous as well.

                                      But one of the real challenges that Qantas face is that its new competitors are not European airlines or American airlines, where the wage structures are perhaps closer to Australia's; their competitors are from Asia, their competitors are from the

                                      , where the wage structures are different. That is one of the many challenges that Qantas has to face if it is going to be a competitive airline in the years ahead. It has to find ways that it can make up for the fact that costs in Australia are higher, so that it can continue to be competitive in the future. That does not mean that the wage structure in Australia is going to change dramatically. We appreciate that those wages reflect the cost of living and the lifestyle of Australians, which we all enjoy, but it is an issue which Qantas has to address in being a competitive airline globally.
