        (1) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on older Australians, their families, their carers and the aged care workforce;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the valuable contributions made by the more than 360,000 aged care workers who have continued to deliver care and support to older Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) all aged care workers play a valuable role to deliver care and support to older Australians in residential and home care;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) many aged care workers are low paid and around 87 per cent of them are women;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the Government's decision to exclude a large proportion of aged care workers from receiving the retention bonus;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) excluded aged care workers who will not receive the retention bonus include those delivering services under the Commonwealth Home Support Program as well as in-direct care workers in residential aged care facilities including lifestyle and leisure therapists, cleaners, hospitality workers and gardeners;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) the exclusion of any aged care worker from receiving the retention bonus is unwarranted and unfair;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) on 20 March 2020 the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians issued a media release that stated the retention bonus payment would be 'after tax'; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) on 5 June 2020 the Department of Health's retention bonus guidelines stated the payment would be 'subject to income tax';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) conveys its disappointment that the Government made:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) a decision to exclude about 40 per cent of aged care workers from receiving the retention bonus; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) a late decision to switch the retention bonus from being after tax to being before tax that will see aged care workers lose hundreds of dollars they were previously promised;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider its decision and pay the retention bonus to all aged care workers irrespective of their role or where they work and to explain why it changed the rules around the payment being after tax to the payment now being subject to income tax; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges the work all aged care workers undertake each and every day and thanks them for their continued dedication to care and support older Australians in residential and home care.

        8    MR ALEXANDER: To move—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that between 1 and 2 per cent of the Australian population suffers from heart failure, with this proportion higher in Indigenous communities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges with concern the rising cost of care for the growing number of Australians with heart failure, including the duration and frequency of hospitalisation, medical management and health complications;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further notes that research from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
        </a>
        states that over 60,000 heart failure hospital admissions, amounting to over 400,000 bed days and a cost to the healthcare system of $3.9 billion are potentially preventable;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) welcomes the arrival of proven technologies, including trans catheter mitral valve repair, which have demonstrated transformative improvements in addressing underlying causes of heart failure including functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) commends the support given by clinicians, advocates, carers and families of Australians suffering from heart failure;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) welcomes with appreciation the announcement of the Government's commitment of $220 million over 10 years for the Cardiovascular Mission under the Medical Research Fund;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) acknowledges the Government's commitment to address all forms of heart disease under the National Action Plan for Heart and Stroke;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) notes the current consideration by the Medical Services Advisory Committee of transcatheter mitral valve repair; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (9) calls on the Government to ensure all Australians have early access to proven procedures and technologies, such as transcatheter mitral valve repair, where indicated, to address the rising healthcare burden and premature mortality represented by heart failure.
