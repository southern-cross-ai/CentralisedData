        women's auxiliary 75th annual conference in Ulverstone on the weekend. Founded in 1949, the organisation has been unwavering in its commitment to supporting our veterans, our veterans' families, current serving members in war zones and peacekeeping peace enforcement missions over many years. Many hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised in support of causes, both overseas and domestically. They include, but are not limited to,

        I was overwhelmed at the number of quality delegates at the meeting on Sunday, many of whom I've developed a great respect for over many years. The conference is a wonderful opportunity for those members to come together to renew lifelong friendships and forge new ones, as well as discussing important issues that affect veterans, sharing their experiences and recognising their many significant achievements.

       <p>
        You should be incredibly proud, ladies, of reaching your diamond anniversary milestone. I look forward to celebrating many more with you and supporting you in future years.
