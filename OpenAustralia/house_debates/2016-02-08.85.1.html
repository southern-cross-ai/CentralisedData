            <p>
             Before I call the minister I am going to point out at the outset that questions of this nature are problematic, and I am going to explain the thinking that I have. Standing orders make it very clear that ministers can only be asked questions about matters for which they are responsible. The
             <i>
              Practice
             </i>
             also makes it very clear that ministers cannot be asked questions about former ministerial responsibilities that they have had. It makes that very clear indeed. In fact, the member for Isaacs on 23 November asked questions of the former
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
              Special Minister of State
             </a>
             specifically making a hook to the minister's ministerial responsibilities as Special Minister of State which is why on that narrow basis I allowed the questions. With respect to the ministerial code, the minister responsible for that is the Prime Minister. At this point I do not think the question is in order, but I am happy to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business.

             <p>
              Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. It is rare—it happens a few times each year—that we have a situation where there is a question as to whether or not a minister has been in breach of the code. Parliament must be able to examine that and there is no way of examining that without asking questions of the minister himself, otherwise we would be in the absurd situation of being allowed to ask only the Prime Minister information that could only be known by the minister himself. So we are in a situation where the only way the minister can be accountable to the parliament as to whether or not he has acted in accordance with the ministerial standards is for the question to be allowed.

                  <p>
                   As you pointed out yourself, the ministerial code of conduct is a matter for the Prime Minister, not for the individual minister, so it is not possible—and nor is it appropriate, quite frankly—for the minister to answer this question. It establishes a very significant precedent, which is that members or ministers travelling on their own expense can be asked questions about their travel, whether it is overseas or domestic. This is a fishing expedition. This parliament is not a court of law. It is a parliament of the people and, therefore, this question is quite inappropriate. If the opposition want to ask the media to ask the member the question and he chooses to answer it, that is another matter but the chamber is not a place for cross-examination of ministers on areas that are not within their ministerial responsibility.

                      goes quite specifically to certain actions that can only be conducted in the official capacity of the minister. Therefore, we need to be able to ask when he said this was private whether or not he engaged in activities described in 2.20 of the

                       Mr Speaker, that point of order by the Manager of Opposition Business is an absolute red herring. If the opposition want to pursue this particular matter they have to pursue it outside the parliament and, if the minister chooses to cooperate, that is an entirely different matter. If they want to ask questions about the ministerial code of conduct then they need to ask the Prime Minister. If a precedent is established today that a minister can be asked a question about a private trip overseas, that is a very significant departure from the standing orders.

                          . I have obviously given this careful consideration and I have examined the practice carefully. For anyone who examines the practice carefully, on page 555—and I just happen to have it with me—they will see that it says, 'A minister may not be asked a question about his or her actions in a former ministerial role.' However, in a case when a minister has issued a statement referring to earlier responsibilities a question relating to the statement was permitted. There has been one case of that, in 2006. Beyond that, questions have not been allowed. That is certainly the practice and the history, I can assure the House, from the best of my research.

                          Whilst I want to see questions asked and answered, if this question had been asked some time ago, when the minister had different responsibilities, it would, clearly, be in order. But the minister responsible for the code of conduct is the Prime Minister, and it is the Prime Minister that makes the determination on whether ministers have complied with it. Having heard that patiently, and I apologise for detaining the House for so long, I am not going to allow that question and will move to the next question.
