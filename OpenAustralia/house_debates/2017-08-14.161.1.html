        On Saturday night, I attended the Sunshine Coast Business Women's Network awards at the Caloundra Events Centre. It was a fantastic night. The recipients of the various awards were: young businesswoman of the year, Angela Mansey from Kuluin Mufflers; corporate businesswoman of the year, Jodie Hedley-Ward from McGrath Caloundra; micro small businesswoman of the year, Dr Tegan Keogh from Hear Check; professional businesswoman of the year, Mervat Quirke from Bloomhill Cancer Care; and sustainable businesswoman of the year,

        from The Micro Gardener. The overall outstanding businesswoman of the year was Elaine Jobson from Jetts Fitness.

        These women and all of the finalists really showcased their skills and abilities, and I was so proud to be a Sunshine Coaster and to see such great talent from all of these women who are leading the way in business in our community. But I want to point out two women: Kim Morrison—a very good friend of mine—from Twenty.8, who unfortunately didn't get a gong on the night but was a finalist, and Angela Mansey, to whom I'd particularly like to pay a great tribute. There wasn't a dry eye in the house when she told her story about where she had come from and caring for her young son, who has
