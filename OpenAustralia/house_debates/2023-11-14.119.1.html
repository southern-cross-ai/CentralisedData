        (e) directly amend the text of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        A key feature of this bill is strengthening the quality and safeguards for the Commonwealth disability services and support being provided outside the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government is moving this amendment to the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023 to further strengthen the safeguards for people with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment elevates the application of the transitional code of conduct to eligible organisations currently funded under the Disability Services Act 1986 and the relevant items under section 32B of the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act 1997 into primary legislation, as opposed to doing it with a legislative instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional consultation on the bill following its introduction to parliament provided clear feedback that the inclusion of the code of conduct within the primary legislation was an important additional safeguard for people with disability and a valuable inclusion to make in amending this bill. It will mean that, once the legislative instruments are in place, all organisations currently receiving funding whose legislative authority would fall under the new Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023 for future funding arrangements will also have the code of conduct applied. This ensures that people with disability accessing Commonwealth disability supports outside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        can benefit from the introduction of the legislative code of conduct during the transitional period and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with the code of conduct under the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023, the entity that is a party to the agreement or arrangement with the Commonwealth will be responsible for ensuring that its key personnel and employees comply with the transitional code. The application of a transitional code of conduct to existing agreements funded under the Disability Services Act 1986 and relevant items under section 32B of the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act 1997 will increase protections for people with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will consult with the disability representative organisations, service providers and unions on the development of the underpinning legislative instruments. I commend the amendment to the House.

        <p>
         The coalition will support this amendment, which was circulated to us yesterday. Strengthening the quality and safeguards for Commonwealth disability services is obviously a key feature of the Disability Services and Inclusion (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023, and it's important to get it right. We understand and agree that this amendment will ensure that there's a level playing field, ensuring that existing service providers are held to the same code of conduct as new entrants under the new act. The amendment also ensures that Australians currently accessing Commonwealth disability supports outside the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         will benefit from a legislative code of conduct during the relevant transitional period. We are pleased that the government, at this very latest stage, has listened. We will, therefore, be supporting these amendments.
