        These amendments go to a number of the issues that I raised earlier this evening. They relate to the introduction of an income threshold on family tax benefit part B to stop families earning more than half a million dollars a year or $1 million a year from receiving family tax benefit part B. The amendments also go to providing a discretionary power to extend backdated carer allowance claims in cases where there are genuine reasons for the delayed application, such as that the carer did not know about the payment or that the caring responsibilities increased during the time that the carer had not been receiving the payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also go to preventing the government from removing places from out of school hours care services or family day care services unless those places are immediately reallocated to another service. The purpose of this amendment is to prevent a situation where places are horded by the government, where they are announced during election campaigns or during budget speeches and then sit there unallocated—sometimes tens of thousands of places at any one time. I spoke earlier this evening about how those places are frequently extremely difficult for family day care services and out of school hours care services to get. They often wait up to two years for the allocation of a place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also go to requiring the minister to report to the parliament on any transfers of child-care places between areas of low and high demand. The Labor Party is not confident and I am not confident that this system is adequate as it stands. We hear from the government time and time again that they do not know where the shortages are. I think that any system that allows more power to take away places from services in an environment where the government proudly claims not only that they do not know where shortages are but that they do not care and that it is not their responsibility to know is a system that is not going to deliver optimal outcomes to children or to their parents.

         The government opposes the Labor Party’s amendments. Particularly in relation to child care, holding a place for 12 months before it can be reallocated is a way of restricting it from being used in the marketplace—maybe unintentionally, but that would be the outcome. We are suggesting that, where there are places currently in services that are not being used and have not been used for a long period of time, those be returned and allocated so that they can be used where services have identified them. That is clearly my aim.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the backdating of the carers payment, I sympathise with the concerns that the shadow minister has articulated. It is about carers being aware of it. The amendments in fact would throw out this measure, and they miss the point of why it is able to be changed. It is because the onerous task of determining via a medical doctor what the issues are that require a carer allowance to be paid has now been removed. As I indicated earlier, I will be making major direct communications with the medical fraternity so that when a parent turns up with a child who has a disability, they are informed, ‘This is something that you may well be able to get an allowance for’ and they go to Centrelink. The issue that you raise is one that we could have addressed better in the past and I intend to address it fully in the future so that these circumstances do not arise.

         have not been Labor Party policy in the past. I would strongly suggest to the Labor Party that, in the interests of Australian families, they look at how powerful and important that money is to families and that they look at the policy they took to the last election. I commend the bill to the House.
