        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain to the House the importance of providing strong economic leadership to promote jobs and growth?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. I remember the visit we had in his electorate only a few weeks ago in which we met with remarkably innovative companies, including an Adelaide manufacturing business that is 85 years old but has secured a global niche in making cutting-edge products which are the best in the world, and it has done this entirely through innovative technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every sinew of the government is focused on delivering better jobs and greater opportunities for Australians. There is a lot of talk about economic reform and a lot of talk about tax reform. The focus always has to be on jobs and growth. That is what we are delivering—jobs and growth. We know that this is the best time to be an Australian. There have never been bigger opportunities than there are today, never been broader horizons. What we need to ensure is that, at every level, the government of Australia is doing what it can to promote jobs, promote growth, promote efficiency, promote innovation—and that is what we are seeking to do right across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that if we are to remain a high wage, generous social welfare net, first world economy then we have to be more productive, more innovative and more competitive. Australians are responding to that. They can see the enormous opportunities. They can see the opportunities that are arising as a result of the free trade agreements. Just in the last five years, services exports—education, tourism, design services and so many others—have been growing at nine per cent a year. We know that, if we are to maintain and grow our national income, we cannot rely on the terms of trade, on commodity exports, alone. They are a very important and huge part of our economy but the growth has to come from across the board.

          <p>
           What that means is that we need to have an adult and informed debate and discussion about the reforms that government can undertake. I notice that members on the other side have been running for cover whenever any changes to the tax system are mentioned. They want us to channel the former Treasurer, the member for Lilley, who succeeded only in shutting down discussion on tax. Let me say to you, Mr Speaker: we are not afraid of an open discussion. We want to see every view expressed.
