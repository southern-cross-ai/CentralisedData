        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister please update the House on what the Australian government is doing to assist the people of Burma and whether there are any prospects of political and economic reform in Burma?

         I thank the member for Page for her question because I doubt that there is anyone in this House with more knowledge of Burma than the member for Page. When I was recently in Rangoon the depth of the longstanding friendship with

         which the member for Page has had over more than a decade was clear. I commend her engagement over a long period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian people and the Australian government over the last couple of decades have focused on, legitimately, the continuing suppression of human rights in Burma. Recent history speaks for itself: crackdowns on democracy back in '88, in 1990—

           the regime then ignoring democratic elections,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" rel="nofollow">
            Aung San Suu Kyi
           </a>
           under house arrest for 15 of the last 22 years, and of course the brutal suppression of the monks back in 2007. In the last several months we have seen some change—I do not wish to overstate it—on the part of the Burmese government. First, of course, we welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi herself from house arrest. Second, after decades of military rule, we have for the first time, at least nominally, a new civilian government. Third, the president of that civilian government has made a statement on the future directions of democracy, economic reform, health, education and the rest. These are limited changes but they are changes nonetheless, and it was on that basis that I went to Burma in the course of the last several days. It was the first visit by an Australian foreign minister for about a decade, since Mr Downer went there in 2002, and the first visit to Burma by a Western foreign minister since the recent political change there.
          </p>
          <p>
           In discussions with the Burmese president I very much indicated that the first requirement of the international community is the release of more than 2,000 prisoners of conscience still held in incarceration across Burma. This must be the next and most critical step. If the Burmese government takes that step it will have an immediate transformational effect on the international community's engagement with the govern­ment. But, beyond that, more is needed: greater freedom of political operation for Aung San Suu Kyi herself, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League" rel="nofollow">
            National League
           </a>
           for Democracy and, on top of that, other democratic forces and parties. What is also required is the peaceful resolution of Burma's longstanding ethnic conflicts within the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also spoke to the Burmese president and the foreign minister about our engagement in the reduction of poverty in that country, in health and education and in other areas such as food security and agriculture. Australia now stands as the second largest donor to Burma, after the United Kingdom. That is because in Burma we have the poorest country in Asia and therefore something like one-quarter of its population of 60 million living below the poverty line. We in Australia are doing our bit.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also spent time, together with the member for Page, with Aung San Suu Kyi herself, and can I say to all members of the House who have stood in solidarity with her over the course of the last couple of decades that she wanted me to express to all members of this House her appreciation for the support she has received from this parliament over a long period of time. That is not a partisan comment; it reflects the attitude of those opposite as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           She also indicated that when she visits rural Burma in the days ahead she expects security to be provided to her and guaranteed by the Burmese government. We reiterate that call. Notwithstanding a recent letter to her from the home affairs minister warning her about her movements, she has indicated her preparedness to engage in political dialogue with the regime. We will continue to engage with Burma into the future.
