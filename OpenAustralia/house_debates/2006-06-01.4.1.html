       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes the construction of facilities at

         RAAF Base Townsville
        </a>
        , Queensland, to support the introduction of a new troop lift helicopter. The objective of the proposal is to provide facilities and infrastructure that are critical to the initial introduction and continuing operation of the multirole helicopter 90 in Townsville. The proposed facilities and infrastructure works involve a combination of new facilities and adaptation and refurbishment of existing facilities. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $20 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence late this year, with completion in early 2008, to meet the introduction into service of the new aircraft. This is another excellent facility for Townsville, where there is a very significant Army presence—as everybody knows. So many of our troops who are currently in Iraq, Afghanistan, the

        come from Townsville. The member for Herbert, a very strong supporter of the military in his electorate, would probably like to say a word about this referral as well. I commend the motion to the House.

         I support the motion because it is in Australia’s interests, it is in the interests of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         and it is certainly in the interests of the 3rd Brigade and the 5th
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Aviation Regiment
         </a>
         , which are based at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         Townsville. Over the last couple of decades, virtually all of Australia’s overseas deployments have come out of Townsville. This is where the assets need to be located, and the new heavy troop lift helicopter is no different. It will work with the 3rd Brigade and its commander, Brigadier Michael Slater, and the commander of 5th Aviation Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Prictor. This is a good facility for Townsville; there is another $20 million being invested in defence infrastructure in our city. Our community, and Townsville enterprise, warmly welcome the government’s intention, provided parliamentary approval is obtained to go ahead with this project. I thank the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">

         for the introduction and referral of this proposed work, and I certainly warmly support it.

          I must admit I did not intend to speak to this motion until the previous speaker said that virtually all our recent deployments came out of Townsville. There is no doubt that many of them have done, but to allow that to stay on the record without some correction would be to do a disservice to those members of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" rel="nofollow">
           Special Air Service
          </a>
          who have virtually been on deployment for the last several years. We have recently had in Iraq troops who came out of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          . I understand when members get very parochial about their electorates, but we in Perth too get very parochial about the soldiers, the diggers, who come out of our state and go overseas when sent by the government. I simply want to put that on the record.
