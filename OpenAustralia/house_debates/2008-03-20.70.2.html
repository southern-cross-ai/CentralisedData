        On indulgence, I just want to inform the House of arrangements which have been made in relation to

        , many relatives of those lost on the

I advise members also that the German embassy has advised us that the German government concurs with a plaque being laid over the site of the

         On indulgence, can I say on behalf of the opposition how pleased we are that the memorial service is taking place and that the arrangements are in place for people to register. In talking with people who were affected by the finding of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
         </i>
         , I have heard that it has revived many memories of their childhood and there has been a lot of turmoil in discussions between family members—pleasure has been experienced in knowing that the ship has been found but many memories have been very difficult to come to terms with—and I think the memorial service will be one where truly there can be some closure for people, and we congratulate the government on putting that in place.
