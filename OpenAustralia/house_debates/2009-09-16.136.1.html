       <p>
        I have great pleasure in rising today to speak about the inaugural Petrie Future Leaders Public Speaking and Essay Competition, which I recently introduced in my electorate. The competition was launched at the Petrie schools summit in March this year, with the final event being held in August. Entrants to the competition were required to prepare an essay on the topic: ‘If you could talk to the Prime Minister, what local or national issue would you discuss?’ There were two categories of entry—primary school students and secondary school students. Primary students were to write no more than 1,000 words and secondary students no more than 1,500 words. From these essays the finalists were selected to give a speech on their essay topic at a gala evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were 14 entrants in total—10 in the primary school category and four in the secondary school category. Essay topics ranged from animal welfare, the importance of protecting the environment, the economy, to the benefits of buying Australian-made products. Two accredited public speaking adjudicators judged the speeches. Over 60 people attended the gala evening and all of the students delivered passionate speeches that kept everyone engaged. The students schools certainly would be proud of their students’ performances on the night.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to individual trophies for the winners and runners-up, a perpetual trophy will be given to the schools, to be held until next year’s competition. The main prize was a trip for the two category winners, accompanied by a parent or guardian respectively, to Canberra to spend a day behind the scenes in
