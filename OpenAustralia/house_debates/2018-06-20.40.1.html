        There have been a lot of discussions about by-elections in this place. However, there is one that has so far gone unmentioned in Canberra. The state by-election for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Range
        </a>
        in WA will take place this Saturday, with many of its residents being my federal constituents as well. This by-election has received an unprecedented level of scrutiny, and deservedly so. Labor's candidate, Tania Lawrence, will be a strong local voice for Darling Range. Meanwhile, the Liberals are flat out trying to think of a policy to support this community at all. Tania has worked most recently as a senior manager at Woodside and has previously worked in the public sector, as well as in small business. She has a thorough understanding of the electorate she seeks to represent and she has a wiliness to achieve results for the people of Darling Range. She was even president of

        .
       </p>

        Tania has a unique understanding of the community and the lifestyle in this area. Unlike the state Liberals, she understands the importance of the need to replace the Denny Avenue level crossing in Kelmscott and to extend the railway to Byford. Tania understands the challenges that come with the semirural lifestyle of the hills and, as part of the

        state Labor government, Tania will get on with job delivery, the new Byford Primary School, better health and community safety initiatives, and protecting this unique environment. Tania will stand up for what really matters. She has my full support for the by-election that will be held this weekend.
