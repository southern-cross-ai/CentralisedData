       <p>
        I rise on this occasion to congratulate those who took out accolades at the Tasmanian Hospitality Association Awards for Excellence in Hobart on Monday night. I am pleased to inform the House that Stillwater Restaurant in Launceston won Restaurant of the Year, which is truly a testament to their excellent food and service. Stillwater is situated at the historic Ritchie's Mill, and I note that it was recently awarded a star by the
        <i>
         Gourmet Traveller's 2013 Restaurant Guide
        </i>
        . Congratulations to Bianca, James, Rod, Kim, and Craig on their success and I wish them all the best in the future in their endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stillwater was not the only recipient in Bass. I note that the Minister's Award for Contribution to the Industry was awarded to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Beaumont" rel="nofollow">
         Grant Beaumont
        </a>
        of Launceston, who has worked in the industry for three decades, which is an excellent achievement. Albert Taurian, who opened Novaro's Italian Restaurant in Launceston, was also the recipient of an award.
       </p>

        Northern Tasmania is known for its fantastic produce, especially wine. Restaurateurs are truly taking advantage of what our region has to offer. Congratulations to the 53 businesses and enterprises that received awards in a range of categories. Hospitality is the third biggest employing industry in Tasmania, and the industry as a whole should be proud of its achievements.
