        It has been about six weeks since I rose in this place to talk about Townsville's crime crisis, and I'm sorry to say: very little has changed. Despite major public outcry, houses are still being broken into, cars are still being stolen and the community isn't feeling any safer. The three state Labor representatives are sitting on their hands and doing nothing to ensure that those responsible are held to account and punished for their actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Townsville are so fed up with the city's crime problem and with not being listened to that passionate locals took to the streets just a few weekends ago to make their voices heard. More than 300 people came out in force, on a hot Saturday morning. They were carrying placards and being very clear about exactly what they wanted to achieve. The group was organised at the grassroots level by resident Julianne Wood and dubbed 'Take Back Townsville'. We marched and chanted passionately through the streets, and to quote Julianne on her Facebook page: 'We as a community are suffering. We are too scared to leave our homes, having our possessions stolen, taking our lives in our hands with the idiots that speed around in stolen cars driving down the wrong side of the streets, carjackings, attempts to stab people or someone with a bloodied syringe—just to name some of the pathetic behaviours. This is our city and I love it and we want it back.'
       </p>

        To their credit, local MPs from all sides of politics turned up to face a barrage of angry questions. But you only had to listen to the conversation for a few minutes to know that locals feel let down by their state representatives and the judicial system. I want to be clear: the police do an amazing job, but their hands are tied by the legislation. Among the locals' concerns were that there aren't enough police on the ground, as criminals are being released on bail almost as soon as they're locked up—only to commit further offences. It's a catch-and-release program that is hurting our city. The city's two helicopters, which should be reserved for their primary purposes of rescue and critical medevacs, are being utilised by police to track stolen cars, and much more. It is clear that the people of Townsville want a dedicated police helicopter.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will continue to put pressure on the Queensland state Labor government to do better, to introduce harsher penalties and to keep criminals behind bars, to make our community safe again. Even we as a federal government have introduced funding for

        cameras for local schools, communities and councils, and more lighting to curb antisocial behaviour. Townsville deserves better.
