       <p>
        Firstly, in response to the member opposite’s outrageous contribution, I am very proud to be a member of the coalition of Liberal and National Party members. All of our members, National and Liberal, do an outstanding job representing their electorates, which is why we are in government and the Labor Party is still in opposition. God help those in rural and regional areas who are ever represented by the Labor Party. The member for Gwydir and former Deputy Prime Minister has contributed outstanding service to our nation both here in Canberra and in his electorate. In terms of a code of conduct, members opposite need to take a powder, calm down and watch this space.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Tuesday 29 August, I had the pleasure of launching the Communities for Children program in my electorate of Makin on behalf of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Brough" rel="nofollow">
         Mal Brough
        </a>
        . The Communities for Children program is a $140 million initiative and is a key part of the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, with $3 million being allocated to the Communities for Children project in my electorate of Makin. The program overall supports 45 communities across the nation for local early childhood development programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main goal of Communities for Children is to assist areas such as the suburbs of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingle_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Ingle Farm
        </a>
        , Para Hills, Para Hills West,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_East" rel="nofollow">
         Salisbury East
        </a>
        and Pooraka to take a community wide and joint approach to assisting our youngest citizens and their families. In essence, the program is about community capacity building by helping to create closer links and ongoing cooperation between all the people who have a close interest in the health and wellbeing of young children. This includes families and schools, local councils, churches, clubs, businesses, community service providers, charities, volunteers, neighbourhoods and, indeed, whole communities, with facilitation and support from the federal government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Communities for Children initiative is designed to ensure that services for children and families have the flexibility to respond to local needs and are accessible to those who need support. Most importantly, it is change driven from within my own community and not imposed on them from outside. This reflects the belief that everyone has a part to play in dealing with community based issues and that the best solutions lie in the combined wisdom and expertise of a broad cross-section of people and organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the Salvation Army Ingle Farm in their role as the facilitating partner, as they are managing the $3 million allocated by the government for the Communities for Children site. The money is going towards a whole range of activities and services designed to help achieve a common vision. That vision is to have a community where all children experience the best in parenting from supported, empowered parents who are connected with a community that values early life-enhancing and intervention activities for children; parent building and maintaining positive relationships; and community services, agencies and institutions working together. That is a vision worth working towards and one that I believe other communities around the country can share. There is no doubt that the Salvation Army Ingle Farm has the background and experience to successfully make the vision a reality. But it is the reputation of the organisation for delivering services and support in such a compassionate and caring way that sets them apart and allows them to make a real difference to people’s lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Communities for Children committee in my electorate. I would especially like to thank Alan Steven, director of community services at the Salvation Army Ingle Farm, for taking on the responsibility—and it is a huge responsibility—for managing Communities for Children and for his passionate commitment to helping families and children in my community. I would also like to thank David O’Brien, the Principal of Ingle Farm Primary School, who right from the start believed in and supported the development of the FamilyZone Hub at Ingle Farm Primary. I would also like to thank all of the stakeholders, including the staff from the

        , who have put in a tremendous effort.
