        I referred this project to the Public Works Committee on 5 June 2014. The overall project cost is approximately $53.36 million, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , contingency and escalation costs, but excludes the land cost, as the land is already owned by the Commonwealth. The proposal involves the creation of a new on-base housing precinct through the redevelopment of previously developed urban land. The project will provide 80 new on-base dwellings, address in part a shortage of housing for the

        members in Darwin and improve the quality and condition of housing on the base. The dwellings are designed to be sustainable and appropriate for tropical conditions and to enhance the amenity and sustainability of the housing precinct and address current substandard infrastructure.

        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Integrated civil construction is expected to commence in October 2014 and be completed by November 2016. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its consideration and support for this project. I commend the motion to the House.

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Social Services currently leases space in multiple buildings across Woden and Tuggeranong in the Australian Capital Territory. The term of the lease of the department's main building will expire on 5 December 2016, with no option available under that lease to extend the term. The proposed fit-out of the new leased premises will provide capacity for the co-location of approximately 70 per cent of its staff based in the Australian Capital Territory. This proposal will enable a reduction of more than $7 million in annual outlays, already in the forward estimates, on leased office space in the Australian Capital Territory from 2017 onwards.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed concurrently with the base building as an integrated fit-out. The proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to commence in January 2016 with practical completion scheduled for 1 October 2016. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its consideration and support for this project. I commend the motion to the House.
