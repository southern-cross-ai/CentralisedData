       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        I was recently in Bongaree on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bribie Island
        </a>
        with Labor's terrific candidate Susan Lamb. We were visiting Island Auto Repairs, an independent mechanic on Bribie Island. Kelly from Island Auto Repairs was telling us about the problem that many residents face. Bribie Island is an older community, and many residents don't feel comfortable driving off the island. They just drive their cars on the island itself. Yet Bribie Island doesn't contain a single authorised dealer, so as a result of authorised dealers not sharing technical information with independent mechanics, residents of Bribie Island face an invidious choice: either they don't get their car fixed or they take a journey that they regard as dangerous.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a problem replicated in independent mechanics' dealerships across Australia. Independent mechanics make up at least four-fifths of Australian mechanics and yet, because our modern cars are computers on wheels containing some 20 to 50 computers, increasingly our independent mechanics are struggling to fix modern cars. That's why over a year ago I called on the government to do something about the fact that the voluntary code just isn't working for independent mechanics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
        </a>
        has backed in Labor's call for mandatory data-sharing and, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , I was pleased to stand up and announce that a Shorten government would put in place a mandatory code. Such a measure is supported by independent mechanics and auto clubs, by insurance firms and consumer groups. It's the approach that's taken in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">
         United States and the European Union
        </a>
        . It has benefits in regions such as Bribie Island, but also in rural and regional parts of Australia. No-one tells you what car to buy, and no-one should tell you where to get it fixed. Labor's mandatory data-sharing policy is good for consumers, good for apprentices, good for jobs. It ensures that independent mechanics don't go to the wall as our cars become more computerised, and it gives consumers greater choice.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd would like to commend my many colleagues who have worked and spoken with independent mechanics in their electorates about this critical issue. Speaking on the motion itself,

        </a>
        and Peter Khalil are among Labor members who have spoken with their independent mechanics about Labor's support for this critical part of our small business sector. And we know that it can be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        The critiques that were made originally by the car manufacturers over potential threats to safety, security or emissions are carefully addressed in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's report. That report lays down how it is possible to deal with these concerns while allowing mandatory data-sharing. The independent mechanics aren't asking for the data for free. They're simply saying: 'We'd like to have the data that the authorised dealers get. If the authorised dealers get the reinitialisation codes, we'd like to get them, on commercially fair and reasonable terms.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Many Australians will get their car fixed at a Kmart, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAX" rel="nofollow">
         JAX
        </a>
        , an Ultra Tune, a Bridgestone or a Pedders—or, indeed, at a non-chain mechanic such as Island Auto Repairs in Bongaree. This is why so many Australians are supporting Labor's policy. The question is why the coalition can't get out and get this done, why they've been so slow, since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        's report came down in December, to act on behalf of Australian consumers and Australian mechanics. It's an existential threat for our mechanics. They will increasingly find themselves going to the wall, as our cars get more technical, if they don't get the data they need to fix modern cars. Labor backs independent mechanics. Labor backs the needs of drivers and the needs of workers in the industry. Labor will ensure that drivers get a better deal—your car, your choice. Labor will make sure that independent mechanics have the data they need to fix modern cars. Labor is standing on the side of consumers, as we've so often done. We say to the coalition: it's time you got in the car.

          <p>
           I'm pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak on this motion today and to welcome, yet again, the member for Fenner's very late conversion to what has already been Turnbull government policy since well before he came to the party. I am very happy on this occasion to explain to him that his motion calls on the government, belatedly, to enact a policy which the Turnbull government announced explicitly, and first, more than eight weeks ago and which was developed by the Turnbull government based on a report which we supported into just this issue. I would suggest, however, that the member for Fenner think carefully before taking up any more of the Chamber's time in the future highlighting how slow he has been in recognising the report's implications and how little he achieved in this space during his six years as a member of the last Labor government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like the Turnbull government, I know how hard our independent car repairers work. My dad has been a mechanic for more than 70 years. Incredibly, after seven decades he is still working—albeit to escape mum, he says, but that's beside the point! His best customers wouldn't let him retire even if he wanted to. They know that, once you have found a great mechanic, who treats you fairly and does the job how you like it done, you never want to let them go. Whatever car you are driving at the time, you want the ability to choose the mechanic that is right for you. Not only is that ability to choose good for the individual, but it's good for everyone in that it promotes competition, encourages innovation and rewards high-quality service delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, as technology advances and proprietary software and electronic information become an ever more important part of repairing modern cars, the scales have been dramatically tipped against independent mechanics. The information needed is generally owned and controlled by the manufacturers, allowing them to deny or delay access and make an independent repairer's job far more difficult. That's why on 16 June 2016, more than two years ago, Minister O'Dwyer communicated a commitment to industry stakeholders that the government would announce an independent review of the voluntary industry agreement on information sharing within three months of the re-election of the government. In October 2016, to avoid doubling up, we met the commitment by endorsing the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           's ongoing new car retailing market study as that independent review.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ACCC's market study was released on 14 December 2017, after 18 months of investigation, 130 public submissions, site visits and a stakeholder forum. The government considered the report carefully, and—though it appears the member for Fenner was not paying attention—on 4 May 2018 the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer announced in front of an audience of hundreds at the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association Conference that the government was consulting with industry and stakeholders in considering the design of a mandatory scheme for the sharing of technical information with independent repairers. They've gone awfully quiet on the other side of the fence! It was only on 13 May that the opposition, with inexplicable fanfare, announced that they would follow the government in supporting such a mandatory scheme. As the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer told the House last week, the opposition's announcement was perplexing to the hundreds of stakeholders who'd watched the assistant minister announce the same policy weeks before.
          </p>
          <p>
           Members opposite will understand that it is necessary for us to consult widely with industry and stakeholders to ensure that this mandatory scheme is well designed, with real industry knowledge, and achieves the best outcomes. However, I'm confident that the final measures will do the job, while ensuring that the sharing of technical information with independent repairers will be on commercially fair and reasonable terms and subject to appropriate safety and environmental safeguards.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let me recap for the member for Fenner and his colleagues opposite so we can clear this up once and for all. Don't leave, Member for Fenner; listen. As far back as June 2016, the Turnbull government publicly recognised that this issue needed to be examined and addressed. We endorsed an independent review into the issue by the ACCC. We've had a working group working towards this mandatory scheme for some time. I look forward to Labor supporting the government's scheme.

           <p>
            Cars are no longer the purely mechanical and electronic machines they were in the past. Increasingly, cars have become more computerised. In the past, when you took your car for a service by a mechanic—possibly the member for Fisher's dad—they'd pop the bonnet and slide underneath the vehicle to tinker with, inspect and check various bits and pieces, and it was fairly obvious what was wrong. Nowadays, it's not uncommon for the mechanic to spend just as much time in front of a computer screen, looking at diagnostic and other technical details. The vast majority of Australian mechanics are independent operators. Car manufacturers are generally the owners and controllers of the code that provides this technical information. They are also the only source of software upgrades. Since most car manufacturers do not supply the same information to independent mechanics that they provide to authorised dealers, these mostly small businesses are at an obvious competitive disadvantage. These effects are particularly pronounced in regional and outer metro areas such as my electorate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The computerisation of cars will continue to increase as autonomous vehicles become more mainstream. In response to the arrival of automated vehicles, transport ministers in conjunction with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transport_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             National Transport Commission
            </a>
            agreed earlier this year to review and update relevant legislation. This acknowledgement that legislation must keep pace with the increasingly technological nature of vehicles is welcome, but, obviously, it doesn't go far enough. Legislation also needs to change with regard to car servicing and repairs. The current situation, a voluntary code, is simply not working.
           </p>
           <p>
            The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
            </a>
            's market study report released late last year concluded as much, saying:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            recommends regulatory intervention to mandate the sharing of technical information with independent repairers on 'commercially fair and reasonable terms', subject to appropriate safeguards to enable the sharing of environmental, safety and security-related technical information.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to the ACCC, the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association, who represent automotive parts accessories retailers and wholesalers, are pushing for reform. Stuart Charity,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
             Executive Director
            </a>
            of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA" rel="nofollow">
             AAAA
            </a>
            , said in December, after the release of the ACCC's report:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Australia's 17 million car owners and more than 20,000 independent automotive repairers deserve better than the current situation that finds the car manufacturers routinely and deliberately preventing consumers from exercising choice and their consumer legal rights …
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why Labor is proposing a mandatory obligation to provide the technical information at a fair cost. This mandatory code will have no cost impact on the Australian taxpayer. The fair and reasonable fees mechanics will need to pay to access the information will be covered by the administrative costs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ACCC will act as an independent umpire to ensure access to information, as well as costs, is fair and reasonable. We also asked the ACCC to conduct a postimplementation review to ensure the policy operates as intended. Similar reforms have already been enacted in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">
             United States and the European Union
            </a>
            . More competition means downward pressure on prices, which means more money in the pockets of Australian car owners. This is just another example of where we, Labor, are addressing cost-of-living pressures for hard-working Australians.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to these changes, Labor will also protect penalty rates, cap private health insurance rises and address the housing affordability crisis. We will do this because we know that $20 a week or more is being paid for private health insurance by families, that there's $40 extra a week in childcare fees and that the Medicare freeze continues to hit people in their pockets. These changes will also increase the demand for aftermarket parts, a sector that's been struggling since this government effectively ran the car-making industry out of the country.

            We've been calling on the government to take action for a year now, but it would appear the government's only priority is tax cuts for big business. They don't care about the small businesses, and they don't care about cost-of-living pressures. If need be, we will again hold the government to account and make sure that small businesses are able to compete on a fair playing field, and that consumers get the right to choose where their car is serviced and get the value for money they deserve.

            <p>
             In contributing to this debate, I've listened to the contributions of other members and wish to point out that the coalition government has already taken measures to address this issue. Advances of automotive technology, particularly in the era of electronics, have revolutionised the performance and capability of vehicles on Australian roads today, delivering greater fuel efficiencies, power, driver assistance and safety systems.
            </p>
            <p>
             Onboard computer systems and proprietary software are now features of most modern vehicles. Mechanics and vehicle technicians now use handheld computers plugged into a vehicle's communication port under the dashboard, via a data cable, to read diagnostic trouble codes and make tuning adjustments to the vehicle. These devices are relatively easy to operate and vehicle enthusiasts routinely use these programmers to diagnose and improve the performance of vehicles. I personally use a handheld Superchips tuner for my Ford F-250 pickup. It plugs into the data porta and provides a diagnostic digital read-out of the vehicle's sensors, allowing me to tune the engine and transmission to optimally suit various conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vehicle manufacturers generally own and control the intellectual property and technical information required to repair and service new cars. Access by independent mechanics and repairers to technical information, equipment and electronic codes required to effectively compete in the vehicle servicing and maintenance market can be denied or delayed by vehicle manufacturers. By restricting access to proprietary software or through data encryption on the part of the vehicle manufacturers, consumers are forced to have their vehicles serviced and maintained by the original vehicle manufacturer or authorised dealerships, often at premium prices, preventing other competent and suitably qualified mechanics from competing in the servicing market. It is similar to other electronic devices, which can be electronically locked to restrict use in particular regions or countries, such as mobile phones, subscriber boxes or gaming consoles. Consumer protection laws have been amended to allow accredited third party service providers to service and repair automotive vehicles without voiding the manufacturer's warranty. This issue is very similar in facilitating access by independent service providers to the technology and software required to service and maintain vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
             The coalition government has acted upon a commitment made before the last federal election to protect the interests of consumers by opening the vehicle servicing and maintenance market up to fair competition. The

              Australian Competition and Consumer Commission

             completed a market study which was released on 14 December 2017 after 18 months of investigation and consultation. It has focused on competition and consumer protection issues in the sale, regular maintenance and repair of new cars.

             </a>
             received 130 public submissions, conducted site visits, held a stakeholder forum and a round table, and directly consulted with a wide variety of stakeholders. The government is now considering the design of a mandatory scheme and how it might operate. In considering the design of the scheme, the government is actively seeking to offer consumers greater choice for getting their vehicles serviced or repaired, especially in remote and regional areas; setting out clear expectations for manufacturers with respect to information sharing on fair and reasonable commercial terms to allow independent repairers to compete on a fair and equal playing field; protect vehicle security, environmental and safety information; and facilitate adequate dispute resolution where the independent mechanics and repairers may be experiencing difficulties accessing information.
            </p>
            <p>
             The coalition seeks to introduce legislation that maintains high standards of vehicle maintenance and protects intellectual property rights for vehicle manufacturers yet opens up the servicing and maintenance market for fair competition by third-party service providers for the benefit of Australian consumers.

              Let's cut to the chase after all that gobbledegook we've heard from the government, all the excuses about round tables on round tables, committees on committees and reports into reports—I don't want to stand in this parliament one minute longer; I want to get to the real issue of what mechanics and the small businesses in Australia want. They want the government to take action. It's all very well to have lectures from the government saying: 'We've looked into this for a couple of years. We're going to make a determination. We're going to take a review.' Five years into government and they've done nothing. Go and talk to local mechanics in their electorates. They'll tell you what you've got to do. They know. So, instead of making excuses and trying to come up with some way to not make the decision, you need to go and listen to what the industry is saying: listen to the peak body, listen to the small businesses and actually listen to the mum-and-dad operators. That's what I've done as a local federal member.
             </p>
             <p>
              I start today's debate by congratulating and acknowledging the member for Fenner and the Leader of the Opposition,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
               Bill Shorten
              </a>
              , for their advocacy and leadership in this area because we believe, Labor believes, that consumers should have choice about where they get their car serviced, and that's what they will get under Labor's Your Car, Your Choice policy.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the cars, utes and vans of the 21st century become more sophisticated, particularly with motoring technology, we know that the role of a local mechanic and service centre is not what it once was. We know that this information is getting harder and harder to access—you don't have to be Einstein to work that out. Instead, more and more car and vehicle manufacturers are holding back the information from local service centres. Presently, car manufacturers generally own and control technical information, and in many cases are the only sources of re-initialisation codes and software upgrades. This means independent car repairers, who comprise the majority of Australian mechanics, are at a competitive disadvantage. I know this because I've met and spoken to them in my own electorate.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also invited the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Treasurer to meet with small businesses in my own community. I was really proud that they both took up that opportunity and sat down with businesses and asked: 'What do you want government to do? How can we fix this problem?' That is what real leadership is about—not hiding behind reports, not hiding behind round tables and not hiding time and time again, which is just delaying.
             </p>
             <p>
              I speak about people like Ian from Mr Spanner's Automotive in my own electorate at Sumner Park and Scott from Future Auto Sumner Park. I know how much this would mean for local businesses like them. Scott told me that not only would it allow his local business to better service local residents but it would also be a huge win for our local economy as he could employ more mechanics and more apprentices to apply their trade.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd also like to particularly acknowledge the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association for their leadership in this area. I know that they’ve been talking to members of the government. I know that they have been dragging them kicking and screaming. They just want to see some action. For all the talk about jobs and growth, we're not seeing any movement whatsoever in this sector. They’ve been at the forefront of this push, and I would like to thank particularly their executive director, Stuart Charity, and his colleagues, Lesley Yates and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
               Nigel Bishop
              </a>
              , who have been 100 per cent supportive of this change to look after our local mechanics, their employees and, perhaps most importantly, the local residents who have their cars serviced locally.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know that the current system just isn't working. Motorists and local service centres are getting ripped off by the big players. This was clear from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
               ACCC
              </a>
              inquiry into the car retailing industry, whose final report was released in December last year. It concluded that the industry's voluntary code has failed. It has failed to address the problem and as a result it is hurting small businesses. There are increases in prices for consumers, providing less choice, with the impact, interestingly, being felt most in regional areas. So there has been a comprehensive review of the industry and recommendations which would result in fairer competition and benefits for every Australian household and, more importantly, for every independent repairer.
             </p>
             <p>
              They argue that this is already a voluntary code and it needs more time. However, the voluntary code is three years old, and the ACCC report found that many manufacturers refused outright to conform to the code, while others used loopholes to withhold information from independent repairers. So, today, I call on the government to adopt Labor's Your Choice, Your Car policy of mandatory information sharing, which could require car manufacturers to share technical information with independent mechanics, so the independent mechanics and mum-and-dad operators in my community will get a fair go and so that consumers will get a fair go, because they deserve choice and they simply aren't getting it from the Turnbull government.

               There are so many wonderful small and family businesses in my electorate of Boothby, including cafes, retailers, hairdressers, florists, newsagents and so many more. These businesses are owned and run by hardworking individuals and families, and they are contributing to our community and to our local economy. I am proud to be part of the Turnbull government that supports small businesses to be more competitive, to grow and to employ hardworking Australians.
              </p>
              <p>
               Under the Turnbull government, company tax has been cut to its lowest rate in 50 years for small businesses, at a rate of 27.5 per cent for businesses with a turnover of up to $25 million this financial year, extended to businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million in 2018-19. The Turnbull government has also provided an instant asset write-off for businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million. But, despite all this, there are still some small businesses in my electorate and across Australia that are subject to anticompetitive market behaviours, particularly in the automotive repair and servicing industries.
              </p>
              <p>
               I recently visited local automotive repairer Blackwood Dyno Tune &amp; Service in my electorate, where I met owners Ricky and Michelle Monserrat. They explained to me how a lack of data-sharing by the car industry is impacting their business and reducing competition in the sector. New car retailing is a significant part of the Australian economy. In 2016-17, approximately 1.1 million new vehicles were sold across the nation, at more than 1,500 new-car dealers. Data indicates that buying a car and its ongoing maintenance accounts for around five per cent of average annual household expenditure.
              </p>
              <p>
               Car manufacturers generally own and control the technical information required to repair and service new cars—and so they should. They have invested the money and the effort in developing and building their vehicles at great cost; it is, therefore, only fair that they control their intellectual property. However, it is not fair that they deny access to this intellectual property if they're provided with fair and reasonable remuneration for the information.
              </p>
              <p>
               In December 2017, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
               </a>
               report into the car retailing industry concluded that independent repairers in the Australian market had 'limited access to service and repair information from vehicle manufacturers'. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                ACCC
               </a>
               concluded that this had resulted in reduced competition and an artificial monopoly in the market. The ACCC also found that consumers were confused about warranty and servicing requirements and that this was compounded by statements made in manufacturers' logbooks and service manuals. This can result in consumers choosing not to use independent repairers to repair or service their cars due to the perception they'll be voiding the manufacturer's warranty. Ricky and Michelle from Blackwood Dyno Tune and Service, together with the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association, have expressed to me their support for the ACCC recommendations that Australia introduce a mandatory code for repair data and information sharing, similar to schemes adopted in the United States and Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
               As part of a government that supports small businesses, competition and consumer choice, we have listened to these concerns, and we have acted. In early May, the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Sukkar, announced that the government is considering the design of a mandatory scheme and how it might operate here in Australia. I'd like to take this opportunity to commend and thank the assistant minister for his commitment to business owners like Ricky and Michelle in my electorate, whose livelihood is affected by these policy decisions. I'm delighted that the government is seeking to implement a scheme that sets clear expectations of industry and allows independent repairers to compete on a fair and equal playing field.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the same time, though, we must get the balance right. Due consideration must be given to ensuring that commercially fair and reasonable terms for car manufacturers are included in the scheme. These terms should recognise the investment made by these companies in developing the technical information and the vehicles in the first place. We must also seek to protect vehicle security, environmental and safety information. That's why the Turnbull government is undertaking extensive consultation with industry and stakeholders and looking to the international experience to ensure that we get the scheme right. That's responsible government. Those opposite don't seem to understand the meaning of that term. And it appears we are on the right track. Our proposed policy on access to service and repair information is so popular that it seems that those opposite are now seeking to introduce it for themselves. I just want to congratulate the assistant minister again on all the work he has done.

               <p>
                I'm really pleased to speak in support of this motion moved by the member for Fenner, and I wholeheartedly congratulate him on the excellent work that he's done in consulting with the independent repair industry and coming up with what is a credible policy and a clear alternative to the government position that does clearly support those small to medium-sized businesses that operate in the mechanical repair industry in Australia that are finding it difficult to access information from the larger repairers in repairing cars for the average Australian. Really, it comes down to: whose side are you on? Whose side are you going to support? Are you going to support those smaller businesses that are struggling to make ends meet, that exist on shoestring budgets and really are in it for the love of the industry and the trade and that are trying to access that information on behalf of their customers to repair their cars and are being given the run-around by some of the larger dealerships that withhold this information simply because they can, to make life difficult and draw people back to the dealerships to get their cars serviced?
               </p>
               <p>
                We all know that modern cars are computers on wheels. They contain many different digital files and codes, which vary from car to car. Car manufacturers generally own and control that technical information and are the only source of that information when it comes to either updating the software or repairing the car and making sure that it's roadworthy into the future. Unfortunately, in the consultations that we've had with those who work in the industry—and I've consulted with a number of them in my local community—the independent repairers and mechanics working in the smaller workshops believe that the larger repairers and dealerships are unreasonably withholding information, making it more difficult, more time-consuming and, ultimately, more costly for individuals and families to service their cars and pushing up the cost of the average car service.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most people get their cars repaired and regularly serviced through independent mechanics, of course. We all know that we want to go to our local mechanic. When you need to get your car serviced, you want to go to someone that you know and trust, someone that you can build up a relationship with, particularly when you're talking about something that the average Australian wouldn't have a clue about. I know that most Australians looking under the bonnet of a car and talking about detailed technical information wouldn't have a clue about how to repair some of the difficulties that we have with cars. With the computer information that's contained in most cars these days, it's become harder and harder. So those independent mechanics should be able to access that information on commercial terms to ensure that they can efficiently and effectively repair cars for their customers.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've consulted many of those independent mechanics in

I want to particularly thank Silvio from Alex's Auto Services in Botany and Angelo from Torrisi Automotive in Matraville, who have done a wonderful job in supplying me with the necessary information and background to make an informed decision about this and, indeed, to question the

               <p>
                The ACCC conducted an inquiry and handed down a report in December last year. The report indicated that the voluntary code that the government have implemented simply isn't working. Many of the large dealerships simply ignore it or make it difficult for some of the independent smaller repairers to access that important information. Labor has listened to those independent repairers who repair so many family cars and small business cars throughout the country, and we say to them: we will act on your behalf. The government aren't acting. They're refusing to listen to your concerns and do something about it. But Labor will act if we are elected.
               </p>
               <p>
                We will require car manufacturers to share with independent mechanics technical information on commercially fair and reasonable terms. But, at the same time, we will ensure that we are protecting the environment and safety features of that information. A thorough consultation has been undertaken in respect of this. We've acted on the advice of ACCC, and the member for Fenner, as the shadow minister with responsibility for this issue, has travelled around the country hearing the advice of those mechanics and has put this policy in place. It's a policy that Labor is proud to take to the next election.

                   I'm glad you spoke, because it's obviously a win-win-win situation. We want to protect the intellectual information of major car companies—we understand that—but we also are a population that's been very used to having our local mechanic, and the world has changed. I wondered why the battery in my Territory went flat. They said to me: 'Russell, the situation is that there are so many technical features drawing off that battery that they only last a couple of years now. They don't last 10 years like your last battery. They just don't last anymore.' I accept that there have been massive changes in the automotive industry, and Australia is changing accordingly. We want the best of both worlds: we want wonderful cars and at the same time we'd like to still have that tradition of going to our local service centre, dealing with our local small business, which is part of the community, and giving them our business, as has been described today. The debate has been one that I've listened to, and what they're saying is: it doesn't matter who you elect at the next election, your local mechanic's going to get a fair go. I think I've summed up what I've heard pretty well, and we can now close this debate down.
