        On 15 August, I had the honour of attending the Toowong
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        's service to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It was an opportunity to pause, reflect and acknowledge the service and sacrifice of almost one million Australians who served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . COVID-19 has been incredible tough on some of our RSLs and on our defence community. I know that many were so very disappointed that they couldn't come together to commemorate Anzac Day this year, as they normally do with their mates over a beer at the RSL. It was great to gather for this anniversary instead and to pay our respects together. I had the privilege of presenting a commemorative medallion to Mr George Hulse, the President of the Toowong RSL. Mr Hulse shared with me his thoughts on the importance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        conflict. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to read this to the House. He said: 'World War II was the largest conflict in human history. It caused 70 million people to lose their lives over a six-year period and changed forever the geopolitical structure of the human race. The outcomes of that war continue to be experienced to this day, and we who benefit from a great continuation of our legal rights, civil liberties and human dignity owe a great debt to those who made these things possible for us at a difficult time during their youth.'
       </p>
       <p>
        While Australia can never repay the debt that we owe to those who serve, the medallions—as I said, the first of which I gave to George—are a small but meaningful way to thank veterans for their service to our country. The medallions that the federal government is rolling out demonstrate our recognition of the significant contribution of our World War II veterans to the lifestyle and freedoms that we all enjoy in Australia today. The Morrison government is committed to providing support, compensation and welfare assistance to our defence and veteran communities right across Australia. I'm particularly passionate about providing it in the electorate of Ryan. Locally, I've been proactive in securing funding for organisations that assist our current and ex service men and women and their families, as I know the vital role these groups play in supporting the electorate of Ryan and our veteran community, particularly those who call the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Gallipoli Barracks
        </a>
        home.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was recently pleased to announce that two RSL branches in my electorate have received federal funding under the Building Excellence in Support and Training program. The Kenmore Moggill RSL received $1,284, and the Gaythorne RSL received $44,898, both to assist our veteran and Defence community by providing support and resources to ex-service people and practitioners, as well as advocacy work for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We owe so much to those who have served our country. By providing these medallions as well as funding to support them in their post-service life we are supporting them as best we can. We say thank you to them every day for their service.
