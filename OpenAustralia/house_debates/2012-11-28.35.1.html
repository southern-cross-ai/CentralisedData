        I rise to call attention to a local children's charity which operates in my electorate called Foster Care Angels, which I have been pleased to assist recently in obtaining deductible gift recipient status. It was founded by Kelly Doyle and her husband Glen, who live in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Langley" rel="nofollow">
         Kings Langley
        </a>
        . They founded it last year after firsthand experience as crisis foster carers gave them some insight into the trauma faced by local children and young people entering the foster care system. As former respite foster carers ourselves, this is an issue that is very close to my heart and the heart of my husband as well.

        When children are removed from their homes and placed into foster care, they often leave with few or no personal possessions. Foster Care Angels helps to ease the transition of children entering foster care in the western suburbs and hills districts by providing them with a care package. These are distributed via local fostering agencies. In addition to practical items, they also give children a sense of self-worth and independence. Items selected to be included in this comfort pack include toiletries, baby needs, school supplies, educational products and something to read and play with, and these are contained in a backpack or library-type bag to keep.
       </p>

        Foster Care Angels is now endorsed as a public benevolent institution and holds

        status, as I mentioned. They are 100 per cent volunteer-run and rely solely on donations and fundraising efforts to continue these services. I raise this to draw them to the attention of anyone tuning into the broadcast. They can go to fostercareangels.org. If you are looking for a worthwhile Christmas present, you need go no further than assisting this wonderful organisation to help kids in need.
