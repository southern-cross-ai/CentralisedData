        The New South Wales Liberal government's treatment of local councils is well documented, and recently councillors in Sydney and Wollongong have had their planning powers removed. In light of this, residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horningsea_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Horningsea Park
        </a>
        in my electorate have a right to be concerned about a proposed development in the suburb of Bringelly by Nulon motor oils which would be 200 metres from their door. Many residents have raised concerns with my office expressing strong opposition. Despite the site being zoned as light industrial, the proposed factory will manufacture and store motor oils and aerosols, using hydrochloric acid and highly combustible liquids. Liverpool council also is opposing the development, saying it will pose a serious risk to the community and the environment.

        While I strongly support Australian companies creating jobs in Werriwa, zoning laws exist for a reason. I support the local residents and council in their opposition to this development. This type of manufacturing should not be allowed so close to residential properties. The proposal would see the factory built on the edge of the Western Sydney Parklands, which have been described by the Greater Sydney Commission as the lungs of Sydney. I call on the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment to consider refusing this proposal and to work with the company and the council to find a more suitable space for this development. However, given approvals recently of the intermodal and the concrete recycling plant adjacent to homes in Moorebank, I share the residents' concerns.
