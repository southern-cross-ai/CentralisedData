        <p>
         Mr Speaker, it is an honour to stand here today and speak in this chamber as the first ever Labor member for Blair. I am keenly aware of the trust, duty and obligation bestowed upon me by the people of Blair. They voted decisively for change on 24 November, delivering a 10.2 per cent swing to Labor. With emphatic purpose they chose a better way. They voted not for fear and pessimism but for hope and optimism. They voted not for the past but for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of us elected to this parliament have brought with us our own stories. We have been influenced by genetics, geography and our life experiences—some that we have enjoyed and some that we have had to endure. My story begins in the heart of Blair, as a young boy growing up in Ipswich. As a boy I went to Ipswich East State Primary School and completed my high schooling at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundamba_State_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
          Bundamba State Secondary College
         </a>
         . This was a pretty big achievement in my family because high school was an educational opportunity denied to both of my parents and their parents before them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I started my working life as a part-time cleaner at Dinmore Meatworks. I studied arts and law at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          University of Queensland
         </a>
         , an opportunity afforded me by a Labor government—the Whitlam government—for which I will always be grateful.
        </p>
        <p>
         My father was a meatworker and my mother was a shop assistant. On my father’s side my ancestors were farmers from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Lockyer Valley
         </a>
         and on my mother’s side railway workers from Ipswich. I was born and raised in Ipswich and, as far as Ipswich is concerned, I am a local through and through, having lived there all my life. In my childhood, I was exposed to the twin evils of addiction to alcohol and gambling. I lived through the poverty caused thereby and the pain of the divorce which followed.
        </p>
        <p>
         After university, at the age of 26, I entered the business world, practising law as a partner in my own firm. Along with my business partner, Matthew Turnour, the brother of the new Labor member for Leichhardt, we built Neumann and Turnour Lawyers, a small to medium-sized law firm in the heart of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_CBD" rel="nofollow">
          Brisbane CBD
         </a>
         . I thank Matthew for his support over many years and the friendship we have shared since university.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having practised in most areas of law, I became an accredited family law specialist in 1996. I have conducted thousands of cases, many of them involving complex property settlement disputes, and matters involving dreadful domestic violence and shocking child abuse. This has led me to hold a deep belief that the rights of children should be protected and that the law should allow women to control their lives and destinies both physically and financially.
        </p>
        <p>
         I bring to my new elected role 24 years as a practising lawyer, 21 years of business experience, towards a decade as a health community councillor and 14 years as a Queensland Baptist Care board member—an organisation associated with three aged-care facilities, a drop-in centre and a community centre, all in the Blair electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Twelve years ago I was an ordinary branch member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         in Ipswich. The catalyst for my increased political involvement, both organisationally and in campaigning, was the election of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson" rel="nofollow">
          Pauline Hanson
         </a>
         as my federal member in March 1996. I lived in Oxley at the time, Blair having not yet been created. For some, Pauline Hanson’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         Party was something to be sneered at from afar. For me it was local and it was personal. I witnessed firsthand the destructive impact of One Nation, with its intolerance, bigotry and economic irresponsibility. I witnessed families and friends torn apart by the rise of Hansonism. I saw former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister John Howard
         </a>
         dog-whistling and engaging in wedge politics for his own political advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
         That’s why I resolved to do something about it. I became the Labor Party’s campaign director in the state seat of Ipswich and, along with many others, we turned the tide locally. In the late 1990s in Ipswich and the Lockyer Valley, Labor’s main political opponent was One Nation. In fact, my predecessor in Blair was first elected on Labor preferences to prevent Pauline Hanson winning Blair. Today, in a curious twist of fate, I am now Pauline Hanson’s federal member of parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 1 March 1962, in his maiden speech,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hayden" rel="nofollow">
          Bill Hayden
         </a>
         , whose then Oxley electorate bears a striking resemblance to Blair today, said of his election to represent Ipswich and its surrounding rural areas:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This is truly a great privilege, but the greatest of all honours is to be here as a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . The Australian Labor Party is the only political party in Australia today which can claim to be truly national in character and outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
         As always, I concur with Bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank former Ipswich mayor Des Freeman and his wife, Colleen, the former Ipswich state MP and Queensland Treasurer David Hamill, and former opposition leader, federal Treasurer and Governor-General Bill Hayden for the influence they had upon, and their support for, this working-class boy from Ipswich. As a child, I learnt that the union made us strong and that Labor gave us hope. I am proud to have gone into two election campaigns as a candidate with a Labor Party membership card in one hand and a union ticket in the other. I am proud to be a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Services Union
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I am a Christian. To paraphrase the Prime Minister: my faith is the compass which grounds my life. I have been deeply affected by leaders whose concerns were not just for the spiritual wellbeing but for the material improvement of humankind. I reject utterly the notion that God is a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. Having said all this, I respect those who hold views which may differ from my own, and I hold firmly—in a good Baptist tradition—to the separation of church and state.
        </p>
        <p>
         What do I believe? I believe in reconciliation with our Indigenous peoples. I believe in a republic with an Australian head of state. I believe in multiculturalism. I believe in equal rights for women. I believe in civil liberties. I believe that the rights of the Australian people should be protected by a bill of rights. I believe the law must be utilitarian. I believe the law must help, not hurt. I believe that law and justice must not meet furtively, illicitly and occasionally. They must be married. They must be one and they must be never rendered asunder. I believe there must be better access to justice in Australia. Access to justice must not depend upon one’s economic resources. The real decline in legal aid funding in this country is a national disgrace. As a lawyer, I have witnessed many people compelled to settle cases or not pursue their rights for reasons of cost alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this country we have too much law and not enough justice. Many acts of parliament could be measured by weight not words. Exhibit 1: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law Act
         </a>
         and its rules and regulations. Exhibit 2: the legislation governing child support, its assessment and collection. These acts need overhaul and simplification. The acts governing these areas now resemble the Income Tax Assessment Act in all its complexity. And these are the laws which, more than any, affect hundreds of thousands of Australian adults and the children who find themselves in the difficult circumstances of separation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need greater transparency in the appointment of those who deliberate in these jurisdictions. Judges and federal magistrates are all too often appointed with little transparency, sometimes without proper consultation, occasionally without possessing the necessary qualifications and legal experience, and every now and again without the sympathy required to deal with people at their most vulnerable. I am pleased with the federal Attorney-General’s recent announcements that the Rudd Labor government will appoint an independent selection panel to improve transparency in judicial appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe society needs a strong safety net. I believe that how we treat the poor, the aged, the weak and the disadvantaged says much about us as a nation. I believe that the market can and does create wealth, but it does not have all the answers. I believe the Australian experience shows that economic development, social progress and equality of opportunity come not just from the liberty of the individual but by the active participation of government also.
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe in a pragmatic, progressive Labor Party dedicated to practical policies to help people and not longing for some utopian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jerusalem" rel="nofollow">
          New Jerusalem
         </a>
         . I believe in a Labor Party that brings both labour and capital together. A Labor Party which unites, not divides. At the last election, many people voted Labor for the first time in their lives. Placing their trust in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         and Labor, they chose a better way—and we did here, just over a week ago, when we faced our past, apologised for what was done and looked to the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         I acknowledge and pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land upon which we meet and of the lands of Blair—the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul peoples—and I thank them for their care of the land, for the pride of their culture and for the enduring strength of their people. I hope and pray that the apology tendered by this parliament and the historic Indigenous Land Use Agreement signed with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Ipswich City Council
         </a>
         on 30 January 2008 will assist to heal the hurt and build a common future in Blair.
        </p>
        <p>
         Blair is a regional seat, taking in the shires of Gatton, Laidley and Boonah and about two-thirds of the city of Ipswich. It is named after local Aboriginal singer and one-time Labor candidate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Blair" rel="nofollow">
          Harold Blair
         </a>
         . Since its creation in 1998, the electorate of Blair has moved further across Ipswich. In the last redistribution, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
          AEC
         </a>
         excised the rural areas north-west of Ipswich and included to the south rural Boonah, stretching down to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         border.
        </p>
        <p>
         Boonah’s main industries are beef cattle, farming and tourism. I am proud to have sponsored the very popular arts festival run by the Boonah Arts Collective, and I will do so in the future. The Lockyer Valley adds $450 million per annum to the Queensland economy through its horticultural industry. With future railway electrification, the building of a new prison, the expansion of the University of Queensland campus at Gatton, the delivery of the western corridor recycled water pipeline to the Lockyer, and new housing estates, this is a fast-growing region. I am pleased that the Rudd Labor government will inject $408 million into the delivery of the water grid and pipeline by the Queensland government.
        </p>
        <p>
         My home town of Ipswich could and should have been the capital of Queensland. Ipswich is one of the oldest yet fastest-growing cities in Queensland. ‘Big enough to make a difference but small enough to care’ is the oft used local slogan. Ipswich is growing. It has taken Ipswich 150 years to reach a population of 150,000, but in the next 15 years it is projected that another 150,000 will be added. The Ipswich of yesteryear struggled as its traditional industries of coalmining, railway workshops and woollen mills declined. But Ipswich has fought back. It now boasts two universities, a thriving high-tech aerospace industry, an ever-expanding
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         base at Amberley and many industrial parks. It has a world-class water treatment plant at Bundamba and a gas-fired power station at Swanbank. Its railway museum in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ipswich" rel="nofollow">
          North Ipswich
         </a>
         is legendary, and its art gallery is the most visited regional art gallery in Australia. Three days after the election, on 27 November, Ipswich was awarded the international title of ‘the world’s most liveable city’ for its size—although I do not think that had much to do with me being elected three days before.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, for many years now, the missing link for Ipswich and its surrounds has been federal funding. The most obvious example of the financial neglect by the previous coalition government has been the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
          Ipswich Motorway
         </a>
         , linking Ipswich with Brisbane. This four-lane national highway is at its capacity, with up to 100,000 vehicles using it per day. For 11 years, the coalition government steadfastly refused to fully upgrade the road. The Ipswich Motorway is not just congested; it is unsafe, and it has held back the economic development of the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         People talk of ‘parking’ on the Ipswich Motorway—they put stickers on their cars about having parked there. It is the bane of their lives. It is the source of frustration for tens of thousands of Ipswichians who commute every day to jobs in Brisbane—and I was one of them. Inexplicably, my Liberal predecessor opposed the full upgrade of the motorway from Ipswich to Brisbane, instead wasting years by running interference on this vital issue. We will fix the Ipswich Motorway. We will fully upgrade the Ipswich Motorway to six lanes and build a network of service roads to take intersuburban traffic off the motorway.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wish to pay tribute to the member for Oxley,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Ripoll" rel="nofollow">
          Bernie Ripoll
         </a>
         , for his years of campaigning on this issue and for his support in the Blair campaign. I look forward to working with him in the years ahead as a neighbour. For me, fixing the Ipswich Motorway and achieving much needed improvements to other federal roads in Blair are high priorities. Locally, I am enthusiastic about the Rudd government’s promises, including the redevelopment of the Ipswich CBD, the redevelopment of the Ipswich Tennis Centre and Ipswich Basketball Stadium, the Cabanda Aged Care project in Rosewood, the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre, a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         super clinic, a Defence Families Health Care Clinic, and three years of ongoing funding for the Ipswich After Hours Clinic. These last three commitments concerning health are particularly important for Ipswich, as our area has a ratio of one GP for every 1,609 people.
        </p>
        <p>
         I welcome the Rudd government’s ‘education revolution’, the determination to tackle the challenges of climate change, the efforts to confront the cost of living pressures experienced by Blair families and the will to tackle the problem of homelessness. Since the election I have visited numerous homes and services provided by dedicated local people seeking to help dispossessed individuals and families. This has had a profound effect upon me. Talking to people such as staff at Hannah’s House, which provides short- and medium-term accommodation for young girls in difficult circumstances, and Booval Community Centre, which provides practical assistance and accommodation at numerous locations in the Ipswich area for families who have fallen on hard times, it is hard not to feel emotional about the plight of these fellow Australians and anger at the failure of the previous government to acknowledge the crisis and do something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Undoubtedly, the biggest issue in Blair in the recent election was
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         . This unfair, extremist agenda was rejected by the people of Blair comprehensively. No matter how long I am in this place, my proudest day will be the day I finally see the back of Work Choices and have it replaced by Labor’s simple, fair and flexible system. Never again must one group of Australians be placed in a position to exploit another group just because a government pursues its ideological obsessions. It demeans us as a nation and it is offensive to our belief in a fair go for all.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would now like to thank the many people who helped me in the campaign—although, regrettably, time does not permit me to name every one. I would like to thank Jim Nilon, the Coordinator for Blair of the

To the fabulous Labor women of Blair who staffed the campaign office and helped out with the postal vote campaign: thanks. I had the curious experience of having women as all the key personnel in the Blair campaign. Many was there a time when I was the only male in campaign committee meetings. The Blair campaign was fraternal, feminine and familial.

Thanks to my father, Al Neumann, my mother, Joy Butler, and her husband Rob, for their love, loyalty and commitment towards me and in the campaign. I thank my parents for instilling in me what I consider to be true Labor values of social justice, equality of opportunity and compassion for others. I have always believed Labor values are family values. To my best mates, my brothers Regan and Darrin, thanks for your encouragement, dedication and help over so many years. To my wife, Carolyn, who has shared more than half of my life, I say thanks for your love, faith and hope in me.

I have come here to make change. I have come here to advocate for the causes in which I believe. I have come here to represent my local community. I have come here to deliver for the people of Blair. I have come here to serve and honour the greatest political institution in this land: the Australian Labor Party.

          I rise in the House today to make my contribution to the address-in-reply debate. In doing so, I will start by congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your election to your high office in our parliament and wish you well throughout the 42nd

          </a>
          . I want to remark today on the recent federal election, governments past and present, and, most importantly, put forward an agenda for reform of our representational system.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 24 November last year the people of Aston, who are the cornerstone of Australia, re-elected me to be their representative in this place for the next three years. To all the people of Aston, I say thank you for granting me a mandate. I take this opportunity to place on record my firm commitment to serve and strongly advocate for them not just in this place but in whatever forum I can to assist them in their daily lives. Further, I take this opportunity to sincerely thank the many people who supported my campaign for re-election last year. To my dear family, I say thank you. To my dedicated and hardworking staff, I say thank you. I say thank you, of course, to all of the Liberal supporters in Aston. Your combined efforts were obviously instrumental in the election success we achieved in Aston.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 24 November last year the people of Australia elected a new government. As a result, our nation has now entered a period of great uncertainty. Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I welcome the parents from Aston who have just entered the public gallery here this morning. This new government has already benefited from a situation that we in the coalition could not enjoy when we came to office in 1996. When we won office in 1996, Australia was in a devastating economic mess. Government net debt was out of control, unemployment high, fiscal policy in a shambles and inflation skyrocketing—just to mention a few key economic variables. This newly elected Labor government has inherited a nation and an economy that is envied by all for its resilience, its success over the past decade and the potential it promises into the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our economic success over the past 11 years has centred primarily on macroeconomic performance and fiscal strategy, microeconomic reform, streamlining the tax system and developing our international engagement capabilities. Since 1996, our nation’s strong economic growth, our low inflation and huge decline in unemployment have contributed to a significant and meaningful increase in the living standards of all Australians.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since 1996, real
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
           GDP
          </a>
          has grown at an annual average rate of 3½ per cent and market sector productivity has grown at an average annual rate of around 2¼ per cent. Inflation has averaged 2½ per cent since 1996 and over two million jobs have been created. Importantly, for Australians, real wages have increased by over 20 per cent and the unemployment rate has been halved from 8.2 per cent to around 4.1 per cent. It is fascinating to note that, as a result of the coalition government’s strong economic management, the proportion of the working age population with a job is at an all-time high—that is, of those people who can work, more do so now than at any other time in our history.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the greatest achievements of the coalition government, of course, was the repayment of Labor’s $96 billion of debt, which they left to the Australian people as an unwelcome legacy. It is staggering that the previous Labor government was so economically incompetent that they racked up $96 billion of debt, costing Australians in excess of $8 billion per year in interest costs alone. That $8 billion per annum is now directed to the benefit of the people of Australia. Mr Speaker, on indulgence again, I see the children of Park Ridge Primary School have now entered the public gallery. As I mentioned earlier, it is a wonderful and fantastic primary school in my electorate of Aston.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a result of the recent election, much of the success and significant improvements made by the previous coalition government is now at risk. It is at risk because you cannot trust Labor with managing the economy. I have said in this place previously that the past is an important indicator of the future. Labor’s economic track record at the federal level is an ominous warning, I think, of the damage that could be inflicted on Australians under this new government. For my part, I will do all I can to minimise the negative impacts that could flow from their policies over the time ahead and ensure this new government is held accountable for their action and inaction.
         </p>
         <p>
          Regardless of our political differences, once an election is over Australians move forward in the style and spirit that makes this nation such a great place to be part of. The drive to continually improve oneself and the nation is constantly with us. There will always be much work to do across the entire country and it falls to each individual to contribute to the positive development and prosperity of Australia. With this in mind, there are many issues that I have observed in my time in this place which I believe are in need of review. I want to stress that my observations are in no way a reflection on the good work of past or present parliamentarians; rather, these observations are about the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are elected not only to represent but to lead. It is in that vein that we are able to better serve the people of this great nation. In this debate, I have decided to focus on the way in which we represent our respective constituents. I have chosen to do this because it is through this forum that the voices of our communities are heard and acknowledged. There are constitutional changes that I believe would significantly improve our system of parliamentary democracy. It is my view that the term for the federal parliament should be extended from three to four years. My view is based on two key observations. Firstly, given the electoral cycle and the way governments typically operate within this cycle, I believe that a three-year term induces an opportunistic approach in the government of the day. Rather than taking a more long-term and mature view to policy decisions and implementation, the current term of three years does not provide sufficient time for consideration or execution of policy decisions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Secondly, the current three-year term flies in the face of reason when compared with the four-year terms that are mandated in state parliaments. Over many years the scope of the federal parliament has broadened to be more encompassing than at any other time in our history—perhaps even beyond the intent of our founding fathers. As such, over the past century state parliaments have been gradually constricted with regard to their role and responsibilities. It is absurd that the federal parliament has assumed more responsibilities over the years but has less time to discharge those responsibilities with due diligence.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under our current system, which we have slavishly followed from the Westminster tradition, a person can hold the office of Prime Minister indefinitely so long as the majority of the members of this place support that person. Whilst this system obviously has its benefits, one might ask: is it truly the best option available? In consideration of this question, my attention is drawn to other democratic nations who have prospered and the manner in which executive power is held in those countries. Nations who limit the tenure of a head of state or government include the United States of America and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
           Russian Federation
          </a>
          . Countries that have been blighted by dictatorial regimes, such as those in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America" rel="nofollow">
           Latin America
          </a>
          , have introduced a limited tenure to prevent dictatorships forming again. The evidence to support a limited tenure approach is impressive and provides a compelling argument for its implementation in those countries.
         </p>
         <p>
          I believe that in our case, if this approach were adopted, there would be many benefits for Australia. The most prevalent of those are the mandated renewal of executive leadership, the diffusion of power from one individual to several over a period of time and the consideration of and the ability to implement new ideas for the benefit of the nation. Therefore, I submit that the future lies with a maximum set period of three parliamentary terms for any individual Prime Minister. This would mean that under a four-year term a Prime Minister could serve a maximum of 12 years. My approach to this matter is not jaded by a partisan view. Rather, it is motivated to ensure the high office of Prime Minister is enhanced and strengthened.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I have suggested previously, innovative concepts and fresh ideas spring from constant renewal and regeneration combined with experience of what has and has not been effective. Like any important organisation or institution, I believe best performance can be derived from those who accumulate diverse experience over a period of time. Traditionally the practice has been that cabinet ministers are appointed to a portfolio at the discretion of the Prime Minister and are infrequently removed or changed from that portfolio. Whilst this traditional practice has served the nation well—and I am not reflecting on any former or, indeed, any present cabinet minister in any way—I ask the question: is this the best form of governance? One alternative procedure could be that a minister in the cabinet could only hold the same portfolio for a maximum of two consecutive parliamentary terms. After this, the Prime Minister of the day would be required to allocate a new cabinet portfolio to the minister or the individual would be required to leave the cabinet. This approach would ensure that the cabinet over time would be significantly strengthened due to the depth, breadth and practical experience of cabinet members.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our current system provides the Prime Minister of the day with total and complete discretion for the calling of a general election at any time. In keeping with the train of logic I have outlined, I believe the people of Australia would be better served with a set term of three years and a final 12-month tail end that offers flexibility for the Prime Minister to call the general election in that period. This approach effectively enlists the best elements of the fixed term argument, in that it provides greater certainty, with the best elements of the current approach, which provides flexibility to the incumbent.
         </p>
         <p>
          Compared to many of my colleagues from both sides of this chamber, I have served in this place for only a moderate period. However, in this comparatively short period of time I have drawn the conclusion that reform is possible to rejuvenate the operations of this place. I believe that it is necessary to strengthen the independence of the office of the Speaker so that it is not only above reproach but seen to be above reproach. Mr Speaker, I say this without any reflection on you or on any person who has ever occupied the chair. My proposal is straightforward. Upon the election of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, the incumbents would be required to immediately suspend their political party membership and would be prohibited from actively participating in any party political activities throughout their respective speakerships. Upon the calling of a general election, the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker may seek the endorsement of any political party and stand for a seat in this place. This proposal is aimed at ensuring and protecting the integrity of these high offices within our parliamentary democracy.
         </p>
         <p>
          As exemplified in the title of the Speaker, I believe that names and titles can carry profound importance in our society. When one hears a name of an office or title, one immediately conjures up varied impressions as to the role, the responsibilities and the real meaning of what that person or group seeks to achieve. In our system the alternative government has always been referred to as the opposition. According to the
          <i>
           Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary
          </i>
          , the word ‘opposition’ means ‘resistance, antagonism or the state of being hostile or in conflict or disagreement’. From a purely logical perspective, this suggests that the party in opposition will oppose for the sake of opposing. I ask: is this truly serving the best interests of the Australian people? One might argue: what is in a name? I respond by pointing out the importance we attach to names and titles, their subsequent impact and the unconscious effect they have on people. I put to members of this place that renaming the pejorative title of ‘opposition’ to a more aspirational title, such as ‘the minority party’, might profoundly alter the expectations of the Australian people. The Australian people could be encouraged to expect positive alternative policies to be generated with greater frequency than is traditionally expected from the opposition. Further, the opposition would not be automatically expected to rally against every endeavour of the government of the day. It is hoped this approach would generate a more constructive environment in which policy and action are honed for the benefit of Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          I believe we have reached a crossroad. The Australian people expect us to reach beyond our party political positions to achieve the best outcomes for the national good. To that end, I propose that a bipartisan eminent persons advisory group be established. This group could be under the auspices of the Speaker of this place and the President of the other place. The group could undertake nationwide consultations and report to the parliament on recommendations for visionary and invigorating reforms to our system of representation.
         </p>
         <p>
          I should point out that I greatly admire and respect all those who have been elected at any time to serve and represent their constituents in this and the other place. My intent is simple: these proposals are about improving the process of our representational system for the benefit of Australia now and into the future. I offer all these observations in good faith. I hope that my suggestions strike a chord of resonance with honourable members who may share my will for achieving reform to benefit succeeding generations.

            In rising to address this chamber for the first time in this address-in-reply, I pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land where the parliament building stands, the Ngunawal people; I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the office of Speaker; I acknowledge the service of my predecessor,

           <p>
            Very few people are afforded the privilege of serving in the nation’s parliaments. Fewer still are elected for the first time when a consequence of their election is a change of government and a validation of their values and beliefs. I am astonished and very humbled that in my life I should be given that opportunity twice, firstly in 1989 when the Goss government came to power in Queensland after 32 years of coalition rule, and now with the election of the Rudd government. I am greatly honoured that the people of Longman have placed their trust in me on this occasion, and to them I say this: I am here to put your collective interests first. I am sincerely grateful for your support and I will work tirelessly on your behalf in order to retain that support.
           </p>
           <p>
            The federal division of Longman was created in 1994 and first contested in 1996. I am just the second person to represent the electorate. Longman is named for Mrs Irene Maud Longman, the first woman elected to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
             Queensland Legislative Assembly
            </a>
            , who represented the electorate of Bulimba from 1929 to 1932. Mrs Longman was nominated to stand for parliament by the Queensland Women’s Electoral League in a seat that was expected to be easily retained by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
             ALP
            </a>
            incumbent. She was then also endorsed by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Progressive_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Country Progressive National Party
            </a>
            . Her election came after many years of public advocacy on behalf of women and children, a role she resumed after her unsuccessful election bid in 1932. By all accounts an excellent parliamentarian and local member, Mrs Longman was nevertheless quite poorly treated by her male colleagues, excluded from the parliamentary dining room and kept standing outside the Premier’s home—her own party leader’s home—when she visited to discuss parliamentary business. Her enlightened social views often drew favourable comment from the Labor opposition of the day, which may have contributed to the fact that her prospects for re-election were torpedoed by Premier Moore’s electoral redistribution.

            Exceptional population growth in south-east Queensland has ensured that the Longman of today is quite different to the Longman of 1996. The divisional boundaries have contracted greatly, with virtually all of the rural areas once included in Longman now part of other electorates. Successive redistributions have seen substantial areas of the Lockyer and Brisbane valleys and

            to Bribie Island, in the Longman electorate, nearly a quarter of a century ago. We love it there. It is where we raised our daughters, Casey and Tai, and they attended local schools. It is an area I represented proudly in the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1989 to 1998. It is also well understood that Carryn has been a member of that same parliament since 2001 and had previously been a councillor on

            . We do not think it is unusual that people with a shared interest in politics should marry. We do accept that it is unusual that we should be serving as elected representatives simultaneously, in our case for a second time. It is unusual, but study will show that it is not unique.
           </p>
           <p>
            Family is everything in any walk of life, and in this profession it is especially so. Carryn and our daughters provide me with a great well of love, encouragement and support, for which I thank them from the bottom of my heart. Our daughters endured a great deal as the children of politicians throughout their childhood and teenage years. They have sacrificed much more than most people could imagine while their parents engaged in this demanding occupation, and despite those trials they have each grown to be wonderful young women of whom we are both very proud. I am delighted that Carryn and Casey are here in the gallery today and I am sorry that Tai’s lecture schedule prevents her from being here also—but I am pleased that she is studying anyway!
           </p>

            Carryn’s mother, Ivy Lill, passed away in 1990 but was always there to help us both as our political involvement intensified in the early years. My parents, Keith and Patricia, are both deceased, but it is from them that I learned that public service is an honourable profession. My sisters, Jan and Penelope, and I grew up in a home where politicians were respected no matter which party they represented. As it turns out, that was just as well because the Sullivan household of our childhood was a conservative household. Dad, a bank officer, stood twice for the

            state elections, beaten by the ALP both times, firstly in Castlereagh in 1953, and then narrowly losing in Dubbo in 1956. Unfortunately he had passed away before I was elected to the Queensland parliament, but my mother was a tremendous sounding board for me the whole time I served in that parliament. I know she was proud of me then, and I know she would be doubly proud of me today.

            There are so many people who need to be acknowledged for their part in the campaign to wrest Longman from the former government. I owe a great deal to the candidates who preceded me as Labor candidate in the electorate in earlier campaigns—Pat Bonnice in 1996, Ian Burgett in 1998 and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Beckett" rel="nofollow">
             Stephen Beckett
            </a>
            in 2001 and 2004—and those who helped and supported them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today I want to particularly acknowledge Ian Burgett. Ian had contested the seat of Fisher in 1993, and in 1998 went within a whisker of winning Longman for the ALP. Ian died suddenly last April and his passing has been a great loss to his wife, Michelle, daughters, Ruth and Jane, and their families, for whom he was a loving father, father-in-law and ‘Pappa’. He is missed too by his colleagues at the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union and by the union members he served so diligently. He is missed by his colleagues in the ALP, who looked to him for guidance in all local campaigns. He is missed by his community, where he volunteered his time so generously, and who will, in a little over two weeks time, dedicate a park to his memory. And he is missed by me. I would have enjoyed having him along on this journey and I know he would have taken great satisfaction in the election outcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            This week is Organ Donor Awareness Week, a time when we particularly urge people to sign up as organ donors and to discuss this important issue with their families so that their wishes are clear. Ian’s family was one that had had those conversations and, as a consequence, organs and tissues donated by Ian have assisted many others in need. As his daughter told those gathered at Ian’s funeral, at the height of our own grief as family members there are those who wait for us to save their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            More than 300 local ALP branch members, supporters and friends contributed to my campaign for Longman in one or more ways. Clearly it is impossible, as many other speakers have already indicated, to name them all, and I know that not a single one of them contributed a single minute in the hope that they would get a mention in
            <i>
             Hansard
            </i>
            . Nevertheless, it would be unforgivable if I did not mention one or two. My sister Jan, who is also in the gallery, has always been one of my heroes, and in 2007 she came through for her brother, big time. For 10 weeks Jan managed my campaign office, juggling, as capable women seem to be able to do with ease, the responsibilities of the campaign office and another major project simultaneously. Without Jan’s input we would not have sailed as smoothly through the final weeks as we did. Carolyn Duncan and Brenton Higgins too spent long hours ensuring that every activity had as many campaign workers as was needed and that they were briefed.

            Everybody associated with our Longman campaign was saddened by the passing on 9 February of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Swallow" rel="nofollow">
             Richard Swallow
            </a>
            . Every campaign has someone like Richard, the bloke who will happily walk many kilometres ensuring election material is delivered, who will spend hours on street stalls, who will ensure that election signs are in place and any vandalism rectified. Despite his previous work as an adviser to the Tasmanian Labor government, Richard nevertheless understood the necessity of these less appealing tasks and was happy to be the one to see that they were done—by doing them himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard complained of stomach pains shortly after Christmas last year and was diagnosed with an asbestos related illness as a consequence of ingesting the bloody stuff. He died only a matter of weeks after first becoming aware that he was ill. However, in his final weeks he expressed his admiration for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Banton" rel="nofollow">
             Bernie Banton
            </a>
            and the countless number of campaigners who over 30 years stood up for what was fair and just for the victims of the asbestos industry, and fought to ensure that it was forthcoming. In Richard’s case, that was within a fortnight of the lodgement of his application. We will miss him and our thoughts are with his wife, Lesley, and their children.

Although it was clear that I would be the candidate most likely to benefit from their activities, I have to admit that it felt strange in the beginning that this was a campaign into which I had no input and which I could not direct. I want to pay tribute to the indefatigable

            For the last nine years I have kept myself busy with involvement in a number of community organisations. Until I was preselected to contest the seat of Longman I had been the Chairman of the Caboolture Business Enterprise Centre, established by the Goss government when I was the state MP. CBEC provides business advice and consultancy services, operates an employment agency, operates a training organisation, provides contract services to government delivering business and employment programs, and operates a small-business incubator. It has been one of the success stories of the introduction of enterprise centres into Queensland in the early 1990s but it has not always been easy. The program of recurrent funding for enterprise centres announced by Minister Emerson during the election campaign will ensure that CBEC is able to expand its services to benefit the local business community.

            </a>
            , involvement which intensified in 1998 when I took on a senior role in the organisation. The festival is among the very best anywhere in the world, achieving all of its original goals and much more. I commend all members to visit it. From small beginnings in 1987 at its original location in Maleny to the internationally acclaimed event it is today, the festival stands as a testament to the leadership of Bill Hauritz, Amanda Jackes and Des Ritchie. It has been a privilege to work with them and the many hundreds of volunteers who make the festival possible. I will continue to watch it grow and will assist where I can.

            My third passion has been for sport and in particular the sport of softball, in which my daughters excelled, representing Queensland at age level. Since 2002 I have administered a junior players development organisation, Sunstate Wanderers, which we formed to provide young women athletes with extra tournament opportunities in

            Women’s team sport is easily equal as a spectacle to male team sport. I vividly recall sitting amongst a crowd of 10,000 watching softball during the

             Sydney Olympics

            . Many were, like me, fans of the sport. Others were there because of the occasion—because it was, after all, the Olympics. But each and every one of them was enthralled by the quality of the contests shown. We already recognise and give support to individual women athletes. Who did not have a tear in their eye watching

We know the names of women golfers, tennis players, track and field athletes, swimmers, cyclists and tri-athletes whose successes, near misses and even failures are deemed newsworthy and who by comparison to their team sport sisters are well paid but still lag way behind their male counterparts. It is time that changed and I hope I am able to help bring about that change through whatever influence I now have as a member of this parliament.

           <p>
            Census data electorate rankings released last year did not flatter Longman. We rated poorly by comparison on virtually every measure. In particular, I am concerned by the extremely low level of postsecondary education qualifications of those in the electorate aged over 15 years. This is at a time when our country is in the grip of a debilitating skills shortage. I intend to make it a priority of my time in parliament to work with all of the stakeholders to overcome this measure of disadvantage. Left unchecked, our community’s future will indeed be bleak, with our young people in particular affected. Trade training in high schools will be a great start and, as a result of the election commitments of the Rudd government, will soon be a fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            While universities also cater for mature age students, it is the predicament of our school leavers that is bordering on tragedy. A young person living in my area is confronted by a number of impediments in seeking a university education. Because their parents have not undertaken postsecondary studies, many young people grow up in households where there is no expectation that they will pursue university studies. Our location relative to Brisbane, where major campuses with extensive course offerings are located, means that students are generally unable to obtain living-away-from-home payments on their youth allowance. Access to most of those campuses is difficult, expensive and very time consuming for those reliant on public transport and not much better for those lucky enough to have their own vehicle. As a consequence, far too many of our young people simply decline university opportunities or leave home, as my daughters did, in order to make university attendance possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            The time has come now to give serious consideration to the need for a comprehensive university campus for our area. The existing small campus of the

            of Technology at Caboolture is great for those seeking qualifications for a career in nursing, primary school teaching or two strands of business, because they can complete their studies locally.

           <p>
            The people of Longman are served by two public and three private hospitals. The sites of the public hospitals at Caboolture and Redcliffe are very nearly at the stage where little more can be added by way of new buildings. In the foreseeable future, population growth will certainly outstrip the capacity of those hospitals to expand to meet the healthcare needs of our community. This is particularly so given that residential development is occurring in areas increasingly more distant from those hospitals. In my view it would be a wise precaution to begin now the work of identifying potential sites for a new hospital to serve our community in the future.

             Mr Speaker, may I start by congratulating you on your election to the esteemed position you hold. I would ask you to convey my congratulations to the Deputy Speaker,

              Bruce Scott
             </a>
             . It is indeed an honour and a privilege to stand here in parliament and once again represent my electorate of Paterson in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             . This is the fourth time I have stood here on the dawn of a new parliament and, as such, I appreciate and understand the challenges that lie ahead. I embrace the challenge willingly, as my affection for my electorate remains unchanged and I have, if at all possible, an increased desire to serve my constituents, and serve them well I will.
            </p>
            <p>
             I came into politics on the urging of a friend, who had derided me for merely complaining about the state of the country and the uncertainty of the future of my then young children, challenging me to take up the gauntlet and make a difference. When I first came to parliament as a member of the Howard government in 1996, Labor had left the country with unemployment levels over eight per cent, over one million Australians unemployed and $96 billion in government debt. I was confronted with the reality of young Australians in my electorate without direction, without hope and feeling deserted. In 1996, in my maiden speech, I said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             ... at the end of the day if I can be remembered for one contribution to this House I would want it to be that I was part of the team that helped turn the ship around; to steer a new course towards the nation’s salvation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the prime ministership of John Howard I believe that that objective has been achieved. Today, we now stand in opposition, and reluctantly hand over to Labor a renewed nation compared to 1996. Through the strong financial stewardship of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
              Peter Costello
             </a>
             , the coalition has paid off Labor’s $96 billion debt while at the same time cutting taxes. We have handed Labor balanced books, no debt, $28 billion in assets and a history of 10 out of 11 budget surpluses.
            </p>
            <p>
             During the Hawke-Keating Labor government era, we endured an average inflation rate of 5.2 per cent, while under the coalition it averaged 2.5 per cent. During the Hawke-Keating Labor government period, the maximum standard variable home loan rate rose to 17 per cent, while under the coalition it dropped to 6.05 per cent. The recent slight increases in interest rates under the Howard government were a direct result of the success of the economy over the past 11 years, not its failure. They were caused by giving excessive tax revenues back to the taxpayers who in turn elected to spend rather than save, fuelling an increase in demand and therefore putting upward pressure on interest rates. It is Peter Costello not
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
              Paul Keating
             </a>
             who has proven to be the world’s greatest treasurer.
            </p>
            <p>
             The coalition has left the new government with unemployment at the lowest level since 1974. More young Australians are taking up apprenticeships than ever before. That has come about not only because of the demand for skills but also because the coalition removed Labor’s long-held stigma towards being a tradie—a highly skilled person without a university degree. Full employment requires a broad range of skills to satisfy the market’s demands. However, high levels of skill take time to instil into those hungry for training. The mould has been set for the future. Let us hope that Labor does not break it again.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I truly believe that I have assisted the coalition to achieve my initial objective of helping turn the country around, but I believe there is still more to be done. With an economic crisis evolving in various parts of the world, let me say that managing a trillion-dollar economy is not a game. We need to keep vigilant. In unsteady and inexperienced hands, with outside interference from the unions, all that we have achieved as a nation could be in jeopardy. This great nation could be set back 20 years in terms of both the economy and employment. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Each of the state Labor governments is rapidly increasing debt. They have a proven inability to manage the public purse and have squandered the taxpayers’ money, spending well beyond their means, without increasing services vital to the community. For example, in New South Wales the state Labor government is selling off its electricity retail arm to cover debts. What next?
            </p>
            <p>
             I have retained the same passion I first came into politics with—the passion to make a difference. It is this passion which will see me continue to stand up for my community, to ensure the issues the community think are important are heard and that their needs are addressed. Election promises on both sides of politics were made during the campaign, and the importance of each is that they were promises on issues that are important to the very heart of the people of Paterson. I will be holding the Labor government to account to deliver on the promises they made during the election. Furthermore, I will be urging the government to fund the promises the coalition made, as my community not only needs but deserves these projects. As always, I will fight for my electorate of Paterson.

             s remains one of the most fundamental needs for all Australians and so, too, for those in my electorate of Paterson. I was proud to be involved in helping secure initial and ongoing funding for the successful GP after-hours access clinics in the area. Labor has promised $5 million in funding to establish GP superclinics in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens" rel="nofollow">

             . It is well documented that we have doctor shortages in our area, and I find it hard to fathom how the government believes that these superclinics will attract young graduates to the area when they have failed to be lured to our beautiful area so far. With such a large portion of the

             . But, again, I question where the GPs and other medical professionals will come from to staff these centres.

             Much was made in the local media of the need for a positron emission topography, or PET, scanner Medicare licence at the Mater hospital. PET is an emerging technology that uses radiation to project images to assess the development of diseases that may not be detectable by other imaging. While PET is not a treatment, it is a vital tool for doctors to use to help understand the location or stage of a disease, whether the cancer is still active after treatment or whether or not surgery is likely to be useful. The Mater is the major oncology hospital for the Newcastle and Hunter region and, even though the hospital is not in my electorate, I was called on to secure the funding because the Labor member for Newcastle had failed to adequately represent her community. I fought and lobbied for the funding from the coalition government and secured $2 million as a priority, which was signed off prior to the election. During the election, Labor promised $1.5 million in funding for the PET scanner for the Mater. Does this mean that the Mater funding will be cut back? For the sake of those who need this service, I sincerely hope not.
            </p>
            <p>
             Labor also committed to fund the Nabiac and district pool committee to the amount of $135,000; the Smiths Lakes sports field to the amount of $200,000; the extensions to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bay" rel="nofollow">

             . They committed to provide $15,000 to repair the Mallabula Panthers clubhouse, which was damaged by vandals setting fire to it. I think that they left at least one zero off the end of the reconstruction costs, as it will cost a lot more than $15,000. Make no bones about it: I will be holding the government to account to deliver on these promises. The coalition made election commitments after taking into account the needs of the community and I will put the case to the new government for funding, as these too are important community projects.

             Roads are undeniably one of the issues most frequently talked about by people in my electorate. We all need them; we all travel on them. Most importantly, they need to be safe. The Prime Minister,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
              Kevin Rudd
             </a>
             , said repeatedly before the election that he would end the blame game between the state and federal governments and that the buck stops with him. Well, Prime Minister, you can start in my electorate with roads and community safety. Funding for roadwork is a fundamental mainstay that all levels of government must supply. The councils and the community have told me they want the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingal_Bay" rel="nofollow">
              Fingal Bay

             link road built. The coalition promised $5 million to add to the $2 million that

              Port Stephens Council
             </a>
             has, and there is an expectation that the New South Wales government will contribute $2 million to the works. This 4.2 kilometre section of road will connect Government Road at

             to the corner of Gan Gan Road and Nelson Bay Road. It will provide a main thoroughfare to the Nelson Bay CBD, significantly reducing traffic in Nelson Bay and travel time to Fingal and Shoal bays.

              Bucketts Way

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrington_Tops" rel="nofollow">

              Pacific Highway
             </a>
             . The coalition provided over $24 million for road upgrades to the Bucketts Way during the past five years. The next phase is for passing lanes to be established on this 158 kilometre stretch of road. A re-elected coalition government would have committed $12 million to introduce passing lanes on the Bucketts Way, which are so desperately needed to improve safety.
            </p>

             Since 1996, the coalition has provided

             Council with over $9 million in funding to improve The Lakes Way, a road that stretches from Bulahdelah in the south to Forster in the north. Further upgrading work is needed and the coalition promised a further $3 million to upgrade two sections of The Lakes Way: $2.5 million was for the upgrade of 2.5 kilometres of The Lakes Way southbound on Tahiti Avenue and $500,000 was to be allocated to improve the intersection of The Lakes Way and Green Point Drive. These projects are not wants; they are desperate community needs. I urge the government to accede to the people’s needs on this issue and provide the funding. Excuses like ‘it’s a state issue’ or ‘it’s a local government issue’ do not cut it anymore. Remember, Prime Minister: you said that this is the end of the blame game and that the buck stops with you.

             Crime, and its effects, is the overriding fear for all Australians. I regularly receive letters from my constituents, pensioners too scared to venture out of their homes at night. They are scared and feel they cannot walk down the streets of towns they have lived in for dozens of years, sleepy towns they have raised their families in. I, too, am sick and tired of the hoons and vandals roaming seemingly unchecked in our streets, wantonly creating havoc, senselessly destroying property and committing crime. The community demands more police and greater security. The men and women in blue of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales Police Force
             </a>
             are some of the best in the world, but they are drastically underresourced in my area. The number of them on the streets is simply not enough to make people feel safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             The coalition government promised, if re-elected, to help make communities feel safer by providing funding for closed-circuit television cameras. These cameras have been shown to reduce the incidence of senseless vandalism and can result in the prosecution of the perpetrators. The coalition had committed $400,000 to the project, which would involve cooperation between all three levels of government and the community to deliver

             in known hot spots. Cameras were to be installed in Forster, Tuncurry, Tilligerry,

              Raymond Terrace
             </a>
             , Dungog and Gloucester. That being said, nothing impacts on crime more than a police presence amongst the community. I know that the problem will be fixed, because Prime Minister Rudd said that the buck stops with him and that he would end the blame game. Well, we will wait and see.

             Tourism is a major employer and economic driver in the electorate of Paterson. The beautiful areas of Forster and Tuncurry attract an increasing number of tourists each year, who flock to be a part of these relaxed coastal towns.

             </a>
             is to be commended on its approach to beautifying and increasing accessibility to the waterways. The coalition government pledged, if re-elected, to commit $1 million for works to extend the foreshore boardwalk and other improvements on the Forster side of the lake, fronting Little Street. I strongly urge the government to continue with this work because of the economic and environmental benefits.

             Whether it is protecting whales and dolphins off my electorate’s coastline, the restoration or protection of sensitive habitat or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the care of our environment is of vital concern to all in our community. Over the past 18 months, I have been working with Gerry McGowan,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             of CBD Energy, a Sydney based company that is a pioneer in renewable energies and the storage of energy. CBD proposed the construction of a 30 megawatt renewable energy farm utilising state-of-the-art, thin-film photovoltaic panels in the Hunter Water buffer-zone land around the Grahamstown Dam.
            </p>
            <p>
             The additional benefit to our region is that thin-film solar panels are to be manufactured in a new facility to be established in the Hunter. This project will create 100 jobs over the next four years and generate $400 million in annual export income. This is a major step forward for renewable technology development in the Hunter and works hand in hand with clean coal technologies such as those being developed by Corky’s Carbon Technology and the wind power generation farms at Vacy and that proposed for Scone. I would strongly urge the government to support the $20 million commitment made by the coalition government for this CBD Energy project as the benefits to the environment, the benefit of the local jobs created in the community and the additional $400 million bottom-line trade figures for our nation are only good news.

The success of this campaign owed itself to a magnificent team effort all the way from my dedicated staff, the campaign team and the over 700 local supporters and volunteers who worked tirelessly on 24 November for a return of the Howard government and retention of the seat of Paterson.

The sacrifices made by family members of politicians can never be understated. I acknowledge the outstanding job Cynthia has done in raising our family almost single-handedly; all this whilst holding an important community leadership role and recently finalising a masters degree in special education. I know that her sacrifice has enabled me to represent the people of Paterson unfettered and make what I believe to be a significant contribution in building a better Australia for all families.

             Finally, I must say that, despite being in opposition, I am more determined than ever to represent the people of Paterson, to put forward their concerns and achieve outcomes for our community. I relish the challenge ahead and I thank the people of Paterson for the honour and privilege they have bestowed upon me to again be their representative in this House.
