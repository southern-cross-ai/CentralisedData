          I indicate at the outset that the coalition supports the amendments. I thank the minister at the table, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform, for facilitating a briefing for me and Senator Fifield on the detail of the amendments. It was held this week. It gave us the opportunity to look at the detail of those amendments. They are, for all intents and purposes, sensible amendments which should be made, and this House should be supporting them. That is why we will support them today.
         </p>
         <p>
          We envisage that there may be further amendments as a result of further inquiries into the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
           NDIS
          </a>
          , and that is to be expected because this is very much a work in progress. The NDIS will not be fulfilled in the way that everybody aspires to for many years. That is going to take a considerable amount of work and cooperation not only here at the Commonwealth level but between the Commonwealth and the states and territories over what may be the next two or three terms of this parliament. Such a monumental change as this one, I believe, signals something about the approach of all us in this place to an issue whose time has come, in terms of ensuring that there is the best treatment that we can possibly put in place and afford for people who have disabilities, particularly those with profound disabilities, in Australia.

          </p>
          <p class="italic">

           The Agency may provide funding for the establishment and ongoing operation of a national complaints handling mechanism that would have the purpose of resolving complaints made in relation to services and support provided for under this Act.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will not take up much of the parliament's time explaining my amendments because, frankly, I think they are self-explanatory and also because I am as keen as anyone in this place to see the National Disability Insurance Scheme pass through the parliament as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first amendment would ensure that the right to access advocacy services is a fundamental principle of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           —and so it should be, I suggest, because, even with the very best of intentions and the very best disability support arrangements, there will continue to be a pressing need for some people with a disability to be able to access independent disability advocacy support services that promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights enabling full community participation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The second amendment addresses the concern in the disability sector that some form of guarantee needs to be embedded in the NDIS that applicants for support, and participants, will be able to access advocacy support services. Yes, there are arrangements currently in place which provide for advocacy services nationwide. But the current Commonwealth block-funding arrangement is not guaranteed and is limited, providing currently only some $16 million annually, spread across all of the states and territories. This simple amendment will go some way at least to providing that certainty by giving the National Disability Insurance Agency the power to fund advocates should the need arise and, in doing so, also provide for another avenue of funding for any additional advocacy services that might be required, especially in the NDIS establishment years.
          </p>
          <p>
           I add that I acknowledge that there is a widespread belief in the disability sector that advocacy services must be independent of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
            NDIA
           </a>
           . This makes sense to me and I agree with it because advocates should not be put in situations where they are acting against their employer. For that reason, the amendment makes explicit that any funding for advocacy that the NDIA might provide is to be paid to other government organisations, the result being that advocates ultimately funded by the NDIA will not be acting simultaneously for the NDIA and an applicant or participant in the NDIS. They will be at arm's length from government, which is exactly the situation now.
          </p>
          <p>
           The final amendment simply gives the NDIA the authority to establish a national complaints-handling arrangement, again if the need arises. This is important because currently the complaints arrangements in the states and territories are limited to those jurisdictions, which is obviously incompatible with a federally funded national disability support system. Moreover, I am advised that what does exist currently is inconsistent and inadequate in some jurisdictions, which reflects the very need for a National Disability Insurance Scheme aimed at bringing equity and certainty to the disability sector.
          </p>
          <p>
           In developing these amendments I have relied on the advice of a number of people, in particular the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
            Chief Executive Officer
           </a>
           of the Disability Advocacy Network Australia, Andrea Simmons; as well the President of Advocacy Tasmania, Alderman David Pearce; and the Chief Executive Officer of Advocacy Tasmania, Ken Hardaker. To them and to the many others who informed my consideration of the NDIS, once again I say thank you. In closing, I say thank you to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform for the tireless work she has done on delivering what history will record as one of the most important nation-changing reforms of this or any parliament.

           <p>
            I thank the member for Denison for his concern for the role of advocates. As he knows, we too understand the very important role that advocates play, as they work very, very hard to support the needs of people with disability.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the member for Denison has acknowledged, the bill sets out a very clear function for the agency—to facilitate care and support for people with disability. If the agency provided funding to advocates as the member for Denison's amendment would effect, the agency would be administering funding to advocates with whom they may strongly disagree. We are concerned that this could lead to a conflict, and, as I previously indicated to the member for Denison, it is my strong view that funding for independent advocacy should remain separate from the National Disability Insurance Agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course there is funding that the government provides. That is in the budget—it is provided in the forward estimates—and I think it is very critical to the ongoing needs of people with disability. I think that this money should continue to be provided by the government but not through the statutory agency that we are establishing today. The independence of advocacy is absolutely critical and must be maintained, including in funding arrangements. This was the view put by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Productivity Commission
            </a>
            . It is also the view that has been put by many advocacy organisations, both to me and to the Senate inquiry. They do not want to see advocacy managed by the agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is also particularly relevant in the broader context of these amendments is that the amendment would have the effect of requiring the agency to fund advocacy services, and this is not to be core business for the agency. So, although I understand and respect the intention of the amendments being moved by the member for Denison, we do not share his view about the best way to achieve it. He understands my view. So we will not be supporting the amendments.

              The Greens
             </a>
             have been strong supporters for a very long time of the principle of advocacy, and especially the principle of advocacy for people who are living with a disability.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
              The Senate
             </a>
             inquiry report had a very active participant in our Senator Rachel Siewert, who has been heavily involved for some time in the question of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             and making sure that, when we ultimately have a scheme, it does enshrine in a systematic and well-thought-out way the principles of advocacy and also that advocacy continues to be adequately funded. As any perusal of that Senate report will demonstrate, especially given that there is a whole chapter devoted in the Senate report to the question of advocacy, this is something that is far from a new issue and is something that requires some careful thought to ensure that we get it right.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the things that come through crystal clear from the evidence received by the Senate inquiry is that the weight of evidence from people living with a disability and from the services that represent them was that, although they wanted advocacy, they did not want funding to come from the NDIS. There are a couple of reasons for that. The first is to ensure that there is more money available for the NDIS rather than more money being taken out of it. The second and important issue is the principle of independence. Even though, if this amendment were successful, we might have an agency giving money to someone who is at arm's length, they are still in control of whether they can turn the tap on or off. And that does potentially compromise the advocacy ability of the agency that may receive the funding under this amendment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The question of a complaints body and the ability to address issues about decisions that are made under the NDIS is also a critical one. It is important that it is raised and that it is dealt with. But, again, this is something that has been the subject of extensive evidence and requires a well-thought-out response. When this legislation comes to the Senate, the Greens will be pursuing these questions of advocacy and also a complaints mechanism through the form of amendments, because it is something that we have been concerned about for some time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I respect the spirit in which the member for Denison is moving these amendments, but unfortunately it cuts across the weight of what the Senate inquiry has been told the majority of people who are living with a disability, and the services that represent them, actually want out of this scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, the legislation can be improved—and I commend the member for Denison for making an attempt to do that—but this is not the right way to go about it. It would not have the support of the sector, which I think is very important. At the end of the day, principles of advocacy, at both an individual level and a systemic level, need to be enshrined and well funded, but independence must be first and foremost. In a situation where most of the people fronting the Senate inquiry said, 'For that reason, we do not want advocacy to be funded through the agency,' that is something that should be respected.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Greens look forward to continuing our commitment to advocacy, including for people living with a disability, and pursuing appropriate amendments in the Senate.

              At the outset, I thank the member for Denison for discussing his amendments with me and with Senator Fifield. As, I understand, has been indicated to him, we do have some sympathy for what the member for Denison is seeking to do. We understand that advocacy is important for people with disabilities. If there were no advocacy, I suspect this bill would not be in the process of being debated in this parliament. Advocacy is very important in relation to people with disabilities. However, on balance, we tend to adopt the reasons the minister has set out in relation to the separation of the funding. In relation to the suggestion about a complaints mechanism, we again have sympathy for that; it is something we believe the government should give some further consideration to. I know these matters are going to the Senate. But, on balance, at this stage we will not be supporting the amendments which the member for Denison has put before the House.

              I do not want to delay the consideration by the House for a long period of time, but this is the proposal which has been raised by the opposition for the appointment of a joint select committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This arises from what is accepted universally in this chamber and the other place and outside this parliament—that this is the beginning of a process. We are here today at the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end. It is going to take many years and a number of parliaments for the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
               NDIS
              </a>
              to be put in place. We believe, therefore, that it is entirely appropriate that this parliament, not just the executive of the day—and that might change from time to time between now and when we see the fruition of the NDIS—should continue to have an oversight role in relation to the rolling out of the NDIS.
             </p>
             <p>
              The proposal is that there be a joint select committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This is a proposal that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition. We believe that, at a time when the Independents, for example, have been calling for greater parliamentary involvement in the democracy represented by this parliament, this could be the epitome of providing that greater representation. I look forward to the contributions and the votes of my honourable colleagues to my left. Without rehearsing the argument any further, we believe this is sensible as a proposal. It means that whoever is in government over the course of rolling out the NDIS will be subject to some parliamentary scrutiny, and that can only be a good thing.

              <p>
               I thank the member for Menzies. As the member for Menzies knows, and I think every single member of the House is aware, the legislation that we are voting on today sets out a comprehensive framework for the governance of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Most importantly, I think, in the legislation before us, the scheme will be delivered by an independent national organisation. These robust governance arrangements have been thought about very carefully. They include not only robust internal governance arrangements but comprehensive government oversight, and not just by the Commonwealth.
              </p>
              <p>
               As the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                Productivity Commission
               </a>
               recommended, the agency is established under the Commonwealth Authorities and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act" rel="nofollow">
                Companies Act
               </a>
               , ensuring that it is an independent agency with reporting responsibilities to the parliament. The National Disability Insurance Scheme board, which is responsible for the operation of the agency, will report quarterly to the ministerial council, which is made up of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers. The legislation requires a two-year review of the operation of the scheme to be tabled in this parliament.
              </p>
              <p>
               The amendments that I have moved today and that have been agreed to by the House strengthen actuarial oversight of the scheme and also impose reporting obligations on both the scheme and the reviewing actuary. The amendments also appoint the Australian Government Actuary as the reviewing actuary for the first three years of operation. As I said, these are comprehensive and very robust governance arrangements. I reiterate that they reflect the strong view of the Productivity Commission about the need for independence of the agency. Nevertheless, they ensure regular ministerial and parliamentary oversight of the scheme, particularly expenditure of public funds both state and federal. This is of course as it should be. This is a very significant enterprise we are putting through this House today. We want to make sure the agency we are establishing today can operate as an independent, accountable and transparent organisation in the interests of people with disability and their families and carers. For these reasons, the government will not be supporting the opposition's amendment.
