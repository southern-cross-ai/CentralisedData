       <p>
        Yesterday was a really important day in our community. It was the 20th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Daisy Hill
        </a>
        Koala Centre. Anyone who has interacted with the koala centre at Daisy Hill would know that it plays a crucial role in koala preservation, as well as in the broader context of the Daisy Hill forest and the conservation parks that surround it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say this as someone who grew up on the fringe of that forest and who lives on the fringe of that forest now: I have a deep appreciation for all the staff and volunteers, as well as all of the clubs that use the forest, of the Daisy Hill Koala Centre, which celebrated its anniversary. With the anniversary celebrations yesterday, the place was full of people. With the celebration came an important announcement from Premier Palaszczuk and also the Minister for Environment and Heritage Protection,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Miles" rel="nofollow">
         Steven Miles
        </a>
        . They were accompanied by the member for Capalaba,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Brown" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and also my great friend the member for Springwood, my local member, Mick de Brenni. The announcement was that the koala will now be listed as vulnerable in Queensland, as it is federally, which is an important announcement. Previously it was limited to the south-east corner of the state, and now it will be state wide. So I pay tribute to the Premier, the minister and my local member for that announcement yesterday. Mick de Brenni shares my deep appreciate for the forest. He is a regular user of the forest and he understands. The decision will be welcomed not only by koala lovers and conservationists but by everyone in my community who values the forest and the work that goes on there to make our community such a livable place.
