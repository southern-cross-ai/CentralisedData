       <p>
        I would like to follow on from the comments by the member for Deakin and bring to the attention of the House the disgraceful behaviour of our state Labor government in Victoria and their complete neglect of the people of Goldstein.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is that in July of this year the state Labor government announced a plan to build a 13-storey development over Ormond train station after its recent development. As a consequence, there has been no consultation or engagement with the community. Small businesses were given two weeks to deal with the circumstances and the damage that has been done to their business. Small traders have been put out of business because of Labor's indifference and arrogance towards people in the great electorate of Goldstein. Worse than that, Labor now have a plan where a high-rise redevelopment is being proposed in a suburban area which has no shop frontage and is not appropriate for the context.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pro-development, and I recognise the importance of making sure that we have housing affordability for everybody, but even the Greens local mayor says it is a bad idea. That is how bad it is. Labor are constantly demonstrating in Victoria that they are not interested in people's interest, they are not interested in protecting communities and they are only interested in delivering for their Labor union mates.
