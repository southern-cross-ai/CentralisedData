       <p>
        I have just given some brief remarks, in my second reading contribution, about the importance of instigating in the federal parliament a law that would include and ensure that we have a $1,000 political donations disclosure threshold. As I said in my second reading contribution, I think it would be extremely important and it would meet community expectations if we were in fact fair dinkum about political donations transparency in the federal parliament, and if we joined with many of our state governments and other jurisdictions around the world in ensuring we truly understand how often donations come through, where donations come through and the amount of donations that come through to our federal parliament, through donations to major parties and, indeed, to Independents as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have moved a private member's bill in this House in regard to these amendments before. The member for Mayo has done the same. There is strong community support to have greater transparency in political donations, and great community support to see the donations threshold lowered from $14,500 to $1,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thoughts on this are very clear. They are contrary, certainly, to what some other members on the other side might have to say about this, but I have great confidence these are amendments that would be supported by the people, and I urge those in this House to support these amendments today.

          As I pointed out to the minister in one of my meetings with him, it is common practice for candidates from major parties to lodge individual

          returns that state they receive no money whatsoever during an election, and quite obviously this is untrue.

         <p>
          This is a problem because political donations come straight into party headquarters and a combined return is put forward. I think that what's really happening here is that there is a clear exploitation of a loophole to ensure that the public is left in the dark about how much money is actually spent in each electorate, and I think that's a problem. The public have that information about Independent candidates. They know exactly how much was raised and how much was spent. What this amendment seeks to do is improve transparency in our electoral act and to ensure that, for every candidate—every person who runs for election—when they put their AEC return in, it is absolutely clear how much money has been spent, by electorate.
