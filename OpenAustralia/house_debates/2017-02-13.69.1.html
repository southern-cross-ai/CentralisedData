        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, because today he said of the WA
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation

        preference deal:

        This is a disappointing move. I hope the architects of it clearly understand the ramifications of the decision â€¦
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the federal Minister for Finance was closely involved in the negotiations, has the finance minister ever conducted legislation negotiations in the Senate with One Nation on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister or any other National Party ministers? Is the Deputy Prime Minister happy to have the Minister for Finance negotiating with One Nation on his behalf?

         The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I have ruled one question out of order on the subject matter. I have allowed another two in. That question is in the category of the first question asked. It is out of order. I will hear from the Manager of Opposition Business.

              I thank the member for Hunter for his apt question about agriculture. I am always waiting for a question on agriculture or water from the member for Hunter. I think what would be better would be to get a question on energy security, since he is the member for Hunter and, last time I went through there, there was actually a power station, or a couple, that he might want to keep open, just like the member for Shortland might want to keep their power stations open. But, of course, they do not believe in keeping their power stations open. They believe in anything but the questions that are actually pertinent either to their portfolio or to the area where they live.
             </p>
             <p>
              To the area of the effects of preference deals and how they affect legislation, that is a very pertinent question for the member for Herbert, who got in on

              preferences, and the member for Longman, who got in on One Nation preferences, and the member for Dobell, who got in on One Nation preferences. So we have rather a confusion of how to deal with things when the Labor Partyâ€”

                  I paid heed to the point of order, and it was kind of irrelevant: it started badly, faded away a bit in the middle and the less said about the end of it the better. What we actually see with the Labor Party is that they will completely avoid the issue that is pertinent to how you actually get working men and women back into work. You have a choice: you can either have cheap labour or cheap power. They do not believe in cheap power, they do not believe in actually looking after the working men and women.

                  his whole political agenda within the Labor Party has now been determined by Greens preferences. As was the member for Hunter, who no doubt got Greens preferences. He is very proud of those Greens preferences. Because I know, to his bootstraps, he believes in the Greens agenda. Of course, I know one personâ€”that is, the member for Grayndlerâ€”who almost is a Greens member! He just sits thereâ€”he has to get
