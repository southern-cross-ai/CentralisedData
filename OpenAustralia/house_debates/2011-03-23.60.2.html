         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the question of attending the rally outside
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         today, I am not aware that I was invited. But, as I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition did not lack for red-headed company at that rally. He had a red-headed friend out at that rally, so I am sure he would not have missed me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me turn to the substantive question that he has asked me about talking to the Australian people and campaigning for climate change action. The Leader of the Opposition seems to have forgotten that he sat in the Howard cabinet for years—a truly remarkable feat—and that he used to claim the Prime Minister as his political mentor. He sat in that cabinet day after day making decisions for the Howard government. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that amongst the decisions the Howard government made was their decision to go to the 2007 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme. The Labor Party also went to the 2007 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme and we went to the 2010 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme.

           We understand that the Leader of the Opposition wants to continue his scare campaigns. He only knows one thing, which is to scare people, to try to make them afraid, and to deny the future. He has no positive policies and plans. What is remarkable is not his hollowness, because that is well-known; what is remarkable is that he would march away from the legacy of the Howard government at such a speed—march away from Prime Minister Howard’s commitments to an emissions trading scheme and march away from the Liberal Party philosophy about the power of the markets.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Leader of the Opposition may be stuck in this denial and in his inability to make up a policy for the nation’s future, but we are not. We will get on with the job of leading this nation to a clean energy future. If you care about the jobs of the future, you want to price carbon. If you care about the environment, you want to price carbon. That is precisely what we will do.

                 I thank the member for Petrie for her wonderfully perceptive question, because her question actually captures the major issue before this parliament today. I know the member for Petrie is someone who is in touch with her community and is out there having the real discussions with her community about this nation’s future, including the need to tackle climate change and to price carbon. As she does that, I know that she says to people in her community, in the wonderful state of Queensland, that we are a nation blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy.

                  <p>
                   Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was pointing to the fact that our nation is blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy—wind, geothermal and solar. We have abundant sources. If we look at solar energy, we have more solar radiation per square metre than any other continent in the world. In fact, we could power our country 500 times over if we were able to capture all of the solar energy in places where we could reasonably install solar panels. And if we used just one per cent of our estimated geothermal energy, we could supply roughly 25,000 times our energy consumption. These are great possibilities for our nation and great possibilities for its future. But, in order to realise those great possibilities, we need to get on with the job of pricing carbon.

                         a national debate about pricing carbon and ensuring we do the right thing by our environment. I would like to remind people of some moments in that national debate. I have here the Liberal Party climate change policy from 1990. It has got
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Peacock" rel="nofollow">
                          Andrew Peacock
                         </a>
                         on it, as of course it would, as he was the leader at the time. We all know that a souffle does not rise twice, but Mr Peacock did want to do something about rising greenhouse gases. And here we have his policy: a target to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 20 per cent by the year 2000—a more progressive man in 1990 than the Leader of the Opposition is today. When you look at the election policy, you see that he was arguing for a tax review to promote sound environmental practices in industry and he said that he would never resile from a willingness to act in the genuine national interest wherever that is required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The history of Liberal engagement with this question goes on. Here is the environment policy from the days of
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hewson" rel="nofollow">
                          John Hewson
                         </a>
                         and Fightback. As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition wrote Fightback. Maybe he wrote this as well: ‘a better environment and jobs’—their policy. This says: ‘Where possible, the coalition will look for market solutions to environmental problems. We will use market forces and realistic pricing mechanisms as the primary means of regulation.’ That is something the Liberal Party no longer believes in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Then, from the 2007 election, we have all of these documents, with Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello committing the Liberal Party to action on climate change and an emissions trading scheme. Those were the days when the Liberal Party bothered to deal with facts. Now they have succumbed to this low point under the Leader of the Opposition, where all they deal in is fear. Does the Leader of the Opposition remember those days?

                           I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and let me advise him: I make my own decisions. I make my own decisions based on my convictions. When I work through policies for the government, I rely on facts. So how have I formed my view about climate change? Let me be very clear. I looked to the scientific community for what the scientific consensus was. I dealt with facts, not fear. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is in a flirtation with climate change denial. I have looked at the facts and at the science. I formed the view that we need to act. I have accepted economic advice from around the world—the same economic advice the member for Flinders accepted when he wrote his thesis and the same advice former Prime Minister Howard accepted when he released these documents and when the current Leader of the Opposition was in his cabinet. That advice was that the best way of acting on carbon pollution was to harness the power of the market and to have an emissions trading scheme.

                          <p>
                           I remind the House that in 2007 Prime Minister Howard actually went to the election promising ‘the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world’. Post the 2010 election, we work in the parliament the Australian people voted for. In this parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, we work with others to secure reforms in the national interest. I formed the view, working with the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and understanding the views of members who are represented on that committee, including the

                           , Mr Windsor and Mr Oakshott, that the best way of securing reform in this parliament, the way forward, was to bring a carbon pricing mechanism to the parliament, and I announced that carbon pricing mechanism. I had a choice between acting and not acting. I had a choice between acting in the national interest and failing to do so. I had a choice between accepting the science and engaging in denial. I had a choice between accepting quality economic advice and rejecting that advice. On every occasion, I made a choice to act—to accept the science, to accept the economic advice, and to work with this parliament to bring carbon pricing to this parliament.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Unfortunately, at every point the Leader of the Opposition has made a different choice: to flirt with climate change denial, to reject economic advice and the power of the markets, to turn his back on 20 years of Liberal engagement with reducing carbon pollution—most recently Prime Minister Howard’s promise to enact the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world. In making that choice, the Leader of the Opposition was guided every step of the way by his political interest. He thinks it is in his political interest to be out there raising fear and scaring the community.

                           say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on every judgment call he has needed to make in the nation’s interest on the question of climate change, he has called wrong. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition too that the Australian community will hold him to account for that.

In the light of the evasions that we have just heard from her, I ask the Prime Minister: does she honestly believe that she would be in the Lodge today if, six days before the last election, she had been straight with the Australian people and said upfront to them, ‘Yes, there will be a carbon tax under the government I lead’?

What I said to the Australian people before the last election is that climate change is real. I accept the science. It is caused by human activity. We need to act. The way to act is to introduce an emissions trading scheme, and we will get there. We will get to an emissions trading scheme, working with the parliament that the Australian people elected.

                                        I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that I understand his frustration, that he believes that he is (a) not getting the answer he is trying to elicit and (b) not being answered in the way he would wish. I have said to this House that, if members want to improve the exchange in questions and answers, the simplest way of doing that is to apply the same rules to both, which would remove the argument. I regret to say that we confront a decision that I have to make on whether the response be argument or the placing of facts before the chamber and whether it is directly relevant or not. Whilst I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition believes he has asked a specific question for which he wants a direct answer, as I have stated throughout the year, that is not the standing order.

                                           Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying: I said to the Australian people before the 2010 election that I believed climate change was real. I said to the Australian people before that election that climate change was induced by human activity. It is induced by carbon pollution and we need to act on carbon pollution. I said to the Australian people the best way of addressing carbon pollution was to price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. And we will get there.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Of course I campaigned for majority government. I work now in the parliament the Australian people voted for, and in this parliament we will price carbon through the carbon mechanism that I announced, despite the fear campaign of the Leader of the Opposition, despite the campaign of denial and fear that he is raising. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to debate political honesty in this place, then bring it on—

Bring it on; I am very happy to have it.

                                                My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why is putting a price on carbon an important economic reform for Australia’s future; and what is the government’s response to recent expressions of opinion on the economics of a carbon price?

                                                 I thank the member for Oxley for this very important question because putting a price on carbon is the right thing to do for Australia. It is not an easy thing to do. There are no soft options and of course there are no cost-free options, but it is the right thing to do not just for the future of our country but also for the future of our economy.

                                                <p>
                                                 There are diverse views in the community, and we welcome a full debate about global warming and what must be done about it. We welcome a frank debate, but that debate must be based on facts, not on fear. The behaviour that we have seen from the opposition, and particularly the opposition leader, today is that he is moving over to the fringe. He is moving over to the fear side of the argument and he does not want to confront the facts.

                                                 Yesterday he took offence in this House at being called a climate change denier. But out there today he was addressing a climate sceptics rally. Yesterday he was claiming he was somehow a believer in action on global warming but today he is out there addressing a rally of climate change sceptics.

                                                 I would like to quote from the website used by the group that was out the front of parliament today. Fair enough: they should be out expressing their opinions. I do not contest that for a moment. This is a debate about ideas. It should be a debate about ideas. It should be a debate about fact. But this is what the website that is used by those who were outside parliament today says—and everybody should listen very carefully:

How can he have any credibility in here when he says he believes in dealing with global warming and goes out and addresses a rally of people who do not believe in dealing with global warming? How can he have any crediblity at all? He comes into this House and says he is a believer in markets and then he puts forward some Russian-style scheme to deal with changes in the environment.

                                                  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question is out of order in that in contravention of standing order 100 it invites inferences, imputations and insults about the people who are in the rally today who are defenceless to defend themselves. Quite properly, the answer is in fact showing that the question is out of order in the first place, and indeed the member for Isaacs earlier in the chamber said across the chamber to me, ‘How could you associate with those people?’ The implications and the insults that are coming from that side of the House and the scare campaign means that the minister should be sat down.

Let me also advise the member that renewables account for 60 per cent of newly installed capacity in Europe and more than 50 per cent in the US. At the same time, let me inform the member that China surpassed the US as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy.

Let’s just have a think about what that means for the future of the global economy and the economy of our region. We have the giant economy of China investing at that rate in clean energy, more than the United States. What should that imply to the member for Indi if she really stopped and thought about it? It should imply that China is making those investments for a purpose. It is making those investments because it too wants to tackle climate change. It should imply to the member for Indi that there will be huge economic possibilities for our nation as China invests. If we research and develop and are at the forefront, the cutting edge of this technology, imagine the wealth that could be generated. If we are there as a clean energy nation ourselves, able to export technologies and knowledge to a giant like China, imagine the wealth.

Let me say to the member for Indi: our future as a nation will be made by being a cleaner energy economy. We cannot afford to be left behind as giants like China and the US and the countries of Europe change and move. We cannot afford to be left behind. Prime Minister Howard understood this; Treasurer Peter Costello understood this.

She was re-elected in this parliament in 2007 on the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. I say to the members of the Liberal Party who are truly ashamed of this fear campaign, who are truly ashamed of how low the Liberal Party has fallen under this Leader of the Opposition: it is time for them to assert themselves and say unambiguously that they believe in the climate change science—
