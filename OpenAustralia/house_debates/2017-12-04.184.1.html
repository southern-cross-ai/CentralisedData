I see my great mate the member for Fremantle here; I'm sure he will agree that we can't always spend as much time in those school as we would like to, because we have the privilege of serving in this place. So, in the remaining 60 seconds of my speech, I am going to try to give a shout out to all 50 of them, and here I goâ€”with apologies to

        That is all of them, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I tell you what: they all do such a good job. To all of the kids, all of the principals, the great teachers, the support staff, the ed support and all of the admin staff: you deserve a well-earned break, you do a marvellous job, and thank you very much.
