        It is with the greatest privilege that I rise today to bring to the attention of the House two magnificent constituents of Bonner who have over many years demonstrated extraordinary amounts of selfless sacrifice to help those in the community who are less fortunate than themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marjory Hayes has lived in the Wynnum district in my electorate of Bonner for 76 years. Over these many years she has been heavily involved in numerous community groups in the area and is fondly known by many as 'Granny' Hayes. Her time is spent volunteering for the local

         Salvation Army
        </a>
        jumble shop, at the Pleasantville Nursing Home in the staff canteen, with the Red Shield Appeal and with Legacy. Mrs Hayes has also had a longstanding association with the Mount Gravatt Show and has assisted in the Work for the Dole activity at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Mission Australia
        </a>
        . Furthermore, through her networking abilities and her numerous contacts and friends, Mrs Hayes has been able to assist young women in the bayside area with upskilling to help them re-enter the workforce. Every Christmas Mrs Hayes travels throughout the bayside area and visits the residents of pensioner units with a small gift. She is an outstanding member of the community, and those local to Wynnum are very blessed to have such a wonderful citizen in their area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this time to acknowledge the fantastic work of one of the local sergeants in my area, Sergeant Peter Farley, who has recently retired after 37 years of service to the community, with the last 17 years of service at the Bayside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        . During Sergeant Farley's time on the police force he formulated the first Queensland police service documented youth strategy, and his clear passion for helping the children in our community has been prevalent in the large proportion of time he has spent on developing programs at the Bayside PCYC to help keep youth of the area away from crime. As one of the true nice guys in the Bonner electorate, Sergeant Farley has dedicated his time to improving the Wynnum community, and I wish him all the very best in his retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonner is incredibly lucky to have upstanding citizens like Marjory Hayes and Peter Farley, and I am sure that everyone will agree with me when I say that volunteers and the police are the lifeblood of the community. They selflessly give so much of their time to better the lives of those less fortunate than themselves It is only fitting that I acknowledge two such examples in this chamber, and on behalf of the wider Bonner community, I give my heartfelt thanks. I know that these sentiments that I have expressed today are shared by all those that they assist.
