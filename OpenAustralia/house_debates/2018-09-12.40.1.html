         Western Australia
        </a>
        is home to some incredible talent, skill and innovation, and nowhere more so than in the electorate of Cowan. I want to talk today about two very impressive small businesses that operate within my electorate. The first one is Sunvertec, which is run by a father-and-son duo, Kevin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Davies" rel="nofollow">
         Alex Davies
        </a>
        . It's a high-technology company specialising in power conversion between isolated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC" rel="nofollow">
         DC
        </a>
        power sources and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        power. They've got years of experience, research and development and have produced a device called a direct drive inverter. These inverters are smaller and lighter and make installation quicker and easier. As a result of that, they can be manufactured through low-cost production techniques, enabling a general lowering of power costs to the end user. Sunvertec are currently working with power companies to discover additional controls over the digitally controlled storage inverter that can be used to enable increased penetration of distributed energy resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another amazing small business operating out of my electorate is Top
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV" rel="nofollow">
         EV
        </a>
        Innovations, which is run by Michael Fragomeni. I've had the privilege of meeting with Michael on several occasions and going out and having a look at his operation. He works in partnership both locally and globally with electric vehicles, power technologies, industrial processes and commercial applications, looking at advanced propulsion systems and clean energy engineering. Top
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV_Innovations" rel="nofollow">
         EV Innovations
        </a>
        are actually building a drag car that is completely solar powered. Michael is also looking at graphene nanotechnology and leading-edge developments in production and infrastructure and advanced coatings for ultrahigh-power handling and lossless electrical components. So there is some really innovative work that has been showcased in several media by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Engineers Australia
        </a>
        and Regional Development Australia et cetera.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what do these two amazing organisations in my electorate have in common? They're two exemplary small businesses at the cutting edge of renewable and sustainable energy solutions. Western Australia is set to triple its rooftop solar capacity by 2030, with more than 40 per cent of its energy mix to come from renewable energy. This is reported by Energy Networks Australia—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENA" rel="nofollow">
         ENA
        </a>
        —and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        . I quote the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of ENA,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bradley" rel="nofollow">
         John Bradley
        </a>
        , who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Western Australia is set to lead the edge-of-grid energy transformation in the coming decade and beyond as more customers continue to take up distributed energy resources like solar and batteries.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I wish all of the organisations in my electorate the best of luck.
