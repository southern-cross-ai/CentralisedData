        Regional Business Awards. The Glen is the only male-specific drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in our region, and it was recognised for their incredible community spirit and the extraordinary work that they do in giving people a second chance.

        , said the Central Coast community has been very supportive of the centre, with many businesses donating food during the COVID-19 pandemic and offering clients job opportunities to help them to rebuild their lives. Alex said the award has been a real boost to our clients and staff and they are all extremely proud. We are very proud of you as well.

        The federal government has also committed $9 million towards a new Glen centre for women, and construction is on track. A local company North Construction &amp; Building is working on the build, and I'm advised that The Glen will start advertising for jobs soon and expect to have staff on site from March next year. Executive director of the centre, Joe Coyte, has said that the build includes space for 20 beds, a multipurpose room, recreation spaces and a group room. Joe said he hopes the new building will be a home for many women, where they feel comfortable to rebuild their lives. Programs are being designed and will include a lot of activities that promote physical, cultural and artistic forms of healing. The whole community is excited for the facility to open, and I can't wait to see it myself. Congratulations to all at The Glen.
