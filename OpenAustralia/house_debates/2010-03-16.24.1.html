       <p>
        Does the minister agree with Mr Zadkovich that there are too many reports of waste and mismanagement of this program to ignore any longer? Minister, when will you take responsibility for this systemic failure?

The Australian people and his colleagues on the backbench, who are looking a bit cross-eyed at this point, will judge him on the weakness of that performance.

                   And they describe that work as ‘blah, blah, blah’. Well, these are reforms that matter to the Australian community, Australian kids and the future of this nation. With going, ‘blah, blah, blah,’ you have just shown the Australian people the contempt in which you hold them—parents, children, teachers and principals in this country. You could not show more how unfit you are for office if you tried.
