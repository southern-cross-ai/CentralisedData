        I seek to re-table Kath Madgwick's handwritten letter to parliament. During question time the government was tabling a plethora of documents. Kath Madgwick, I think, has earned the right to at least have her handwritten statement tabled. I spoke to her last night and have spoken to her at length. Talking about her son's suicide is very difficult, and some people didn't like it yesterday, while others have reached out and said they did. But I had a long conversation with Kath, and I think that this letter is important and should be tabled.

         As the member for Maribyrnong knows, under the standing orders I need to ask whether leave is granted.

         The problem is, as I am trying to delicately point out, the House has already dealt with that matter.

         Members on my right, the House has already dealt with the matter. I've already put the question to the House, and leave was denied.

         No, I've already put the question to the House. What would follow if I agreed to put this question is to keep putting it again and again. What I would say to the member for Maribyrnong is there are other forms of the House where he can address the subject in the letter: the adjournment debate, 90-second statements and the like. But I'm compelled under the standing orders to ask whether leave is granted. If it's denied, the House has dealt with the matter.
