        The government amendments to the Public Interest Disclosure Bill will improve the operation of the bill and clarify certain provisions. Proposed amendments will implement substantially the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as well as a number of suggestions arising from submissions made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Policy" rel="nofollow">
         Social Policy
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Legal Affairs
        </a>
        and to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of amendments are proposed that will change the requirements to qualify for a protected public interest disclosure. These amendments serve to simplify and clarify some of these requirements and to implement recommendations 2, 3 and 7 of the Senate committee report.
       </p>
       <p>
        These include amendment (21), which will change the criteria for establishing when an investigation or report is taken to be inadequate for the purpose of qualifying for a protected 'external' disclosure. Concerns were raised that the criteria in clauses 37 to 39 would be difficult to apply and should be based on a subjective assessment by the discloser. Amendment (21) will have the effect that inadequacy will be met if a discloser believes on reasonable grounds that the part 3 investigation was inadequate, or a response to an investigation was inadequate, or if a part 3 investigation has not been completed within the required time limit. Only one of these grounds would need to be established to meet the inadequacy requirement for an 'external' disclosure.
       </p>
       <p>
        To give balance to the list of factors that must be taken into account for the purposes of the public interest test for an 'external' disclosure, further factors will be added to the list in subclause 26(3). These include factors favouring disclosure and reflected in the objects of the bill. The existing listed factors weighing against public disclosure of information align with exemptions in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Freedom of Information Act
        </a>
        and will be retained.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments (19) and (20) would amend the criteria to qualify for a protected 'internal' or 'external' disclosure so that a disclosure could qualify for protection where the information tends to show disclosable conduct as well as where the discloser believes on reasonable grounds that the information tends to show disclosable conduct. It will no longer be a requirement to qualify for a protected 'internal', 'external' or 'emergency' disclosure that the disclosure not be contrary to a 'designated publication restriction'. However, it remains important that the protection framework in the bill does not undermine the policy supporting confidentiality of non-publication orders and directions of the kind identified as 'designated publication restrictions' in the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The approach in the amendments is that a discloser will lose the immunity protections in clause 10 of the bill where the discloser knows that the disclosure contravenes a designated publication restriction and does not have a reasonable excuse for that contravention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Making a report of wrongdoing in the workplace can take courage. Public officials need confidence that they will not be exposed to detriment in any way as a consequence of raising concerns about wrongdoing. A number of amendments will further strengthen the protections in the bill for public officials who make qualifying disclosures. Amendment (6) corrects an omission so that the immunity protections given in clause 10 of the bill would only be lost if the discloser knowingly makes a false or misleading statement. This change implements recommendation 4 of the Senate committee report. The penalty for the offences of taking a reprisal or threatening to take a reprisal against a person who has made a disclosure will be increased to two years imprisonment or 120 penalty units or both.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instituting proceedings in a court for redress for alleged detriment as a result of making a public interest disclosure is a decision that most people would not take lightly. Amendment (8) will serve to ameliorate reservations a public official may have to bringing proceedings under the bill arising from exposure to pay a defending party's costs. Under this amendment, a current or former public official who brings an action in the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court for a remedy under the bill could not be ordered to pay the defending party's costs unless the court is satisfied they instituted the proceedings vexatiously or acted unreasonably to cause the other party to incur costs. A court could exercise its ordinary jurisdiction to award costs against a defending agency party. Some amendments will serve to enhance the oversight roles for the ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorised officers in agencies will be required to give the ombudsman and the inspector-general certain details about a disclosure at the time a decision is made on how the agency or agencies will handle the disclosure. This obligation supplements an existing requirement for agencies to give information to the ombudsman about public interest disclosures at the end of each financial year, and that would be used to inform the ombudsman's annual report on the operation of the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the bill now stands, to qualify for a protected internal disclosure a public official must make the disclosure to an authorised officer within the agency. Amendment (19) and related amendments will implement recommendation 1 of the Senate committee's report so that a public official can also make a public interest disclosure to a person who is their supervisor or manager. To complement that amendment, a supervisor would be required to give the information they have received to an authorised officer in their agency where the supervisor has reasonable grounds to believe that the information tends to show disclosable conduct.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        committee suggested that disclosure to a supervisor includes people who are in an indirect supervisory or management relationship. This approach has not been adopted. The concept of a person who indirectly supervises someone in the Commonwealth public sector is potentially very broad. As a supervisor will have an obligation to refer suspected disclosable conduct to an authorised officer, this measure is not intended to apply to a person who would not ordinarily be considered an official's supervisor.
       </p>
       <p>
        It remains an obligation under the bill for a principal officer to ensure there are a sufficient number of readily accessible authorised officers in an agency and to ensure that public officials are aware of the identity of each authorised officer in their agency. An official who does not want to make a disclosure to their supervisor could make a disclosure to an authorised officer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (72) will implement recommendation 5 of the Senate committee report by omitting clause 81 from this bill. Amendment (73) will implement recommendation 6 of the Senate committee report that a review of the operation of the act be undertaken two years after it has commenced. This review will provide a good opportunity for the procedures in the act to be examined, as well as for consideration to be given to widening its application including to members of parliament and to staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the amendments to the House.

          <p>
           The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the way that an ombudsman can investigate a whistleblower and their claim and how it can be treated by the agency concerned. The position underpinning these amendments is, obviously: supporting the principle of whistleblowing and empowering people to take a stand to do what is right and make a positive and lasting contribution to society.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is exactly what whistleblowers do and the Greens unequivocally support their protection under law. But we want a whistleblower scheme that assures people that they will not be the focus of investigation but rather that their allegations will be. However, the way that this bill is drafted shows greater preoccupation with protecting Public Service institutions than with public servants themselves. The government's amendments improve this imbalance, but we still have concerns because the bill sets up so many trip-wires for the whistleblower to navigate and, with one wrong step, they can lose their legal protection. In this respect, we wish that the bill was closer to the legislation that was passed in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           as part of the agreement between the Greens and the Labor Party, which we believe provides a template for simplicity and effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments address a number of issues and I will go through those briefly. First is the question of MPs and their staff. An obvious flaw in the bill is that it does not cover MPs and their staff. Our amendments include them in the operation of this legislation. Members of parliament are imposing standards and obligations on all those working for the Public Service, except themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           This legislation, as currently framed, will do nothing to challenge the public perception that politicians are more interested in arranging their affairs to suit themselves than in vigorously pursuing the public interest. These amendments will bring MPs, ministers, speakers, presidents and their staff into the scheme so that they may raise concerns about misconduct, maladministration and corruption before the consequences escalate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also addressed by these amendments is the question of intelligence agencies. The blanket exemption on externally disclosing all information created or obtained by an intelligence service is so broad it would cover the most remotely incidental and inane material and even covers disclosing material that has already been publicly released.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our moderate amendment simply takes this blanket exemption out and leaves in place the long list of exempt material that would threaten investigations, operational matters and broader national security interests. Without this amendment, our intelligence agencies will be more vulnerable to maladministration and corruption than any other public agency because there are no protected avenues for intelligence officers to disclose information to a third party when internal investigations have been fruitless or thwarted by senior management.
          </p>
          <p>
           These amendments also address the question of act-of-grace payments. Whistleblowers often undergo great personal and financial strain once they have decided to come forward, and this legislation, despite the objects of the act, does not provide enough incentives for someone thinking about doing the right thing and speaking out.
          </p>
          <p>
           One way that the Greens want to provide incentives is for the minister to have an explicit and broad but non-compellable power to make payments to those whistleblowers who, through their disclosures, have saved the government money either through preventing revenue loss or enabling it to be reclaimed.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is also a broad power to reward the discloser in the public interest. Many jurisdictions have improved their public service efficiency and reduced waste through offering payment to disclosers. We should do the same so that there is a chilling effect on those who might engage in wrongdoing but do not in knowledge that their colleague might be rewarded if they expose them. I commend the amendments to the House.

           </small>
           <p>
            The government does not support this set of amendments and, in fact, has moved an amendment similar to amendment (16), which would establish in the bill a requirement for the minister to undertake a review of the operation of the bill two years after it has commenced.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government does not support the act-of-grace amendment—amendment (1). That would authorise a minister to make payments to a person who has made a public interest disclosure where public moneys are reclaimed or where it is in the public interest. The emphasis of the scheme in this bill is on disclosures of wrongdoing being reported to and investigated within government.
           </p>
           <p>
            This bill focuses on removing disincentives to making public interest disclosure by affording robust protections to public officials who come forward to report wrongdoing. I note that the whistleblower protection report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has very much informed the development of this bill, did not make a recommendation that incentives or payments should be made to public officials making disclosures.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government does not support amendment 2. That would remove the word 'imminent' from the criteria for a protected emergency disclosure. The criterion, as it has been drafted in the bill, conforms with the government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs whistleblower protection report. In recommendation 21 of that report, the committee referred to disclosures being made to the media where a matter has been previously the subject of an internal disclosure and has not been acted on in a reasonable time having regard to the nature of the matter and the matter threatens 'immediate, serious harm to public health and safety.'
           </p>
           <p>
            The government response on this aspect, which is, again, reflected in the bill, is that a discloser needs to believe on reasonable grounds that the information concerns a substantial and imminent danger to the health or safety of one or more persons. Again, the focus of the bill is on disclosures being handled within government. A substantial but not imminent threat to public safety may be disclosable conduct for a protected external disclosure if the requirements for that disclosure are met.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amendments that deal with actions by ministers, senators and authorised officers of an agency that is a house of parliament being disclosable conduct—generally, the government does not support the proposed amendments that would apply this scheme to members of parliament or their staff or actions taken by a minister or a presiding officer. Members of parliament and their staff perform roles that are different to Commonwealth public sector agencies and their staff. This difference warrants further detailed consideration, which could be undertaken upon a subsequent review of the operation of the act, which is provided for in the amendment we have moved—a review of the act two years after its commencement.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some amendments relating to what is to occur following an inadequate response to investigation by the minister. Again, the government does not support these amendments. The government has moved amendments that will omit from the bill clauses 38 and 39, which deal with when responses to investigations under part 3 or other investigative powers are taken to be inadequate. The government amendments would instead provide different criteria relating to whether a discloser believes on reasonable grounds that a response to an investigation was inadequate. The government amendments would preserve the principle that a response to a disclosure investigation is taken not to be inadequate to the extent that the response involves action that has been taken by a minister or a presiding officer. This is consistent with the position in the bill that the scheme not apply to conduct of a minister or members of parliament.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coming to the amendments that deal with intelligence information, as I said in my summing-up remarks this bill does apply to intelligence agencies. A public official within an intelligence agency can make a protected disclosure about wrongful conduct in their agency. The restrictions in the bill that relate to intelligence agencies apply to external disclosures. Information that is intelligence information cannot be disclosed outside government and no protection is afforded to any public disclosures of this kind of information.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amendments proposed to the definition of intelligence information would effectively remove paragraph 41(1)(a) of that definition as a separate ground—that is, information that has originated with or has been received from an intelligence agency. Information received from an intelligence agency has to remain undisclosed. It is very important, and that is why those amendments are not supported.
           </p>
           <p>
            A broad approach to what constitutes intelligence information is necessary to avoid subjective misconstruction of the harm that could arise through public disclosure of this kind of information. A discloser may inaccurately assess or be unable to accurately assess the harm that could arise to operations through public disclosure of sensitive intelligence information. Inadvertent or inappropriate disclosure of intelligence information may compromise national security and potentially place lives at risk. Also, Australian intelligence agencies have obligations to their foreign partners to maintain confidentiality of information shared for the purpose of assisting those agencies to fulfil their national security functions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendment (16), the final amendment in this set, is not supported. As I have indicated the government has moved an amendment to the bill that would make provision for a review of the operation of the act within two years.

              I move amendment (1) on sheet 2, as circulated in my name:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              (1) Clause 26, page 23 (table item 3), after "persons", insert "or to the environment".
             </p>
             <p>
              Currently under the bill, only significant and imminent acts that are likely to affect the health and safety of one or more persons can be disclosed to a third party—a journalist or a member of parliament, for example—immediately, without going through internal procedures first. Our amendment will allow an external disclosure to occur immediately where there is a substantial threat to the environment. For instance, under the current wording an oil rig that is likely to pollute an entire marine environment could not be publicly revealed unless it affected the health of the workers, too. This amendment will include the environment as an emergency disclosure and will also restrict disclosures on serious matters that have either already happened or where a time frame is not known to the discloser.
