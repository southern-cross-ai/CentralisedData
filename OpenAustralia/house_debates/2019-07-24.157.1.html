        The late Ian Kennedy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was a true example of someone who selflessly gave of themselves to better the lives of others. Ian was a well-loved member of the Mackellar community, being a great advocate for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Beach
        </a>
        and Pittwater as well as an active member of the Palm Beach and

        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Starlight Foundation
        </a>
        has a mission to let sick kids just be kids by giving them some much needed joy and happiness during often very difficult and challenging times. It is an Australian foundation that has significantly impacted many young families and lives. Ian had been a proud patron of the Starlight Foundation for 29 of its 30 years. Ian was an integral part of the founding board of Starlight and the foundation as a whole. Always the entrepreneur, it was Ian's vision and tenacity which delivered

        from Planet Starlight into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_Express" rel="nofollow">
         Starlight Express
        </a>
        rooms for the sick kids and their families—programs still unique in the world today. He was also a Starlight wish-granting volunteer. He never ceased to be inspired by the joy and hope provided by a life-changing Starlight wish. According to Starlight, whenever a decision was to be made, Ian would ask, 'What would be best for the Starlight child?'
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian will always be part of Starlight. He's in its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
         DNA
        </a>
        . He always sought to be true to Starlight's mission and to brighten the lives of Australia's seriously ill children and their families. Ian went on to be part of the founding board for Livewire, an organisation that supports seriously ill and hospitalised adolescents. For Ian, the need for the children was central to everything. Ian's legacy truly is the thousands of seriously ill children's lives that Starlight brightens every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian is survived by his wife, Susie, his son, Sam, and his five grandchildren. I'm sure they are immeasurably proud of Ian's grand legacy. I will never tire of hearing the remarkable stories of the people of Mackellar, many of whom have had a profound influence on the community. Ian, in his own right, is one of those remarkable people.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we remember Ian today, let us think of a life that was well lived—a life full of purpose. Ian will be dearly missed but his memory will continue on every day as lives are continuously touched by the great work of the Starlight Foundation.

         I understand it is the wish of the Federation Chamber that constituency statements continue for an additional 30 minutes. There being no objection, I call the member for Corio.
