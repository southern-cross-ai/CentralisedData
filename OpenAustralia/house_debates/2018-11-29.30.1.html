        Here is Elliot Crighton's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        saga, part 4. On 19 November, NBN Co advised me that Elliot Crighton's apartment in Coombs was finally activated for service. After 10 days, it wasn't activated. I sought an update from NBN Co, and they've decided to provide Elliot with a case manager. Hurrah, hurrah!
       </p>
       <p>
        I let Elliot know, and he said: 'I appreciate the update; however, I'm not riddled with optimism, as I had an NBN case manager around one to two months ago that was extraordinarily unhelpful and was unable to answer any questions or issues. That particular case manager also took almost two weeks just to report they had no information.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Elliot's provider, Aussie Broadband, told him his apartment has a location number that is provided only after NBN is connected. The apartment developer has no outstanding requests from NBN Co and has tried to contact them on multiple occasions to find out why there is the delay, and all it's been is absolute crickets. From Elliot: 'One possible solution is that the case manager finally advises what needs to be done by the developer before the address is listed as activated, or they simply change the status of the resident from phase 0 to phase 3.' I'm calling on the minister to pay attention to the NBN rollout and pay attention to Coombs, because this is a greenfields site.
