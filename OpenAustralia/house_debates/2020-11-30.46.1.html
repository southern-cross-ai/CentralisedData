        It takes an ecosystem to build a cyber-resilient nation. Our national security agencies alone aren't enough to defend Australia from cyberattacks. A healthy ecosystem relies on cross-pollination from the innovation and insights of a thriving specialist private-sector security company. As the release of today's cybersecurity competitiveness report from AustCyber highlights, this is an opportunity as well as a challenge for Australia. Australia's specialist cybersecurity companies are not only a crucial part of Australia's own cyberdefences; they can also be a world-beating, job-creating export industry if the government backs the sector. Today's AustCyber report shows a sector at a crossroads. There is an opportunity for the sector to more than double its contribution to the economy, to $7.6 billion by 2024, and add 7,000 new jobs, for a total workforce of 33,500—desperately needed jobs during an economic crisis.

        But to do this the industry needs a government that will back it, and, unfortunately, there were no industry development policies or even objectives in the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy.

As former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recently said:

        is particularly interested in it, or familiar with it.

        This weekend, we saw a media drop that said the Prime Minister was planning to promote the cybersecurity portfolio into the cabinet. It will be a surprise to the home affairs minister, who currently sits there.
