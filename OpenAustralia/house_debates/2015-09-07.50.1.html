       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to the 100th anniversary of women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        . This year the New South Wales Police Force celebrates 100 years of women in policing, in what marks a significant milestone for the force. In the course of the past 100 years, work conditions for women in policing have changed dramatically. In 1915 Lillian Armfield and Maude Rhodes were the first two female officers to join the New South Wales Police Force. It took half a century from when Lillian and Maude joined for women to gain full status as officers in the force, thereby entitling them to superannuation and pension benefits.

        I am glad to say that in 2015 the culture and conditions for policewomen are completely unrecognisable from what they were in 1915. Nowadays women can work in any section of the Police Force as long as they have the necessary determination and aptitude, and Campbelltown
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAC" rel="nofollow">
         LAC
        </a>
        is no exception, with women working in every section, ranging from probationary constables to chief inspectors. In total, Campbelltown LAC currently has 85 sworn and non-sworn female staff, which works out to be roughly 50 per cent of their total staffâ€”a remarkable achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month, Campbelltown Local Area Command celebrated 100 years of women in policing at Lithgow Street Mall, which had displays and personnel on show, and the Campbelltown Rotary Club put on a barbecue, with a gold coin donation that went towards the Campbelltown Domestic Violence Committee, who do a fantastic job. I would like to congratulate everybody involved in this landmark event, but most importantly I would like to thank Chief Inspector Meg Grady and all the women at Campbelltown Local Area Command for their hard work and dedication in keeping Campbelltown safe and secure for our community.
