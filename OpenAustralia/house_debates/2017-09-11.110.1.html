       </p>
       <p>
        (20) Schedule 16, item 3, page 227 (lines 6 and 7), omit the item, substitute:
       </p>
       <p>
        3 Subsection 37(8) (note)
       </p>
       <p>
        Repeal the note, substitute:
       </p>
       <p>
        Note: In some cases, the Secretary must not make a determination granting a claim for a seniors health card or an income-tested health care card if the Secretary makes a request under subsection 75(2) or (3) of the claimant (about providing tax file numbers): see subsection 77(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        (21) Schedule 16, item 4, page 227 (lines 8 and 9), omit the item, substitute:
       </p>
       <p>
        4 Subsection 86(1) (note)
       </p>
       <p>
        Repeal the note, substitute:
       </p>
       <p>
        Note: In some cases, the Secretary must cancel a seniors health card or an income-tested health care card if the Secretary makes a request under subsection 75(2) or (3) of the holder (about providing tax file numbers): see subsections 77(1) and (3).
       </p>
       <p>
        (22) Schedule 16, item 5, page 227 (line 12), after "seniors health card", insert ", or a health care card that is income-tested for a person,".
       </p>
       <p>
        The briefest explanation that I can provide with respect to those amendments, of which there are 22, is they are technical but that they amend schedules 10, 12 and 16 of the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments to schedule 10, which deals with the work first component of the bill, are designed to ensure that the ordinary waiting period will apply in the same way to jobseekers who are subject to RapidConnect as to jobseekers who are not subject to RapidConnect.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments that apply to schedule 12, which deals with the drug-testing trial, are designed to refine the definition of 'drug test trial pool member' and give greater support to jobseekers referred to income management for whom the regime could pose any risk to their wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third group of amendments applies to schedule 16 and relates to the streamlining of tax file number issues. These amendments would allow for the request for tax file number provisions in the social security law to apply to a relevant third party as part of a person's claim for social security payment and to an income-tested healthcare card or seniors health card.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
