       <p>
        I rise this afternoon to speak on the 2007 budget and its strong, positive impact on regional Australia. My region of Braddon, as with other regional areas, has received considerable benefit from the 2007 budget. From an Australian economic, social and business perspective, this budget has been a winner for all sectors. The financial outlook includes a strong cash surplus of some $10.6 billion, the 10th consecutive surplus. This is accompanied by a forecast of continued economic growth and by a 30-year low in unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opposition has repeatedly said that our entire economic wellbeing is a result of the mining boom and not of good government and economic and social management. I challenge this. For example, in my own state of Tasmania, economic growth averaged some 3.7 per cent between 2004 and 2006. Nationally, industry grew from 2.7 to 2.9 per cent between 2004 and 2006, while the exports of particular note from my region of Braddon—those of agriculture—nationally have grown an average 23.7 per cent over the two-year period 2004-06. I argue that such growth is not based on a mining boom but on a well-managed economy that allows all sectors to grow. For regional Australia this support will continue during 2007-08 due to the initiatives announced in the budget, not just with the new programs launched but also with those continuing to drive benefits into regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very close to all of my constituents’ hearts is the issue of personal income tax reform. The Australian government has delivered to Australia some $31.5 billion in tax cuts which go directly into the pockets of all Australians, including my local constituents. Other personal relevant initiatives such as superannuation bonuses, increases in pensions and the one-off payment for our aged and less economic sector are all possible due to good governance and good economic management. If a good budget only required placing additional cash in an individual’s pocket then producing a budget would be very easy. However, it is far more complex than that.
       </p>
       <p>
        In regional Australia alone there have been specialised initiatives developed and delivered in such key areas as agriculture, business, industry, communications and society, culture and heritage, economics and finance, education and training, employment, environment and nature, government, health and safety, information and communications, law and justice, science and technology and transport.

        has been tremendously supported by this budget. The Australian government have also committed an additional $314 million in exceptional circumstances assistance, which brings it to a total since 2002-05 of $1.6 billion, some $342 million for improved rural services and $205 million to help primary producers through extending the Agriculture Advancing Australia initiative. From Braddon’s perspective, such programs add to the total investment in my region, contributing significantly towards sustainability and a strong economic advantage for Braddon.

        That builds on, over the last two years, over $70 million in road infrastructure funding to duplicate the

        between Penguin and Ulverstone and some $15 million for the upgrading of the notorious Sisters Hills section between Wynyard and the

        region. The Circular Head region is well renowned for its great agriculture, producing close to 40 per cent of Tasmania’s milk. It has great abalone-processing facilities. It has a flourishing forestry industry. It is one of those areas that certainly has and is in the process of having very good road infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        From Braddon’s perspective, such programs are important to the growth and development of the community. They demonstrate the balance in this budget, in which there are also substantial initiatives to assist our environment. Braddon has secured substantial projects which will assist our community enormously with this precious resource. There has also been significant assistance nationally to our most vulnerable and ill, with $772 million for improved detection and treatment of chronic and complex conditions and $1.6 billion for aged-care initiatives. Our youth have also been well supported with initiatives assisting obesity and childhood illnesses that increase the uptake of sports activities by our young during after-school activities programs. There are programs for youth diabetes and, especially important for our region, there is over $1.2 million for the treatment of youth with mental and social issues. This budget has delivered tremendously well—
