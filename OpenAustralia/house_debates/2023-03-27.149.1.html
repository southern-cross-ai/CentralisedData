       <p>
        April this year will see many in my community celebrating important religious events and festivals. The community of Werriwa is so diverse and multicultural. There are so many different events being held this month where families and friends share each other's company around food and rituals.
       </p>
       <p>
        The holy month of Ramadan began last week and continues until late April, when Eid will be celebrated. I thank everyone in my community who has asked me to join them at iftars during the next few weeks. I will try to attend as many as possible. It's an honour to be invited and to share and learn from you all.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to joining the students and community of

        this Friday afternoon, especially because it's my former high school, and also of Al Amanah College next week to celebrate the 2023 careers dinner. The college invites previous alumni to inspire the current generation to succeed. Their journeys at university and work are always very interesting and very diverse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Easter will be celebrated in April, with Orthodox Easter on 16 April and

        next week. Next week also sees the Assyrian community celebrate their new year. I'm looking forward to joining the celebrations at the Fairfield Showground. For more than 6,000 years the Assyrian people have celebrated the new year at the beginning of spring in the

        as a time of renewal, new beginnings and celebration. This is a significant festival for one of the oldest cultures here in Australia and in the south-west near my electorate. For all those who will be working during Easter and other holidays in April, thank you for keeping Australia running. You deserve the penalty rates, so that we can all enjoy an extended break.
       </p>
       <p>
        April also brings with it school holidays. I'm sure many families will be looking forward to the opportunity to travel, not only in Australia but also internationally, to see family and enjoy time off. This is a perfect time to remind everyone to make the Australian government's Smartraveller website their first destination before they travel overseas. It provides travel advice and assistance for travellers based on who you are, what you'll be doing and even your health. I encourage everyone to look at these resources and advice on the website, so that you can prepare for a fantastic time and not be surprised or have a disappointing holiday.
       </p>
       <p>
        April also sees the commemoration of Anzac Day. It's now 108 years since the first Anzacs landed at Gallipoli. More than 8,000 Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        soldiers lost their lives in the eight months of this campaign. Anzac Day now also acknowledges and, more importantly, remembers all Australians who served and risked their lives, and their families. I'd like to acknowledge and thank everyone who will be organising services in our community, especially the City of Liverpool
