       <p>
        In the short time available I wish to raise three urgent issues. Firstly, I note the tragic passing of young Iranian refugee Omid Masoumali, who set himself alight on Nauru last week after a visit from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
         UNHCR
        </a>
        . He cried, 'This is how tired we are. This action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it anymore.' There are reports that he did not receive timely medical treatment. I agree with Human Rights Commission President Gillian Triggs that:
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a shocking situation that frankly is not a sustainable one.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second urgent issue concerns Iranian asylum seeker Behnam Satah, the key witness to Reza Barati's murder, who is detained on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Manus Island
        </a>
        and who fears for his life after receiving regular death threats including from guards at the detention centre. I reiterate my support and that of the many Australians who signed the petition calling for Behnam to be brought to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, there is the appalling matter of the young African refugee woman who was raped on Nauru while suffering an epilepsy attack and became pregnant as a result. The young woman has been transferred to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
         Port Moresby
        </a>
        for a termination. However, such operations are illegal in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        , and it would be difficult to find a doctor who would have the necessary experience and skills to undertake an operation that will be exceedingly complicated due to the young woman having been infibulated in her childhoodâ€”that is, subjected to the most severe form of female genital mutilation. It is imperative that this young woman be brought to Australia for appropriate treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia bears ultimate responsibility for the plight of this young woman, for Behnam Satah's safety and for Omid's despair. It is time for the government to correct a number of great wrongs and end offshore processing.
