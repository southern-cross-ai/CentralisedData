       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to congratulate the member for Dunkley on her contribution to the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2020 Measures No. 2) Bill 2020. In fact, it's something that I've been reflecting upon. Having listened to the Prime Minister yesterday, you would have thought that most of the problems that beset this country in relation to a global pandemic were solved, but that's not the case. I think it's fair to say that there are some people who, in many respects, feel uneasy about the government's response, and it's something that the government needs to attend to. Firstly, we had the rolling out of the COVIDSafe app, which has become an abject failure—something that was not able to be sufficiently used to contact and trace those people who may have contracted the virus. Secondly, we have many thousands of Australians still stranded overseas and seeking a way to get back to their home country. This government had promised that they would be home by Christmas but has failed in that regard. The government has been derelict in its duty to the many Australians who want to return home but have not been able to find a way home, despite the commitments and undertakings made by the Prime Minister last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are so many things that need to be attended to. As a federal member who wants to look after constituents in his electorate—and I'm sure I am no different from other members—I have had to assist constituents who find themselves overseas in places where they would rather not be during this pandemic and cannot find a pathway home. I've dealt with many, many such constituents. We're aware that there are people in the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Estonia, Ethiopia and many other places who wait for an opportunity to board a plane to come home only to find, too often, that bookings made are cancelled or that planes are cancelled. Their frustration and anxiety continue. On occasion, I have had some good fortune when working with

        , but this just doesn't seem to be a priority or a focus for this government. Notwithstanding that, there does seem to be a lot of hubris in the government's attitude to its response to the pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it would be fair to say—and I've acknowledged this in the past and I do so again—that, whilst I accept that some of the economic responses to the pandemic by the government have been correct, it was indeed Labor that recommended that there be a wage subsidy, and I accept the fact that the government, belatedly but assuredly, got around to doing so. That has been critical, but it wasn't perfect. It didn't cover everybody; it did exclude people unfairly. However, it has been critical, and we would say that Labor played a constructive part in suggesting to the government that this approach be taken. We are happy that the government responded, in the main, by looking after businesses and, effectively, millions of Australian workers. However, it is also true to say that without the very tough decisions of premiers and chief ministers, sometimes contrary to the comments made by the Treasurer and others in this place, we would be in a very different position altogether. If the premiers had not taken the action they took in relation to this pandemic, we would have found ourselves in a very, very different position.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will finish where the member for Dunkley finished her contribution to the debate on the therapeutic goods amendment bill. It is now time that the Prime Minister repudiate the comments made by the member for Hughes, not just because they are not true, not just because it's misinformation, but because it is misinformation with respect to the public safety and the health of fellow citizens, our fellow Australians. This is not just a matter of free speech and opinion. When it contradicts the facts and the facts go to questions of public safety, there is no reason for the Prime Minister not to contradict those comments, condemn the member for making them and make it clear that the government does not stand with the member for Hughes in relation to those statements that have caused anxiety and could lead to death or other forms of—
