       <p>
        I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Denmark and Sweden on 16 to 27 October 2005. I am pleased to be able to table this report on the parliamentary delegation that I led to Denmark and Sweden. The visit provided a valuable opportunity to strengthen relations between our parliament and the parliaments of Denmark and Sweden. In recent years, government-to-government and people-to-people relations have been growing as we have found many issues of common interest which we share with these Scandinavian countries. These include promotion of free trade, combating terrorism and improving the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation’s visit sought to ensure that the parliamentary dimension to our relationship with Denmark and Sweden also received a boost. It also provided an opportunity to gain a better understanding of key issues currently under consideration within the European Union. Danish and Swedish parliamentarians with whom we met emphasised the importance of strengthening contacts between parliamentarians as a way to promote broader cooperation on issues where we share similar approaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation was impressed by the strength of the parliamentary committee system in both Denmark and Sweden. Parliamentary committees in those countries play a vital and very active role in scrutinising both legislation and government administration. From discussions held with Danish and Swedish parliamentary committees, it was evident that there is a range of issues on which we can share information and ideas. These include security, immigration, the ageing population, work-family balance, labour market reform and the environment, to name a few. The delegation was also impressed by the fact that the Danish and Swedish parliaments both determine their own budgets. This helps to reinforce the independence of their parliaments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the visit, it was evident to the delegation that Australia is highly regarded in both Denmark and Sweden. The royal marriage of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_Frederik" rel="nofollow">
         Crown Prince Frederik
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Princess_Mary" rel="nofollow">
         Crown Princess Mary
        </a>
        and the birth of their son have given an extra boost to the relationship with Denmark. The delegation was thrilled to arrive in Denmark the day after the royal birth. The delegation’s visit also preceded last year’s successful visit to Australia by the King and Queen of Sweden.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation found there are significant opportunities for broadening links with Denmark and Sweden in areas such as education and research. The delegation was impressed by the commitment of Denmark and Sweden to research and development.
       </p>
       <p>
        During its time in Denmark, the delegation was fortunate to visit the Foulum Agricultural Research Centre, a most impressive centre on the largest Danish island of Jutland. There the delegation met with a range of Danish research scientists and an Australian research scientist, Dr Mark Henryon, who are working on a range of interesting projects aimed at improving agricultural production and ensuring better environmental outcomes. While these scientists noted that there are contacts between our countries, they said we would greatly benefit from more formalised contacts between our research institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation visited Sweden shortly after the announcement that two Australians,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Robin Warren
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
         Barry Marshall
        </a>
        , had been named as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Laureates" rel="nofollow">
         Nobel Laureates
        </a>
        . We were fortunate to visit the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Museum" rel="nofollow">
         Nobel Museum
        </a>
        in Stockholm and found out that its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Exhibition" rel="nofollow">
         Centennial Exhibition
        </a>
        was not scheduled to visit Australia. The delegation urges the government to examine whether it may be possible to bring the exhibition to Australia, given Australia’s proud association with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" rel="nofollow">
         Nobel Prize
        </a>
        . The meetings and briefings the committee had on energy and environmental issues were also of considerable interest. Information from those briefings is outlined in the delegation’s report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation thanks the Danish and Swedish parliaments for the warmth of their welcome and for the informative program they developed for the delegation’s visit. The delegation also thanks our ambassadors to Denmark and Sweden, Matthew Peek and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rowe" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Rowe
        </a>
        , and their staff for the tremendous support provided to the delegation. We are also grateful to the

         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        , the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office for their contributions to ensuring the success of the visit. I also take this opportunity to thank the delegation’s deputy leader, the member for Chisholm,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Anna Burke
        </a>

Finally, on behalf of all delegates, I would like to thank the delegation secretary, Andres Lomp, whose excellent work in supporting the delegation was a significant factor in the success of the visit. I commend the report to the House.

         by leave—It is certainly a pleasure to address the report on the Australian parliamentary delegation to Denmark and Sweden. On behalf of all delegates, I would like to express my appreciation to the Danish and Swedish parliaments for their hospitality and informative and comprehensive program; to the Australian Ambassador to Denmark, His Excellency Mr Matthew Peek, and Mrs Linda Peek; and to the Australian Ambassador to Sweden, His Excellency Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rowe" rel="nofollow">

        <p>
         Australia’s relationship with Denmark has been strongly enhanced by the marriage of Australia’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Donaldson" rel="nofollow">
          Mary Donaldson
         </a>
         to

          Crown Prince Frederik
         </a>
         of Denmark and the birth of their son and heir to the Danish throne the day before we arrived on our visit, as the Speaker said. Unemployment in Denmark is around five per cent. The labour market in Denmark is based on employer organisations making collective agreements with trade unions. Around 80 per cent of blue-collar workers belong to a trade union. Many labour market issues are dealt with through negotiations between employers and trade unions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Confederation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Industries" rel="nofollow">
          Danish Industries
         </a>
         noted that flexibility is needed for future growth, in accordance with the traditions of the country. The confederation noted the impact of globalisation on local industries in Denmark, which has high labour costs and an ageing population. Danish industry has adjusted to this with less labour-intensive industry and with automation and streamlining of production processes. The Danish parliament is considering pension reforms to increase the age of retirement from 60 to 65 years. The confederation noted personal income taxes to be too high, with a top tax rate of 63 per cent and a value added tax at 25 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Child care is a significant issue, with the government providing subsidies to assist with the cost of child care. Standards have been developed for the education of children in day care centres, allowing women to return to the workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
         Greater collaboration between Danish and Australian scientists to improve knowledge and technology based farming would be welcomed by Danish scientists. A visit to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestas_Wind_Systems" rel="nofollow">
          Vestas Wind Systems
         </a>

         Moller-Maersk, were surprised that we operate five major ports to service a nation of only 20 million people. They believe that fewer ports and more comprehensive transport infrastructure based on rail would provide greater benefits.

           That is another issue. We cannot afford to compete. The Swedish economy has a highly developed, successful industrial sector which is export orientated. The

            Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences
           </a>
           has noted that big business is a key driver of R&amp;D, accounting for three per cent of

            GDP
           </a>
           . Real job growth is still a problem in Sweden. Like Denmark, the issue of migration and sufficient numbers of skilled people needs to be addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sweden and Denmark both share Australia’s concern with the European Union’s
