       <p>
        I've been approached many times about the provision of more mental health services for youth in the beautiful coastal town of Esperance and I'm pleased to say that a new headspace will open in Esperance next week. Since August 2018, I've spoken of the need to increase the service in regional WA, particularly in Esperance where, previously, there had been only one visiting psychiatrist each month and even more limited services for children and youth. I approached Minister Hunt to seek a departmental review of these services, and a needs assessment was conducted. There are more pressures on young people today than ever before and the establishment of this headspace is so important to providing this vital service in Esperance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The headspace program aims to improve access for young people aged 12 to 25 years who have, or are at risk of, mental illness. Headspace is a trusted model of care that is recognised by young people, their families and their communities for providing youth-friendly mental health support. I was pleased that the department agreed that the isolation of the Esperance community warranted more support and have funded a headspace. Headspace delivers quality frontline support and coordinates tailored interventions for at-risk youth. One in four people aged 16 to 24 experiences some form of mental illness every year, and three-quarters of all mental illness manifests in people under the age of 25. Headspace offers early intervention services across four keys areas: mental health, related physical health, social and vocational support, and alcohol and other drug use. I look forward to being in Esperance next week to officially open the new headspace.
