        I rise to pay tribute at the tragic passing of the iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n entrepreneur and businessman Mr Vilmos 'Vili' Milisits, who was, of course, famous in South Australia, across the country and in parts of the world for his eponymous Vili's pie brand. His is one of the great migrant stories in this country. Vili was born in Hungary. In 1956, after the Hungarian revolution and the invasion by Soviet forces, he fled Hungary and came to South Australia. As he would say, he came poor and starving. He made it critical to the rest of his life that he would never again have those two experiences of poverty and hunger.

        He was a great businessman who built his bakery into one of the most iconic food businesses in South Australia. He leaves such a legacy behind, not only in my home state but across the country. Most famously, he successfully supplied all of the pies and pasties for the Sydney 2000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . His business now exports to dozens of countries around the world. He was a great

        . He leaves a spectacular legacy in Adelaide and in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an honour to have known him for so long, to have called him a friend and to have been inspired by him. I pay tribute to him and to the success of his career. I pass on my sympathies to his family, particularly his beloved wife, Rosemary. Vale Vili.
