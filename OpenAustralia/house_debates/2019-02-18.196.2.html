        I recently hosted an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        forum in my electorate, and I would urge every member in this place to do the same. I brought my community together, and together we heard from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        . I'd like to pay special mention to Cheryl Rollison from the NDIA, an incredibly professional woman who worked with my office to pull this together. What we found though was that there is enormous frustration over the rollout of NDIS plans, in particular that participants are not able to see their draft plan, which I find quite ridiculous. Those plans can have wrong birthdates or wrong names on them, and that can lead to weeks of delay and exclusion. We're also seeing that those plans do not have what is requested or needed. I spoke last week about a young gentleman in my electorate with spastic quadriplegia who was invited to get a gym membershipâ€”and he needs some help to open his front door.

        I've asked the minister his position on this. He said that people have the ability to appeal and to go through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        . Families don't want to do this. I would urge this government: just allow participants to view their draft plan. It is not difficult. It will save the government an enormous amount of money, with people getting the right plan from the beginning. I urge this government to please listen to me: listen to our community.
