       <p>
        It is my sad duty to rise in the chamber today to acknowledge the passing of a true champion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        , both on and off the field—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ackerman" rel="nofollow">
         James Ackerman
        </a>
        . He passed away as a result of an injury he sustained while playing for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast_Falcons" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast Falcons
        </a>
        last Saturday. Unfortunately, he never regained consciousness, having been involved in a tackle only five minutes into a game against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norths_Devils" rel="nofollow">
         Norths Devils
        </a>
        at Bishop Park. Ackers, as he was known, played junior football for the Kawana Dolphins and for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Creek_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Mountain Creek State High School
        </a>
        . As I said, he was a champion on and off the field. The club, as a sign of respect, has hung up his No. 8 jersey.
       </p>
       <p>
        His parents, Sonya and Michael, who I have spoken to, have ensured his organs have been donated. This means he will live on, with up to 10 other people’s lives being saved as a result of that generosity. The Sunshine Coast community, the rugby league family and all those close to him can be assured that we will continue to look after Saraa and his young children, Olliver and Milly, and know that his respect for life, his joy for life and the friends that he made will serve his family well in the years to come. We are privileged to live in a generous community. We have been privileged to know him. We will ensure his memory lives on. His funeral will be held on 1 July at 11 am at the Sunshine Coast Stadium. I encourage the Sunshine Coast community to join me there for his commemoration.
