        Over the weekend, I was privileged to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of the Centenary Rowing Club. This club is one of the largest rowing clubs in Queensland, having been founded in 2001 by Mr Russell Pool and Mr Peter Cook, as part of the Centenary Canoe and Rowing Club. Back then, this club's operations were run out of the back of the Jindalee Scout Hall and the club held meetings at the Mount Ommaney Library or members' houses. They had only one rowing boat, a tub pair, stored under black plastic in the grass, that was used on occasion when members wished to go for a social row. Well, how far they've come! Over the past 20 years, this organisation has grown into a hugely successful club that has developed excellent rowers who've had the opportunity to compete across the country.

        I was incredibly privileged over the weekend to meet one of the club's stand-out rowers, Sophie Malcolm. Sophie recently won single scull at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rowing_Championships" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Rowing Championships
        </a>
        in Tasmania, which was her third time on the podium. Representing Centenary Rowing Club, she took out gold for the under-17 scull and also silver in the under-21 lightweight single scull events. Sophie's contributions to the club and to the sport were honoured at the 20th anniversary celebration on Saturday with the naming of the new Sophie Malcolm rowing boat. Her sister was granted the honour of breaking the champagne on the boat, while her proud mum and dad looked on. Congratulations to the Centenary Rowing Club for their 20 years of rowing excellence, and particularly to Sophie for her many achievements in the sport. Well done, Centenary Rowing.
