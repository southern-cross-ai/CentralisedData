        The Redlands Coast is an iconic place. It offers many of us a convenient escape from the hustle and bustle, and I could argue that there's really no place worldwide which offers that subtropical lifestyle, with island and bay benefits, less than an hour from a major city. So this is about the

        City Dealâ€”three levels of government finally working together on something so important. It's based around transport projects, jobs and liveability.

        Liveability is about quality of life. We talk about it here a lot, but not in these words. The built and natural environments; economic prosperity; social stability and equity; educational opportunity; and cultural, entertainment and recreational possibilities: we can all agree on these, and it's time to move beyond the family feud of development versus environment. What makes it better to live here as locals? I don't want my suggestions to limit this debate today. I'm writing to every elected representative in my area and asking them about recreational assets, active transport, renewable energy and island and water based activities that make living in Redlands genuinely the best place to be in the world. Those benefits that we know well are things that the rest of the world will see in 2032. Let's make sure that we have everything planned so that over the next decade we can achieve being truly the world's greatest and most liveable city.
