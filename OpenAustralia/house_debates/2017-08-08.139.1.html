        On Tuesday 1 August the Goldstein electorate office launched a new community space after renovation to make sure there were facilities for the community to come and meet and work with the staff at the Goldstein office and also, of course, me as the local federal member. I am excited at the opportunity this will provide all Goldstein community groups and residents to come and build a relationship, to meet and advocate for the causes and activities that they passionately support and request help where they need it. As local members, it is the responsibility of each of us to champion our communities, support them and serve them. It's my pleasure to introduce to Goldstein space that will serve the fundamental democratic duty by facilitating support and commendation of the wonderful work done by all people within the Goldstein community.
       </p>
       <p>
        To launch this important community space, we held our first community morning tea, where we met to honour around 50 Goldstein constituents, all of whom are high achievers in a variety of fields. Among the very impressive Australians in attendance were sporting champions including young Miss Emily Barrow, who competes in international gymnastics competitions; Mr Ethan Lambie-Downie, who is an up-and-coming cricketer and a talented all-rounder; Mr Zak Bahramis, a state champion in baseball; and a young lady who deserves our great admiration and respect, Ms Sara Molloy, a silver medallist at the

        winter games in Austria. We make them well in Goldstein.
       </p>

        I had the privilege of meeting and learning about the work of some constituents who have made contributions in the noble fields of mental health awareness and services.

        ; Mr John Fowler OAM; Dr David Larkin AM GAICD; Mr Alastair Murray AM, who likes to joke about the fact he has now has an honorific that reflects his initials; and Mr Phillip Wheatley OAM. We also paid tribute to some highly creative community servants, like Lenna Krooglik, who pioneered a program to bring her dog along to the aged care centre which she manages; Sam Beagley, who played the trumpet in the recent Melbourne Youth Orchestra's 50th birthday concert; and innovative small business owners Mr and Mrs McIntyre, who founded Beautifinda, a service designed to connect consumers with beauty professionals. It was an utterly enriching experience, showcasing the best that Goldstein has to offer to our nation.
