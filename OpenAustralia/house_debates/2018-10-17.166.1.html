       <p>
        I rise today to praise and recognise the work of two outstanding community champions: Jenny Colvin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Ruth Murray
        </a>
        . About two months ago Ruth and Jenny came into my office to talk to me about the drought. Doveton is a long way away from farming communities, but they were profoundly affected by the footage of the drought and the drought-affected farmers. Like many Australians, they wanted to help in any way they could. That's the Australian way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being very special people, they decided to embark upon a fundraiser. These are people of limited means. They have been known in the Doveton area for many years for putting on an incredible Christmas light display, which they handmade. Many people from all over the region would come to see this incredible Christmas light display. But because of the health of one of the two people I've mentioned, they could not proceed with that, so these two people from Doveton decided to mount this fundraising event with basically no money. They organised an event in the John Pandazopoulos Hall on 7 October. They organised bands, who donated their time free of charge. They did some fundraising. They had a garage sale. They sold their own things and they raised $400.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, they arranged this event on 7 October. It was attended by many hundreds of people. It was an amazing event. When I turned up on Sunday, 7 October it was hard not to be impressed by the sheer level of organisation, persistence and hard work. It paid off. Two normal people wanted to make a difference, and they did. The live bands had people on their feet dancing. It was a great afternoon. The volunteers who turned up brought plenty of homemade cakes, sandwiches and Devonshire tea. The leftover food that wasn't sold was donated to a local charity for those who are less fortunate. The raffle prizes and auction items that were donated by the volunteers and local businesses raised money. How much do you think they raised? They raised $8,000. These were two very special people of limited means, who, basically, went there, organised a hall, organised for the bands to donate their time free of charge and then raised $8,000 which went to this great relief body called Drought Angels. They are farming women who decided to help farmers in need and distress. In the south-eastern region of Melbourne, if something goes wrong—for example there have been some difficulties in Lynbrook—you read about it on the front page of

        , but you never read about this, about two Australians who just wanted to make a difference and to help farmers. So to Ruth and Jenny, on behalf of the community, thank you again. You are true community champions.
