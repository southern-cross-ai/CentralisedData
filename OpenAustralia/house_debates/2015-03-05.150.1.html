        I have the great privilege of recognising those in my community who have received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        Community Awards. On Saturday 18 October, I had the privilege of hosting the inaugural La Trobe Community Awards. The awards were designed to acknowledge the quiet achievers, volunteers in the seat of La Trobe. The people nominated simply amaze me with their dedication and commitment and the countless volunteer hours they spend every day helping the volunteer organisation they are involved with. It was a very difficult job to determine who would receive the La Trobe Community Medallion, and in actual fact it was a tie.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first medallion went to someone I have known for many years, Gwen Homer, who, over a 65-year period, has volunteered with the Sassafras-Ferny Creek Fire Brigade, the Dandenong Ranges Fire Brigade Group's Ladies Auxiliary, the Ferny Creek Tennis Club and even the local church—which, can I say, my mother also attends. Gwen has been a willing supporter, never missing an opportunity to bake a cake or collect donations wherever she can, and she has become an integral part of the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community. Over the years, Gwen has helped out with the Ferny Creek Tennis Club, where she has been a member since 1949—which is quite an amazing effort—helping the membership grow from 40 to 300. Her generosity has not stopped there, with Gwen also being a valued member of the Ewing Memorial Uniting Church—creating beautiful floral displays and serving as the treasurer of the Uniting Church Fellowship Group. Gwen is known by her community as a selfless and loving community member.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second La Trobe Community Medallion went to somebody who is with the Hills Autism and Special Needs Support Group, who also volunteers with both Emerald Community House and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrave_South" rel="nofollow">

        Community House and is the founder of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Made_It" rel="nofollow">
         We Made It
        </a>
        group. Sharyn Thomas conducts monthly mothers' group meetings and is the convener of many special needs functions and events throughout the year. Sharyn's service to the community does not stop there; she also volunteers her time to the Emerald and Belgrave South community houses, where she runs weekly cooking classes for people with special needs. I congratulate Sharyn for that. These programs assist people with special needs to participate in daily living skills to help with their independence, along with assisting with numeracy and literacy skills. Sharyn is the founder of the group We Made It. Craft items are made by people affected by autism or special needs, and they are then sold at the Emerald market craft store. Sharyn's work for and dedication to people with special needs and autism is an inspiration to everyone right across the country.
       </p>

        I would like to mention other community awards recipients. Beryl Bartacek has worked with Nobelius Heritage Park and Emerald Museum for close to 20 years. Ray Boatman has been a valued member and meeting convenor of the Dandenong Ranges Branch of the

        since 1951 and over the years has been a member for a wide variety of community organisations. Margaret Edgar has contributed countless hours assisting children with the environmental program at Maranatha Christian School. Anne Elizabeth has become a great champion for her local community and environment, being an active member of six local community groups. Emily Fitzgerald has been a volunteer at the Coonara Community House for nine years, since the age of 14. It was great to see a number of young people receiving awards. Brady Graham from
