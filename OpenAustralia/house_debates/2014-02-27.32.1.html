        I pay tribute to Harry Malone, a well-known businessman and community volunteer in our community. Harry passed away on 10 February at the age of 91. Harry was born in Randwick and attended

        . He was an accomplished junior sportsperson but left school early to take on an apprenticeship as a mechanic. On the completion of his trade Harry put up his age to enlist in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">

        to serve in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        . He served for four years in

        </a>
        . The only thing good out of war, according to Harry, was the lifelong friendships that he made. Upon his return from the war he set up a garage business in Bathurst, where he met his beautiful wife, Catherine, and they went on to have four children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harry eventually returned to the east of Sydney and established his famous car yard in Kingsford, Harry Malone Motors, on the corner of

        </a>
        and Botany Street. I used to ride past it on my bike when I was going to university. Harry worked in this yard on his own until his retirement at the age of 87. When he did retire, Harry held the oldest dealers licence in

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a wonderful community volunteer at the Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club, a foundation member of the Maroubra Seals Club and a president of Maroubra Rotary. Quite simply, Harry was a great Australian. May he rest in peace.
