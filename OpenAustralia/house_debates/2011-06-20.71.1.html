        I want to do a regional round-up of the good things that have been happening in my seat of Page over the last months, but particularly over the last few weeks. Two Sundays ago I was privileged to attend a luncheon at the Quota International Conference. The international president, Gwenn Jackson, was present. She is from the United States. It was held at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        in Ballina. There was a handover to the international president elect, Chris Tracey-Patte, who is from Beaudesert. So it was being handed over from someone from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        to an Aussie. That was a really nice happening. The topic was 'The Strength of Women' and three women spoke from three different generations: one who had been a boat person from Vietnam, who is now a very successful dentist in Kyogle; a high school student; and also someone who was representative of the war period. They talked about the strength of women, women in the community and women giving service to their community and families. It was a really nice luncheon to be at.

        Last weekend was the Primex event . It is a national event, which is held in Casino. It is a three-day exhibition, held annually in June. It always follows the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        long weekend. It is one of the prime events. There are 12 exhibitions in one. It covers a motor show, trucks and machinery and the Pacific beef trade. It followed the successful Beef Week in Casino, which was one of the most successful to date in nearly 30 years of having Beef Week.

        Also, the senior reporter of our local paper,

        </i>
        , confessed to being a former city slicker and a convert to country areas. It was his first Primex event and he is sold on it. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Northern Rivers is fast becoming a significant food bowl for the nation, producing such diverse crops as macadamias, soy beans, coffee and blueberries.
       </p>
       <p>
        He talked about the importance of our primary industries. Director Bruce Wright, of the Wright family, who, amongst other things, hosted and organised this premier event, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … our primary industries are once again expanding into new areas to support the region's next stage of economic growth.

        On Saturday night I attended the Surf Life Saving Far North Coast Branch Inc. Awards of Excellence. That particular branch covers 10 branches and those branches also cover some of the areas in the area of my colleague the member for Richmond. So some of those people were present as well. It was a lovely evening in Ballina where there are a whole lot of life members. Some people have also got life membership. Some of the younger ones, including Alyce Bennett and

        -ed by two of the young lifesavers and Wilson Cregan, who is the president. He keeps trying to retire, but they will not let him go because he does such a good job. He is still there. It was a successful night.
       </p>

        I give credit to Debbie Pawsey, Director of Administration, for all the wonderful work she does. I would also like to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams" rel="nofollow">
         John Adams

        , who was in the Queen's Birthday honours list, getting an

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        . They have done amazing things in the community—a lifetime of service. I wrote to John and, among other things, I said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am thrilled that your marvellous volunteer work at the Alumny Creek Public School Museum and on other significant community projects has been nationally recognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        John and his wife, Shirley, are a partnership in community service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just ending the regional round-up, I will turn my mind to an international happening, well worthy of mention and support of all members in this chamber. Mr Speaker, you might have seen that women in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">

        are saying that they want to get their drivers licence. They took to the streets. I was reading in the paper, and it said it was 1990 when they first demonstrated. I thought, 'Goodness, that long ago!' but I remembered it well. It seemed like only yesterday. They took to the streets again the other day, and I say, 'Well done, and we stand with you.'
       </p>

        Question agreed to.
