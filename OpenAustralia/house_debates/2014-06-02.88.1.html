           She is a leader in that area, and I acknowledge the very important work that she does. The universality of Medicare is important, and this is what the Hawke government had to say when they introduced a co-payment: 'The government has not changed the universality of Medicare.

               The reality is that, when the Hawke government introduced a co-payment, they did so because they wanted to see Medicare sustainable. Labor can pretend that they can rack up debt for ever more, that they can give free services to all Australians, and that somehow the party can continue on. The reality is—and the Australian people know this: it can't; it just can't. Ten years ago we were spending $8 billion a year on Medicare; today we are spending $20 billion a year. As a Commonwealth, we spend $65 billion a year on health; the Medicare levy raises $10 billion. I want to make sure that, as our population ages, and as we get medical services, new technologies,

               testing and genomics testing—all of this, which will be important for us to fund into the future—we have a sustainable Medicare.

               The Labor Party believed in well-thought-out public policy, once upon a time. When Labor were in government, they put money into

               super clinics. They put it into wasteful programs, including increasing the number of people in the health bureaucracy. But it was not always the case. Back in the Hawke years,

                <p>
                 The Minister for Health is now precisely providing information which the member for Jagajaga has previously explained to the House is false. And I do ask you, on that basis, to intervene.

However, on the question of standing order 68, I will consider the implications of standing order 68 and not rule on it straightaway, but in the interim the Minister for Health has the call.

                   We know the member for Fraser—he is in some sort of protection racket at the moment; he has not been out in the press—was a daily offender out there in front of the cameras; he loves the cameras. But they have had him in hiding for the last week. We know, as the son of Bob Hawke, he is here as the defender-in-chief of Medicare's sustainability. He wants a co-payment. He has written about it, and the Labor Party should listen to one of their up-and-coming member's wise views within the Labor Party. He deserves listening to.
