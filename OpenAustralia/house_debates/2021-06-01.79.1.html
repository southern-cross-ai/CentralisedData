        My question is to the Prime Minister: Why did the government end its program to stop aged-care staff working across multiple facilities in November last year before a single Australian had been vaccinated?

         I'm actually pleased to receive this question and, in particular, to address the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. It considered the single-site worker program was considered by the principal medical expert panel of Australia on 9 November and was tabled in the national cabinet on 13 November 2020.

          If I
         </a>
         may, I will turn exactly to the words within the Updated National COVID-19 Aged Care Plan, adopted by the AHPPC and tabled at the national cabinet on single-site workforce arrangements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Single site workforce arrangements are a useful tool in mitigating the risk of COVID-19 being unintentionally transmitted across aged care facilities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is acknowledged that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         • Single site arrangements are complex and should not be required where there is a low risk of COVID-19
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         • It is important that the sector and government are prepared to implement single site arrangements quickly, where required, and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         • The design of single site arrangements needs to consider employment relations and workforce protections, workforce capacity, and coverage in terms of sectors …
        </p>
        <p>
         That was the nationally agreed aged-care plan that was adopted by AHPPC and tabled. The actions that were taken were precisely in line. The same single-site workforce arrangements were triggered by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer on Thursday of last week when he declared a Commonwealth hotspot, precisely in line with the agreement across all states and territories.

         I would note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Health Services Union
         </a>
         took an aged-care provider to the Fair Work Commission in March last year and was successful in that case against an aged-care provider which had themselves wanted to implement a single-worker policy. So it was not supported by the union. I would also note in relation to that that one of the other things which has been—

           I would add two things to earlier answers. Of course, there are 50 roving pop-up clinics which are being delivered directly into facilities this week. The Victorian model is different to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           model. So not one or two but 15 roving models are being delivered directly, as in reach, for aged-care workers in facilities as well as for residents. In addition, a question was raised by the member for Isaacs. I believe he is referring to the facility Grand Villa Mentone. That is not a Commonwealth residential aged-care facility. It is due to be done by the Victorian government.
