        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to comments recently made by the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        regarding tax increases to pay for the future of Australia’s health system, and I quote:

       <p class="italic">
        Those on higher incomes might be able to bear more of the cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Treasurer agree with the minister for health that taxes will increase to pay for the government’s health plan?

         The opposition are so desperate that they are asking yesterday’s question and the answer is the same today. I agree with what the Prime Minister had to say yesterday.

          <p>
           If they wanted to have a debate about taxes they could have asked the finance minister about a statement he made 15 years ago. Four years ago the Leader of the Opposition had a lot to say about taxation. In fact, he put forward something like 280 separate proposals. They were not ones that impressed the then Treasurer, who had a few choice words to say about the Leader of the Opposition—but we will come back to that.

              I must correct the record. I have just been reminded by one of my colleagues that there were not 280 proposals, there were 279. Some of them were real doozies. Option 124, for example: abolishing the top two tax rates to have one at 15 per cent and one at 30.

                    Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing order of relevance, the Treasurer is clearly defying your admonition of him. These answers have nothing whatsoever to do with the question about the minister for health’s prediction of higher taxes.

                      When talking about tax, the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite have a very clear record over a long period of time. They are very strong in taxing the weak and very weak in taxing the strong! It has been demonstrated in this House time and time again. We on this side of the House understand the importance of the national interest. We understand the importance of getting incentive right—that when people work hard they get a bit extra in their hands. That incentive is so important. It is why personal tax reform is so important. It is important when it comes to company tax. It is important when it comes to the reform of federal-state relations—

                        and we will not be deterred by those opposite in putting forward reforms from the Henry report, when it is brought together and published, considering those in a methodical way and acting in the national interest. As for the minister for health, she is a terrific health minister.
