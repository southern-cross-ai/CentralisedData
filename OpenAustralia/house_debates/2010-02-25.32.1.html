        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. How has the government responded to reports of the misuse of Australian passports? How have successive Australian governments ensured the integrity of Australian passports?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. His question is in two parts. Firstly, I want to again draw to the attention of the House the remarks I made earlier about the investigation by Dubai authorities of the use of three Australian passports and the investigation that the government has asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         to effect. I have reported that matter to the House and I have made public remarks. I do not intend to go through that again, other than to advise the House that, as I indicated publicly, I made representations to Israeli Ambassador Rotem this morning. On the government’s instructions these same representations were effected by Australian officials in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv" rel="nofollow">
          Tel Aviv
         </a>
         early this morning—sometime between 4.30 am and 5.00 am Tel Aviv time—underlining the point of the Australian government’s seriousness about these matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second part of the member’s question goes to how over a period of time successive Australian governments have worked very hard to seek to ensure the integrity and the sanctity of the Australian passport system. I am not the first occupier of this office or the first member of the executive to make the point that, despite all of the best procedures adopted by Australia for its passport system over the years and despite our world-class reputation, there will still be occasions where our passports can be used by people badly motivated and often with criminal intent. There will be occasions where passport fraud and passport identity lapses occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the particular case that has been drawn to attention today, there were three passports involved and they were issued in 2003. They were from what was called the L series passports. Those passports are valid for 10 years and they are usable Australian travel documents. There are some 200,000 L series passports in existence. The so-called L series passport was introduced in late 2003, and the M series ePassport was introduced in October 2005. This was the first ePassport that included microchip technology for the storage of personal information on the passport. This was regarded as a substantial breakthrough in technology, in integrity and in security. In May last year I launched the so-called N series, the latest of the Australian passport series, which enhances that technology. In terms of the series of passports over the years, there was the L series in 2003 and the M series ePassport in October 2005 and now there is the N series, which I have referred to. People should understand very carefully that no one is suggesting that there is any need to replace old passports. While passport fraud does occur in Australia, there is a low incidence of serious fraud when compared to other countries but when we do find these instances of fraud they are very extensively pursued. As I have indicated, the technology that we use is regarded as world class.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this matter I have indicated to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that a briefing on the particular matter is available to her from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         ; the same, I understand, has been offered to the Leader of the Opposition in the usual way. I have seen the Deputy Leader of the Opposition try and make some connection today between this matter and the visa system rollout referred to in the white paper. Whilst both matters go to people movement and the integrity of passport and visa systems, there is no linkage between the two. I just simply make that point.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was more concerned, frankly, when I read the reference the Leader of the Opposition made this morning at a doorstop. The transcript reads:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         QUESTION:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Just on another issue, just with the Australia passport holders, how concerned are you?
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Stephen Smith

         ’s calling the Israeli Ambassador to discuss this problem.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         TONY ABBOTT:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Obviously I think it is an issue. I think that the security of our passport system is important and I guess I would want to know why the Government hasn’t ensured the security of our passport system. I mean, why didn’t the Government put in place a passport system that could not be subjected to this kind of scamming?
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the Leader of the Opposition should take up the briefing, and I am very happy to add the Australian Passport Office. I would very gently make this point: the three passports involved were issued in 2003. The last time I looked, Leader of the Opposition, in 2003 you were a minister in a previous government—a member of the executive which oversaw the issuing of that passport. You should think very carefully before you speak on these matters. Successive Australian governments, including my predecessor in 2003, have worked very hard to make sure of the integrity of the Australian passport system and, frankly, Leader of the Opposition, you should know better.
