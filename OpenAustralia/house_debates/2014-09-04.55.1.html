        I was privileged recently to see Margaret Considine and Nevin Lamont awarded Meritorious Service Awards by the Prime Minister, a rare honour bestowed upon very few people across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Margaret Considine joined the Liberal Party in the early 1970s. She has served in many crucial positions for our party, none more rewarding than when she was campaign manager in the 1979 state election, for Harold Allison, who was elected and became education minister. Margaret also served as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        president and many times has been a member of our party's candidate review committee. When asked what her fondest memories were of her time in the party, she nominated the period we were in government in

        following the 1979 election. In more recent times—I am deeply humbled and surprised to say—Margaret nominated both my and Troy Bell's election to parliament as a highlight, given that we are both

        men born and bred. Margaret's dedication to our party in Mount Gambier is beyond reproach. She is an inspiration to other branch members and a wealth of knowledge, experience and wisdom.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge Nevin Lamont for his enduring and loyal service to the Liberal Party. Nevin has been a dedicated servant of the party for over 57 years, in which time he has worked on every single federal and state campaign. Nevin is currently treasurer of the Barker

        , Mount Gambier SEC and Mount Gambier branch. Nevin comes from impressive stock: he is the grandson of a former member for Barker, Malcolm Duncan Cameron, who served in this place from 1922 to 1934.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to pay tribute to these wonderful friends who are pillars of the Mount Gambier community and of the Liberal Party. Congratulations, Margaret and Nevin.
