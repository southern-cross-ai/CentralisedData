       Responses; Philippines: Social Security Agreement
      </h5>
      <p class="italic">
       Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2008 about a petition submitted to the Committee about a social security agreement between Australia and the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia currently has 21 bilateral social security agreements. A number of factors are considered in deciding whether to enter into negotiations with another country. It is a pre-requisite that the other country has a compatible social security system and that an agreement is likely to be mutually beneficial. Other relevant factors include people-to-people links, the level of business activity, community and political pressure, broader bilateral relations and costs to the Budget.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Officials from my Department met with representatives of the Philippines Embassy on 21 November 2008 for discussions in connection with this matter.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       My Department is currently negotiating a number of social security agreements on behalf of the Australian Government and there are a number of long standing formal approaches from other countries seeking to commence negotiations. The petition for an agreement with the Philippines will be considered as part of a review of priorities for future social security agreements.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you again for writing.
