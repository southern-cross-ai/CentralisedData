        My question is to the Prime Minister. How will the newly announced Defence Strategic Review ensure that Australia is best prepared for the defence and security challenges we face?

         I thank the member for Lingiari for her question. Australians know we're facing the most complex strategic environment that we've encountered as a nation in over 70 years. We live in an area of strategic competition and increased tension. We will work with partners to promote peace and stability in our region, and we've already begun repairing some of the relations in the region. But we do have a capability gap in so many areas. It demands a very frank assessment of our defence capabilities and our pipeline—making sure we can be absolutely confident we are getting it right, that every dollar is going into the right area, that it's money that is well spent. We want to ensure that the ADF is well positioned to meet the nation's security challenges over the decade and beyond
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why today—once again, consistent with the announcement that I made in my speech on the 70th anniversary of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         and consistent with my speech to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowy_Institute" rel="nofollow">
          Lowy Institute
         </a>
         prior to the election—we've announced a holistic consideration of force structure and posture, of force disposition, of preparedness and of strategy and associated investments. We've appointed the former Minister for Defence and former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Professor Stephen Smith, and the former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         , Sir Angus Houston, to be the independent leads on this—a unique blend of knowledge and experience. We want to take stock of the billions of dollars in defence programs, many of which are over budget and are delayed. There are currently 30 major defence projects running a total of 79 years late. We're going to make sure that Defence has the capability and force structure that is fit for purpose, that is affordable and that delivers the greatest return on investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reviewers will of course work with the Chief of the Defence Force,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
          Angus Campbell
         </a>
         , and the secretary of the department, Greg Moriarty, and others in the Defence Force area, and we want to make sure that people get this analysis at the same time as the review is taking place into a way forward in terms of the Future Submarine Program. It is important, given the relationship with AUKUS as well, that we have this solid, comprehensive review because it is in our national interest to do so, and that is why the government has made this position.
