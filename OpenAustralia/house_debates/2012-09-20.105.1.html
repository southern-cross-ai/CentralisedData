       <p>
        I want to make some comments about the events in Sydney on the past weekend that saw a demonstration against a video insulting the prophet Mohammad degenerate into a violent rampage that not only led to damage of property and the breaking of the law but also bought into question once again—from some—the value of multiculturalism to the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me reaffirm my condemnation of those who showed no respect for law and order. I deplore their behaviour and, in particular, want to make the point that this behaviour does a great disservice to their community, who often have to bear the brunt of the consequences of this aggression.
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiculturalism is a term we have used for decades to essentially describe the culturally diverse nature of the Australian community, a community that has been built on generations of migration from across the world. Multiculturalism has worked in this country, despite the experience of other countries. Australian multiculturalism is unique and it has been successful, in spite of some and despite the events in Sydney last Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night I attended the inaugural Australian Multicultural Council Lecture delivered by Mr Frank Lowy, an eminent Australian and a migrant success story, I agree with Mr Lowy that multiculturalism is indeed a work in progress that needs to be taken to the next level, but is an inherently successfully piece of work. I also agreed with the Prime Minister when she said that multiculturalism is about a balance between rights and responsibilities—and I am heartened to hear the opposition leader reflect on the value of multiculturalism and voice his support for the valuable contribution it has made to the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is all too easy for critics of multiculturalism to cite events of last Saturday as evidence for why we should abandon multiculturalism or indeed as examples of how it divides Australians and causes ghettos, or as examples of the failure of Muslims, in this instance, to integrate. I have in the past rejected these assertions and will continue to do so, because the empirical evidence of the past decades points to a successful coherent Australian community, not perfect, but overwhelmingly successful. I am not one of those people who, as Senator Cory Bernadi suggests, naively:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … cling to the romantic idealisation of the generations of migrants who have successfully settled in Australia, thinking things will continue just as they have in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leadership is important on this issue and I want to refer to the wise and admirable leadership shown by members of my community in Melbourne this week. I refer to the leadership shown by La Trobe University's Professor Joseph Camilleri, who is the Director of the Centre for Dialogue, who convened a press conference on Tuesday at which there were present religious leaders of the Islamic and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Christian" rel="nofollow">
         Coptic Christian
        </a>
        communities, who came together to denounce the weekend violence and to denounce the film, which denigrates the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet_Mohammed" rel="nofollow">
         Prophet Mohammed
        </a>
        , which indeed led to those actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay particular tribute and express my gratitude to His Grace Bishop Suriel of Melbourne and Affiliated Regions who cares deeply for and advocates strongly for the plight of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Christians" rel="nofollow">
         Coptic Christians
        </a>
        and works tirelessly for the Coptic Christian community here in Australia. His leadership in joining with leaders of the Muslim community is to be commended. The community leaders from Melbourne's Muslim community also need to be commended for the work they do in promoting inter-faith dialogue. I want to mention Sheik Riad Galil,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , Imam of the West Heidelberg Mosque, Mr Mohamed Elmasri, Islamic community liaison officer, and my very good friend Mr Nail Aykan, who is the general manager of the Islamic Council of Victoria. I also want to commend the Egyptian Consul-General, Mr Khaled Rizk, who was also present at the press conference on Tuesday.
       </p>
       <p>
        The leaders of both communities were at one in denouncing the video, in rejecting any attempt at vilification aimed against any religion and in upholding the right of people to engage in peaceful protest and express their views, as long as this is done without verbal or physical violence aimed at authorities or people of other faiths.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Egyptian Muslim and Coptic communities have for some time been in consultation with the Centre for Dialogue, exploring the prospects of coming together to discuss issues of common concern. Last weekend's events have strengthened their resolve to do so. I want to commend their work and I want this parliament to recognise their work and encourage the very good work they do.
