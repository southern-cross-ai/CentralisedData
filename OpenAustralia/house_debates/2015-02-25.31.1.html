        Members know of my keen interest in organ and tissue donation and transplantation matters. I have seen firsthand the difference that transplantation can make to those who have been incredibly ill. I have also seen the difference it can make to families who take that enormous and difficult decision to donate their loved one's organs. Many of them gain comfort knowing that something good has come from a sudden, unexpected and tragic death. They know they are saving and improving the lives of others. It is a selfless decision at a time of tragedy. I urge all members to continue to take a leadership role on this important issue. We need to ensure our loved ones are aware of our decision to donate our organs and tissues.
