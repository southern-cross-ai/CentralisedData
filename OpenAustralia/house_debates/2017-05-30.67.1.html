        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on action the government is taking to strengthen rules around obtaining Australian citizenship? Why is it important for aspiring Australians to share Australian values, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

          The minister for immigration will refer to members by their correct titles or he will find I will move to the next question just as fast.

          <p>
           That is fair point, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, the Turnbull government, as you know and as every member in this place knows, is taking significant action to strengthen our citizenship laws, because, like any other country in the developed world, we want to make sure that people whom we welcome as Australian citizens are the best people that can become Australian citizens. The fact is that Australian citizenship is an absolutely extraordinary privilege. Obtaining citizenship should be more than just passing an administrative process or a test at a point in time. Aspiring Australians should demonstrate their commitment to Australian values.
          </p>
          <p>
           It has been five weeks since the government made this announcement, yet we have still not heard from the Leader of the Opposition as to what his position would be in relation to this fundamental change in government policy. Mr Speaker, what has become evident over the course of the last five weeks is that, on a fundamental issue, you would have thought the Labor Party could unite, but they have not. What is evident is that, just like their boat policy, we can see on this policy that the Left and the Right of the Labor Party are completely divided. And you have seen games being played on the front bench of the Labor Party over the course of the last few weeks, and it is clear in this debate that the member for Sydney and the member for Grayndler—

            <p>
             might have a very different opinion from the member for Maribyrnong when it comes to these very important issues. It is very telling that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the guts or the ability to bring his members into line.
            </p>
            <p>
             But if people are saying to themselves, 'I don't understand what this Leader of the Opposition stands for; I don't understand whether he believes in A or B,' you only have to look at his history; you only have to have a look at his background to know that, when he was a union leader, he said one thing to workers and something very different—in fact, the complete opposite—to bosses. He was involved in deals which ripped workers off and, at the same time, he was telling workers that he was doing the right thing for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he was a minister in the Gillard government, what did he do as employment minister? He went on national

              TV
             </a>
             and radio and said he was fighting for Australian workers. What happened? He was bringing in 457 workers, foreign workers, to fill those Australian jobs, and in record numbers! That is what this Leader of the Opposition did. He has ripped off and betrayed every person in his public adult life, and this is the latest demonstration of a core sign of this Leader of the Opposition's character. He needs to state his position. Is he in favour of the citizenship changes or is he not?
