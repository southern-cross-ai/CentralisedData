        I've spoken here about before the promising breakthroughs in both treatment and prevention of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        and my support for World
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        Day, raising awareness for those who suffer from this disease, as well as those who've tragically passed away. Today, I can advise that an all important anti-HIV medicine, called PrEP, is about to be listed on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        . I congratulate the Minister for Health for this important announcement. I'm very pleased that this government is investing further in the community's health by listing PrEP on the PBS from the end of this weekâ€”that's from 1 April 2018. Without the government acting, it would have cost someone about $2,500 per year for this medicine, clearly out of the reach of many Australians. However, the listing means that the government will pay the majority of the cost, so that people will only have to pay about $39 per script or $19 if they've got a concession card.
       </p>
       <p>
        The PrEP treatment is a once-daily antiretroviral medicine, and it works by reducing the risk of HIV infection. It's not a cure. It's preventative, and people will need a prescription from their doctor. Taken and used in conjunction with other protections, PrEP has proven itself in clinical trials to be highly effective at preventing HIV transmission without any significant known side effects.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, listing PrEP on the PBS isn't the final step if we are to achieve the Australian government's goal of ending Australian HIV transmission. It will be critical that we make sure everyone who needs PrEP is aware of it, is aware its benefits and can access it. We'll need effective on-the-ground coordination and targeted communications to raise awareness of PrEP's potential, especially for the population groups most at risk. We'll also need good information and resources to support the clinical workforce, following the listing date of 1 April, and the involvement of all the state and territory health departments. This will save lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to again pay tribute to the Queensland AIDS Council and all of the local community groups, health groups and practitioners across Brisbane and, indeed, right across Australia whose efforts continue to do so much for those who are managing their own chronic conditions on a day-to-day basis. Its important that these community groups are deeply involved and engaged in the communications strategy and efforts to raise the community awareness that will need to occur from now.
       </p>
       <p>
        The past few decades have seen significant and important progress in tackling the HIV epidemic through prevention and treatment, both around the world and here in Australia. We look forward to the day when HIV has been eliminated in Australia. The investment by this government, by listing PrEP on the PBS, is bringing that day one step closer.
