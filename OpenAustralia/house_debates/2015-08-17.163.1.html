        As we stood in the pre-dawn light, the moisture from our breath condensing in the air, someone announced that the Queanbeyan temperature had risen to zero. We were in a park with a group known as the Deadly Runners. Formed by Georgia Gleeson last year, the goal was to build fitness and pride in the local Indigenous community, with the goal of running the five-kilometre Mother's Day Classic. All 10 Deadly Runners successfully completed the run. Later that year Georgia again offered a similar program. At the start of the program, some participants could not run for more than a couple of minutes; by the end, all of them successfully completed the five-kilometre Tuggeranong parkrun.
       </p>
       <p>
        Georgia's inspiration came from her participation in Rob de Castella's Indigenous Marathon Project. The project gives young Indigenous men and women the opportunity to unearth their own sense of self worth and pride by completing a marathon. The participants also complete a Certificate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
         IV
        </a>
        in Leisure and Health to educate and motivate the community on the benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle. The IMP helped change Georgia's life, from being what she describes as an unfit smoker to competing in the 2013
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Marathon" rel="nofollow">
         New York City Marathon

        . I was struck by the sense of fun that Georgia creates in her morning running group and her ability to use running to help build a more connected community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Georgia has also helped shape my running career, encouraging me to become a supporter of the Indigenous Marathon Project. Having run the

        in July to raise funds for the Indigenous Marathon Project, I will be joining other members of the Indigenous Marathon Project squad to compete in this year's New York marathon. That squad includes

        , Aaron West, John Leha, Alicia Sabatino, Harriet David, Jaeme Bird, Jacinta Gurruwiwi, Eileen Beyers and Jessica Lovett-Murray. It is an inspiration to be working with these members, the IMP squad, each of whose stories of hard work are truly inspirational.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Indigenous Marathon Project was established in 2009 by Rob de Castella, founded to provide four remote Indigenous men—Charlie Maher, Caleb Hart,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Davies" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        indicated the benefits the initiative provided to the community. It gives young Indigenous men and women from 18 to 30 the opportunity to unearth their own sense of self-worth and pride by completing a full marathon. These skills are then used to assist community members, so it is not just the individual that runs the marathon but also their whole community who benefit from the Indigenous Marathon Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last five years, IMP has successfully graduated 43 Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        men and women, with 11 more enrolled in this year's project. Running is accessible to everyone, and it is hard work for everyone. The Deadly Fun Runs organised around Australia encourage local communities to lead active lifestyles and reduce the incidence of disease and social dysfunction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Indigenous Marathon Project is part of the Indigenous Marathon Foundation, a health promotion charity that changes lives through running and celebrates and showcases incredible Indigenous achievement and resilience. Rob de Castella is somebody whose hard work is inspirational for so many Australians. I remember as a child watching him running in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        and being awestruck by his winning times in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon" rel="nofollow">
         Boston Marathon
        </a>
        . The notion of running a marathon in 2:07 is well beyond my wildest dreams, but Rob has been a great help and personal inspiration to me in my own running career. I know also some members of this House have their own marathon backgrounds behind them—not just the Prime Minister but the Chief Opposition Whip and the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">

       <p>
        This Father's Day, 6 September, the Indigenous Marathon Foundation will launch a major community fundraiser in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Centennial Park

        , Sydney, and simultaneously in about a dozen other communities across Australia. Called the Indigenous Marathon Foundation Father's Day WARRIOR Fun Run, it will seek to promote, highlight and celebrate what it is to be a noble warrior, a good man and a great father. It is being hosted in partnership with Shane Phillips's Redfern-based Tribal

          I second the motion. I thank the member for Fraser for introducing this motion into the House. Unlike the member for Fraser I have absolutely no ability at all on the running track. Indeed, the last run I went in was a 10-kilometre run around the Dubbo zoo, and at one stage some misguided child tried to feed me peanuts, thinking that I was one of the elephants. But I am pleased to speak on the Indigenous Marathon Project. I actually have found out a little bit more about this in recent times, because the member for Fraser mentioned the original runners in Rob de Castella's project that went to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
           New York
          </a>
          , and one of those is Charlie Maher. Charlie Maher is now the director for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clontarf_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
           Clontarf Foundation
          </a>
          South Dubbo campus and is doing a wonderful job with the young boys with the Clontarf program. Indeed, I was chatting with Charlie only a couple of weeks ago, when I was up at South Dubbo at the academy, and he was telling me what was happening with the boys in Dubbo and a little bit about the run that he has just come back from, where he has run in the marathon in Japan. Charlie grew up in a settlement a couple of hundred kilometres out of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
           Alice Springs
          </a>
          , from—he will tell you himself—pretty disadvantaged circumstances. With a combination of the Clontarf Foundation and the hand-up given by Rob de Castella, Charlie is now using the skills that he has, and the great way that he is held within the community, to mentor younger men and doing much the same.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another young Dubbo resident, Nathan Riley, ran in last year's
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Marathon" rel="nofollow">
           New York City Marathon
          </a>
          . He ran the fastest time of the team there, and I think it was the coldest New York City Marathon for some time. Nathan is a wonderful role model. Since he has been back from New York, he has held two
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMP" rel="nofollow">
           IMP
          </a>
          Deadly Fun Runs, and in the last one he had over 91 boys involved in the Deadly Fun Run. As little as a couple of weeks ago, while the tryouts were being held at Barden Park in Dubbo for the team for next year's marathon, Nathan was once again there running with the boys, encouraging them to participate.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a project that has come from harnessing what many of these young men and women have as a natural ability to run; they just have not had the circumstances and the ability to compete. I can remember Rob de Castella speaking about one of his original runners from Maningrida. One of the problems in training at Maningrida was that every time you were in the tanks at Maningrida and broke into a run you would end up with a pack of dogs hot on your heels. So it was very difficult for that person to train in his home town, so coming away and training with Rob de Castella was certainly a great benefit to him.
         </p>
         <p>
          This project uses running to change lives. The core running squad push their physical and mental boundaries to a whole new level, and after crossing the finishing line of the biggest marathon in the world they know that they can achieve anything. These runners are trained to become healthy lifestyle leaders by completing a Certificate
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
           IV
          </a>
          in Leisure and Health, with a focus on Indigenous healthy lifestyle. The qualification is used to promote community-based health and exercise initiatives, including the Deadly Fun Run series. Runners become role models within their communities and are leaders in the promotion of health and physical exercise to address the high incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and renal failure.
         </p>
         <p>
          Those two wonderful examples I have just used—Charlie Maher and Nathan Riley in Dubbo—are doing exactly that. As someone who represents a lot of Aboriginal people in this place, it is great to be able to speak about something that actually makes a difference and works. I have heard various speeches made in this chamber—some as recently as last week—of a great political nature, and quite often the best results are the ones that do not come from large, grand schemes but just involve someone like Rob de Castella rolling up his sleeves, seeing a need and applying himself to it, and young men like Charlie Maher and Nathan Riley stepping up to the plate, overcoming the disadvantage of their youth and becoming community leaders.

          <p>
           It is a pleasure to rise today and to add my support to the motion before the House brought forward by the member for Fraser. While in nature and name the Indigenous Marathon Project is a sport program, as we have already heard, in reality it is so much more. It is a program of social change. It deserves recognition in this place and more broadly as a vehicle of change for hundreds if not thousands of Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike.
          </p>
          <p>
           As noted in the terms of the motion, the project was established in 2010 as a vehicle to promote healthy lifestyles in Indigenous communities, creating Indigenous role models and inspiring Indigenous people. To be successful, the program needed a determined leader and role model, and in Rob de Castella it has both. Rob is widely remembered for his surge to victory in the 1982
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
            Commonwealth Games

           marathon on the streets of Brisbane and his world record marathon run that led to him being acknowledged as Australian of the Year in 1983. But in my eyes, and in the eyes of many, his true legacy will be for

           .

           Since its inception, 43 Aboriginal and

           er men and women have graduated from the program, with another 11 enrolled in this year's program. In simple terms, 54 individuals benefiting from the program is impressive. However, the number of those who truly gain is far greater. Young Indigenous men and women participants are given the opportunity to unearth, as we have seen, their own sense of self-worth and pride and get to complete a full 42.2-kilometre marathon while also completing a number of vocational training courses during the year of the program. Participants train mostly in their own communities during the program, and graduates often establish their own running and walking groups, as we have heard, called appropriately the Deadly Fun Runs. The Deadly Fun Runs encourage local communities to lead active lifestyles, help reduce the incidence of disease and also improve and strengthen community and social cohesion.

           My community of Newcastle has its own graduate of the program and is home to two of the program's respected ambassadors. One, Novocastrian Nat Heath, is a 2012 program graduate. Nat applied for the program as an opportunity to improve his own education and his health following an earlier diagnosis of the paralysing Guillain‐Barre syndrome, and also to promote health and wellbeing in his community, doing so through the Newcastle parkrun series.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nat travelled to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
            New York
           </a>
           to complete the 2012

            New York Marathon
           </a>
           , but the marathon was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy. Despite the disappointment of not being able to run in the New York Marathon, Nat continued his training and in February 2013 finished the

           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Since 2013 he has continued his training, becoming the fastest ever

           graduate, breaking the three-hour mark at the 2014 Sydney Marathon and, eight months later, winning his age category at the Port Macquarie Iron Man, qualifying him for the world championships.
          </p>
          <p>
           Taking part in the program also provided Nat with greater self-belief and self-confidence to pursue his career. After completing the program he stepped out of his comfort zone to relocate from Newcastle to Sydney to work as a program manager for the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our city's program ambassadors, Dave 'Robbo' Robertson and Paralympian Kurt Fearnley, contribute in their own ways to assist program participants. Robbo mentors athletes, hosts functions and livestreams international events. Kurt meets with athletes in their final race preparation, in New York and Boston, where he also competes in the marathons and joins them in celebrating their achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both ambassadors have also been involved in the Newcastle Hunter Runners Ball, which raises much-needed funds for the program. I look forward to joining with the Newcastle running community at this year's ball, on Saturday night in

           . Tickets were sold out weeks ago, so keen is my community to support this program. I commend the member for Fraser for bringing the Indigenous Marathon Project to the attention of the House, and I congratulate all organisers and program co-founder Robert de Castella for improving health and social welfare in Indigenous communities across Australia, including in my electorate of Newcastle.

           <p>
            Madam Deputy Speaker, if you need a ticket for that special event, which has been sold out, just go see the member for Newcastle! I am sure there is a way in! It gives me great pleasure to be able to speak in this debate. I, too, thank the member for Fraser, who himself is an avid runner and has no doubt had some tutoring from the great Rob de Castella.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Rob first came to me with this idea—it was when I was Minister for Indigenous Health, in the previous government—I sort of wondered whether or not it was going to work, not because I doubted his dedication, but because the need to be able to mobilise young Australians who hitherto had not been engaged with running, and then have them compete in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
             New York
            </a>
            Marathon, which was the goal, seemed a little far-stretched. But it turned out to be a magnificent objective—a really good goal that now has been achieved by so many.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to thank Rob. He has a very good awareness, as you would expect, about the importance of athletics, not only in terms of changing people's lives, in terms of their own self-motivation, but how it can actually change the lives of others around them. I can testify to this, because I know personally of a handful of runners who have run in the marathon project and are graduates of the program. In the first instance I am speaking of Charlie Maher. Charlie is an Aboriginal bloke from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
             Alice Springs
            </a>
            , who was, I think, in the first group of runners in the first year to do the project and actually compete in New York. Charlie is a young person, a family man, and a very good all-round sportsman—a great footballer—who turned out to be a very good runner. Not only does he do running, but because he was involved in this program, and because of his other roles, he is now a really strong mentor and leader.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is true of others who have participated. I know of Caleb Hart and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Smith" rel="nofollow">
             Reggie Smith
            </a>
            , both from the local primary school—not the one that I went to, sadly, otherwise they would be down here at St Benedict's—where my partner, Elizabeth, is the deputy principal. They competed and they have done this very hard and arduous thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the weekend of 18 July, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMP" rel="nofollow">
             IMP
            </a>
            ran a 10-kay anniversary run around the base of Uluru. This is to mark the 30th anniversary of the handing back of the rock. But regularly there is an event. An Uluru run is an annual event as part of the Deadly Fun Run series, which is part of this all-encompassing process that Rob de Castella has formulated about getting people running in the bush—and it works.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know my time is limited, but before I conclude I would like to table—and I have sought the agreement of the government representative opposite—a list of all the runners over 2012, 2013 and 2014 who are successful graduates of the de Castella marathon project program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Leave granted.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to mention two other runners in particular: Allirra Braun, whose family is very close to me, and Adrian Dodson-Shaw. Adrian is the son of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Dodson" rel="nofollow">
             Patrick Dodson
            </a>
            , who is an eminent Australian in his own right, and Barb Shaw, who is a very eminent woman and a very strong leader in her own community. Adrian has now competed in the marathon project. You see him on social media, and he is always now talking about the importance of health and leadership and engaging in leadership projects in his own community. He ran the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole" rel="nofollow">
             North Pole
            </a>
            program quite recently and, unfortunately, today he is laid up with an injury, I am told. But we hope to get him back running very shortly—although Broome is a great environment and I do not think he will have any problem getting motivated.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what we need to appreciate here is that these young people—all those who have participated—are now seen as role models in their communities and are encouraging others by their very performance to be involved in changing their lives to become healthier and live a more holistic life in terms of their own families and their own communities. This would not have happened without the foresight of Rob de Castella, who needs to be recognised and applauded for what he has done for these young people and for all of us by doing it.

             I have to thank the member for Fraser for bringing this important motion to the House, and we should celebrate the member for Lingiari's role in encouraging Rob de Castella to start or continue this great project. I suppose it would have seemed a bit ambitious at first, but it has proven to be a really realistic thing to do and one that brings great support in the community. And so we have to thank Rob de Castella for that and, in my own community, Jo Weaver, who has for some time now organised a community event at the Granite Creek tavern; this year it will be on Saturday, 10 October. So, if anybody wants to get along to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
              Barossa Valley
             </a>
             and get along to the Granite Creek pub, which is my local and puts on a good meal, you will get to hear from Rob de Castella. I will be there, my wife will be there and various other speakers will be there as well. The next morning, in the community out at Marananga, there is a fun run between Whistler Wines and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppeltsfield_Winery" rel="nofollow">
              Seppeltsfield Winery
             </a>
             . So it is a great day and a great event which obviously helps to raise money for the runners to go to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
              New York
             </a>
             marathon.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I spoke to Jo, she was very keen for me to mention everybody but her, and that speaks to her modesty. But I think so many people who are organising these events do it because they think it is a really great thing to do, and not just to recognise Indigenous people in our own community—and I think that is important. I was reflecting that when I was at high school there was no Welcome to Country; there was no event like this in the local community, and I think we were poorer for it. In fact, I know we were poorer for it. So we really should celebrate people like Jo who get the rest of us involved, both raising money and running in the fun run on the Sunday morning.

             It is a terrific event, as I said before. Last year, I had the 'pleasure' of doing that 5.5-kilometre run. It was rather warm in the Barossa Valley and there are quite a lot of hills between Marananga and Seppeltsfield. If that is a fun run, I would hate to see one that was serious, because at every stop not only was there water but there were people who put you through a range of other fitness training—medicine balls, ropes to throw around, jumping up and down, doing squats and all the rest of it. It was 'fun', but it put some of us through our paces. After the first stop, my wife said, 'You're holding me back,' and sprinted away. She came in, I think, first amongst the fun run participants—if you exclude all the IMP graduates—and shared a great time. She is something of a runner. So this year I am going to try and do a bit better on the hills between Marananga and Seppeltsfield. There are great wineries. I would recommend them both to you if you are ever in the Barossa Valley, Deputy Speaker. But, most importantly, we will be there raising money and afterwards there is a fun day for all the community. These are great projects and they help to raise money for what are worthy projects. They do not just keep Indigenous people fit but they keep the rest of the community fit as well. They bring us together in a good way that is really about reaching a true and lasting reconciliation with Indigenous people in this country.
