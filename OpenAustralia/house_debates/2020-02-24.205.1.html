        I rise to congratulate Mr Barry Dobson on receiving the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his invaluable service to the community. Barry is a retired builder from the great suburb of Inala and he was nominated by his sister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Thompson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , after a lifetime spent volunteering as a athletics official. Barry has always been a keen marathon runner and, whilst he pursued his dreams on the field, he also dedicated much of his spare time in a voluntary capacity assisting in roles as a track umpire and timekeeper, coach and numerous club positions to help others pursue their sporting dreams. How lucky we are that Barry and Irene chose to call our community home. I am very proud to thank Barry on behalf of the community for his passion and drive that he's shown both on and off the field. Being awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        is no small thing and not only is this a great personal achievement for Barry, it is a great reflection of a talent that we have in our mighty community if Inala. Well done, Barry.

        I would like to bring to the attention of the House another living treasure in our suburbs Mrs Dallas Hayden AM for her Australia Day Award for her significant contribution to the Australian community. Mrs Hayden is a much-loved figure in the Oxley community and of course is the wife of former Governor-General
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hayden" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Hayden
        </a>
        . I note the Haydens will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this year. Mrs Hayden is still widely regarded when I visit the community, with people reminding me of her great work when she was married to Bill Hayden, when he was the federal member for Oxley. I congratulate Mrs Hayden for all of her achievements and particularly for her Order of Australia.
