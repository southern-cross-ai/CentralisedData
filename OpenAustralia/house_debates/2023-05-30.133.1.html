        Late last month I had the honour of hosting the 12th annual Coral
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLean" rel="nofollow">
         McLean
        </a>
        Awards in our community, dedicated to the memory of the late Coral McLean. I set the awards up as the member for Chifley as a way to reflect and celebrate the selfless contributions of women in neighbourhoods across the Chifley electorate, improving the quality of the lives of so many people. Coral McLean was the director of the Holy Family Education Centre in Emerton, and she helped establish the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Druitt" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Druitt
        </a>
        and Area Community Legal Centre. She was also one of the founding members of the Mount Druitt reconciliation group helping pioneer the annual Reconciliation Walkâ€”I certainly look forward to participating in that walk this Saturday in Mount Druitt. Coral unfortunately passed away in 2011, but the legacy she left is enormous, and it seems fitting for us to be able to recognise, based on her memory, the contributions of others who walk in her footsteps.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to extend a huge congratulations to all the nominees for their tireless efforts. They have certainly not gone unnoticed, and we recognise them on the day. Congratulations to Samara Al-Fatlawi, who was awarded the Coral McLean Award for her dedicated volunteer work at the Mount Druitt Ethnic Communities Agency. Well done also to Jasmine Weeks, who received the Chifley Woman of the Year for her mums and bubs playgroup at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        Mount Druitt. Finally, well done to Sophia Stratikopolous, awarded the Chifley Young Woman of the Year for her youth engagement work at Street University in Mount Druitt.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the morning, we were also joined by Anthea Pearson and Nicole Thomas, Coral's daughters. We were delighted they were both there to hear from special guest speaker Justine Perkins, who's the founder of Touched by Olivia, a not-for-profit organisation that's working to create more-inclusive play spaces and programs for kids across the country. I also thank the judging panel of Bec Reidy, Ivanka Pelikan, Thelma Vuki and Aaliyah Filipe from Street University Mount Druitt. Thanks to all those amazing women for their great work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overnight we received great news that two Chifley College students have been recognised for their skills. Sienna Gardner and Brody Ball were announced as recipients of a Public Education Foundation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Schools scholarship. They were awarded certificates at a ceremony at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Town_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Town Hall
        </a>
        last night. Sienna and Brody have been recognised as high-achieving students; in fact, they've been described as exceptional. I thought that I would put on the record our enormous pride for their work. It's always important to recognise students in the Mount Druitt area who are doing well. We wish them all the very best in their future careers.
