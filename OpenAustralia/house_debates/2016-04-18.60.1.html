       <p>
        Last Wednesday I was fortunate to attend the annual Rotary police awards at the Prince Henry Centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Little Bay
        </a>
        in our community. Now in their sixth year, the awards continue to provide a great opportunity to recognise and thank our local police officers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Botany Bay
        </a>
        and Eastern Beaches local area commands for their heroism and outstanding commitment to our community. This year's event was again a great success, with approximately 180 police officers, including 36 finalists in various categories, Rotarians and community leaders in attendance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to extend on behalf of our community congratulations to Sergeant Natalie Howard-Tarn from Eastern Beaches command and Sergeant Nicole Roache from Botany Bay command for being named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Police Officer
        </a>
        of the Year for their respective commands. It was wonderful to see two women being awarded the top accolades on the evening. That was a great reflection of the number of women who were nominated in various categories and received awards in other areas. I would also like to acknowledge Community Officers of the Year, Constable Andrew Carter from Eastern Beaches and Senior Constable Stephen Lamberth from Botany Bay.
       </p>
       <p>
        A big thank you to the event sponsors,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randwick_City" rel="nofollow">
         Randwick City
        </a>
        and Botany Bay councils, as well as Royal Randwick Shopping Centre, The Juniors, our community newspaper the
        <i>
         Southern Courier
        </i>
        and, of course, the tremendous local Rotarians for making this fantastic event possible and for the wonderful work that Rotary do in supporting our community.
