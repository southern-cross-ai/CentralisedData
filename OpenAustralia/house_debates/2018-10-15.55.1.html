        In Brisbane on Wednesday I attended a special and, at times, emotional community fundraising lunch for a group known as the 42 for 42. That name stands for the 41 soldiers killed in Afghanistan, with the 42nd representing those who returned with injuries and mental illness, and those we have lost and continue to lose to suicide.

        It's a group founded by ex-Army veterans aiming to help struggling veterans and their families by building a memorial dedicated to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. The proposed memorial garden is to be located in an iconic Brisbane location: next to

        , in the memorial reserve next to the Milton Christ Church. The purpose of last week's event was to help to raise awareness and funds for the memorial. I was very pleased that Minister Greg Hunt was able to join us there, especially given that it coincided with
