       <p>
        by leave—This year marks 110 years since the first Commonwealth parliament created the office of Auditor-General as an independent public official with wide powers of investigation to scrutinise Commonwealth administration and provide independent, impartial assessments on the state of the public accounts. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        is unique amongst the broader auditing fraternity in that it has an explicit mandate with wide-ranging powers to undertake its duties, including the power to take evidence under oath. The Audit Act 1901 was the fourth piece of legislation passed by the parliament. It followed the passage of the two supply acts and the Acts Interpretation Act. Thus, the office had its genesis in the earliest days of Federation with the Treasurer of the day, Sir George Turner, introducing the Audit Bill into the House of Representatives on 5 July 1901. He described it as a bill the legislature needed to enact in order that the work of the government may be properly carried out. This sentiment still holds true 110 years later.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a government minister, I can confirm that occasionally the government incurs some short-term discomfort following the tabling of an audit report. But I have seen the longer-term benefits that flow from the improvements made by government and public sector entities in the light of audit reports. The government and the parliament are very supportive of the work done by the ANAO in highlighting areas where agencies, and at times governments, can do better, and, importantly, in identifying the critical factors for success.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this is a chance to reflect on the ANAO's rich history, it is also an opportunity to look forward. The Auditor-General's role is unique and the audit work undertaken by the ANAO forms an important link in the accountability chain from the public sector to the parliament and, ultimately, to the Australian community. The ANAO is well positioned to continue the valuable service it provides to the parliament. Auditors-General cannot do their job without the professionalism and support of the ANAO staff. Their work is indispensible for the parliament. I offer my congratulations to the ANAO on the achievement of its 110th year anniversary.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity record my regret at the death on 18 May 2011 of John Casey Taylor, former Auditor-General for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        from 12 May 1988 to January 1995, and place on record my appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tender my sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         John Taylor

        started his Public Service career in 1953 with the Postmaster-General's Department. This was the starting point for many Public Service careers in that era. John went on to spend all his working life in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Public Service
        </a>
        . John served in a succession of appointments in the then Public Service Board, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        where, as a divisional head, he was a member of a Whitlam government committee headed by the Chair of the Tariff Board, Alf Rattigan, which recommended an across-the-board tariff reduction of 25 per cent. This, at the time, was controversial, but it was accepted by the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        John held a number of influential Public Service positions including Commissioner of the Public Service Board, 1974-1981; the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, 1981-1984; and the Australian Consul-General in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        , 1984-1988. His career culminated in his being appointed the twelfth Auditor-General for the Commonwealth on 12 May 1988. He served as Auditor-General for seven years, retiring in January 1995 at the age of 64 years. John was awarded the Order of Australia in June 1990.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Commonwealth Auditor-General, John was seen as a champion of good government and a strong advocate for the independence of his office. He was responsible for achieving substantial changes to the Audit Office by initiating a strategic review of its operations and subsequently organising the ANAO into two business groups aligned to the two major audit deliverables produced for the parliament—performance audits and financial statement audits. The

         I would like to very much associate myself with the remarks of the

          Special Minister of State
         </a>
         . The office of the Auditor-General plays a critical role in any well-functioning democracy. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
          ANAO
         </a>
         's audit reports are compulsory reading for all of us. Quite rightly, they do give governments some discomfort and anxious moments, but that is what they are there for. They identify the problems and areas that need to be improved. It is important that governments learn from their findings and it is important that oppositions make sure that the government is aware of what the ANAO is finding about the conduct of the Public Service and the many programs that are implemented. When the government drops the ball and becomes lax in relation to guidelines, it is the taxpayers who are the poorer. Today the ANAO is very ably led by Mr Ian McPhee, who is supported by a professional, dedicated and responsive team. On behalf of the opposition I too congratulate the ANAO on the 110th anniversary since the role of the Auditor-General was established.

         I would also like to take this opportunity to express my condolences over the sad passing of

         That is a bit salient for the moment. John stayed true to that disposition to the great benefit of the Australian community.
