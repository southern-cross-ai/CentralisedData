        I recently hosted a free community barbecue in Annerley to kick off the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        Voice Week of Action, an opportunity to gage support for the Voice in Moreton and an opportunity to hear directly from the people who will decide on the referendum. Almost 100 locals turned up to Jessica Andrews Place to talk about the Voice, and there was a real buzz in the air. Thanks to all who turned up and who communicated with my office that they couldn't attend but that they do want to get involved. It was encouraging to see support throughout Moreton for the referendum.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a clear appetite from everyone who attended to become more active in the campaign. Plenty of volunteers signed up to help campaign for a 'yes' vote. I especially mention Renee, who, despite her senior years, has signed on to help. Bonjour a Renee. Mon ancienne prof de francais et habitante de Moreton. J'etais tellement hevreux de te voir au barbecue. Sorry, Jerome, for that pronunciation!
       </p>
       <p>
        The southside will be out raising awareness and advocating loudly for a 'yes' vote, and I encourage all MPs and senators to do the same. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to recognise First Nations people in this nation's Constitution, our faulty birth certificateâ€”or perhaps it's a case of updating the nation's driving licence. We don't need the glasses or blinkers anymore. We should enshrine a voice to parliament for First Nations people to have a say in things that affect the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I want to give a quick shoutout to local Yuggera elder Uncle Des Sandy, who has recently moved into a nursing home. I'll miss his guidance.
