        I rise to advise the Federation Chamber of the proposed scuttling of

        </a>
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        in the coming weeks. This is a project which has taken more than five years to come to fruition, but we are nearly there. Unfortunately, the planned scuttling this week has been delayed by the weather, but we are taking the utmost care in the sinking of this ship around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        have extended the first window until Thursday, 28 June. If the weather is not favourable, they will move to a second window, between Tuesday, 3 July, and Tuesday, 10 July. Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I know you're very passionate about our coastal regions. If you're available, the scuttling will occur approximately 22 nautical miles from Bundaberg and 25 nautical miles from Hervey Bay, in around 29 metres of water.

        I was lucky enough to attend a farewell service for the HMAS
        <i>
         Tobruk
        </i>
        this month, on 5 June. Those who attended and organised the event believe it is the first time that a ceremony of this type has been held to farewell or commemorate the service of a ship. It was organised by the HMAS
        <i>
         Anzac/Tobruk
        </i>
        Association, which is a volunteer, community based, ex-service group. Their aim is to help reduce social isolation by encouraging ex-service colleagues to get together in a safe, friendly and supportive environment with comfortable facilities. They are very passionate, they are very proud of their country and they are incredibly proud of this ship. My thanks go to President Bert Boyd and Secretary Jim Cunningham for organising the service. It was organised and run by

        I thank the people of the electorate, and I thank all of those who were involved in the work that was necessary not only to prepare the ship but also to get a commitment of funding to get the ship committed to the project, including of course the advisory group, which did a lot of the background work. In particular, I thank

        HMAS

        will begin its next life of service in just weeks. There are already hundreds of people who have registered to dive HMAS
        <i>

        </i>
        when it is available. I congratulate all of those involved, and can I say that we will treat it with the utmost respect. The prep crew wouldn't even put their names on the wall; they put them on a chalkboard to respect the ship.
