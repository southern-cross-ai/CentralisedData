       <p>
        I rise tonight to put forward a wonderful, funding proposal for this federal government—and I will also be putting it to the federal coalition for the next election—which has been suggested to me by students of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph" rel="nofollow">
         Saint Joseph
        </a>
        ’s School in Stanthorpe, in my electorate of Maranoa. Just over 20 students wrote to me to ask if the federal government could consider funding a wonderful initiative called Silver Memories. The young students had read an article in the
        <i>
         Courier-Mail
        </i>
        about a radio service which helps older people, particularly those suffering dementia, to feel a sense of peace and belonging. The article states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … musical memory can serve us long after other forms of memory have disappeared …
       </p>
       <p>
        Silver Memories is a community-service station which has no news of bad things happening in the world and no sports reports—just songs, musical and radio serials from a time when its elderly listeners were young and full of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The year 4 and 5 students of Saint Joseph’s understand the joy that music can bring. In their letter to me they wrote that each Christmas they visit the Stanthorpe Nursing Home and sing to the elderly residents. I quote from their letter:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When we walk in, all their heads are down and they are slumped in their chairs. However, shortly after we start singing, their heads are up and they have happy looks on their faces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saint Joseph’s students are requesting government funding so that the Silver Memories program can go national. I, of course, support the call for this program from these community conscious students—which is what I believe they are. I hope that this federal government—and I will certainly be putting it to the coalition should we be elected—will direct some vital funding towards this wonderful program.
