       <p>
        I would like to commend to the House the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme, which allows approved employers in the horticultural industry to recruit Pacific islanders. The Australian government recently confirmed it remained committed to the pilot scheme, which is due to run out on 30 June 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent changes were designed to make the scheme more flexible and better reflect the needs of the horticulture sector to fill unmet demand while ensuring that Pacific seasonal workers will continue to make financial benefits during their stay in Australia. I have seen the scheme working most effectively at the 2PH citrus orchard at Emerald, in the electorate of Flynn, which has been employing Pacific islanders to assist with its seasonal harvests and has found them to be keen, happy and efficient workers in an industry where Australian workers are very hard to find. Some Tongans working at 2PH escaped the recent tsunami, which devastated their villages. These workers pay their taxes in Australia. They benefit, we benefit, the growers benefit and their home countries benefit, so I would like to see this scheme continue beyond the projected pilot period ending 30 June 2012. Changes introduced to the system have meant better things for these workers, and I would like to encourage the program to continue.
