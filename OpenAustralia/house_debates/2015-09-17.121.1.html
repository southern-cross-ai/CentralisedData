        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_Phillip" rel="nofollow">
         Governor Phillip

        authorised the formation of a night watch, which consisted at the time of eight of the best-behaved convicts. In 1811,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Governor Macquarie
        </a>
        restructured the Police Force in establishing a basic system of ranks and control, and recruiting free men into the force instead of convicts.

       <p>
        Initially in rural areas, police were appointed by the local justices of the peace and became known as bench police or 'benchers'. As the colony evolved, so did the Police Force. In 1825, the Military Mounted Police were formed, following clashes between Aboriginals and settlers in the central west. This groups later disbanded and in 1850 civilian mounted police became the foundation of today's NSW Mounted Police Unit. Other specialist segments of the Police Force included the Gold Escort, following the discovery of gold, and an early version of the highway patrol was formed in 1925 and the aviation unit in 1946.

        , we are fortunate to have two outstanding local area commands. The Brisbane Water and Tuggerah Lakes local area commands cover the Dobell electorate. Superintendent Danny Sullivan of Brisbane Water
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Superintendent David Swilkes of Tuggerah Lakes LAC and their teams serve the Dobell community with utmost professionalism and integrity. Superintendent Sullivan of Brisbane Water LAC recently informed me of a sustained trend of crime reduction that is greater than the state average. Superintendent Sullivan points to community engagement as the best strategy in crime reduction across the Brisbane Water LAC. A strong partnership with the community coupled with an online presence is at the forefront of this community engagement. Justifiably, the Brisbane Water LAC is proud of their Facebook page, with the largest following of all police LAC command pages in New South Wales. This Facebook page is utilised to provide our community with a trusted source of information and is a key tool in their crime reduction approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acting Superintendent of Tuggerah Lakes LAC, Rod Peet, provided a number of examples of the excellent policing undertaken by the Tuggerah Lakes command. The focus of this command has been on crime hotspots and repeat offenders as part of an overall push to lower crime rates on the Central Coast. Acting Superintendent Peet stated, 'By channelling resources to areas where crime is highest, we are often able to make immediate impacts and crime reductions.' The contribution of Tuggerah Lakes command's focus on repeat offenders is delivering results for which our community is proud. The work being undertaken by both commands is outstanding and the entire Central Coast community is benefiting from their continued efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, we celebrate 100 years of women in policing. 'Two of our living legends' were the words used by Superintendent Sullivan to refer to Detective Senior Sergeant Vivienne Crawford and Senior Constable Corina Hassett. Both of these officers have dedicated over 35 years of service to the community and are at the front of the Brisbane Water LAC community engagement on the Central Coast. Similarly, at the Tuggerah Lakes command, Acting Superintendent Peet paid tribute to the most senior serving female police officer on the Central Coast, Inspector Chevonne Greene. I am extremely impressed with the female representation on the Central Coast Police Force and make special mention of the contribution and dedication of female officers serving in our local commands.

       <p>
        Earlier this month, I was privileged to attend the retired police day ceremony. The Brisbane Water and Tuggerah Lakes commands coordinated this highly successful event. All those present expressed their appreciation for being able to pay their respect to the men and women who have served in the Police Force. To all those who have served and are currently serving in the NSW Police Force, particularly on the Central Coast, I thank you for everything that you do.
