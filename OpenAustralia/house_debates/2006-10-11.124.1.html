       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate a number of organisations, particularly wineries, in what I believe is the greatest wine region in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        and in this country—the region of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         McLaren Vale
        </a>
        in my electorate of Kingston. The Jimmy Watson Trophy is an exceptionally prestigious award, and for the second year in a row the award for Australia’s best one-year-old red wine has gone to a wine made in McLaren Vale. The award was won by a family owned and run winery, Singleback Wines. I would like to congratulate the senior winemakers and managing director’s brothers, John and Kym Davey. I would also like to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Petrucci" rel="nofollow">
         John Petrucci
        </a>
        , who provided over 75 per cent of the grapes for the wine which won the Jimmy Watson Trophy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity also to congratulate the McLaren Vale visitor information centre, which was recently named best tourism operation in the southern region. The southern region encompasses a large area and includes many important tourist precincts. The tourism centre is an exceptional venue showcasing local wines, food, art and culture, and I am exceptionally proud of their achievement. It was certainly well deserved and the local volunteers who run the centre certainly deserve all the accolades they are receiving.
       </p>
       <p>
        The congratulations do not stop there. I must also take the opportunity to congratulate Fox Creek Wines, whose 2004 reserve shiraz was crowned the Hyatt/Advertiser wine of the year. In addition, the wine was the No. 1 choice of consumers. In closing, I congratulate Penny’s Hill Winery, which received awards for the best shiraz and the best wine of show at the 2006 Boutique Wine Awards in Sydney. Again, I am exceptionally proud to represent this amazing part of the world. Some of our wineries have now finally been widely recognised for what I already knew: that McLaren Vale is one of the nation’s and one of the world’s premier wine regions. Again, I congratulate the worthy McLaren Vale recipients and everyone involved in the process of making these incredible wines and achieving these wonderful results.
