          I take that support from the member for Blair there, whose electorate Amberley is located in!
         </p>
         <p>
          The estimated cost of the project is $71.8 million, excluding
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
           GST
          </a>
          . The 17th Construction Squadron operates under the 6th Engineer Support Regiment, which serves as a regimental headquarters for the command and control of several Royal Australian Engineer squadrons.
         </p>
         <p>
          As part of two large projects in 2009, Defence relocated both the 6th Engineer Support Regiment and the 21st Construction Squadron to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
           RAAF
          </a>
          Base Amberley.
         </p>
         <p>
          Defence told the committee that relocating the 17th Construction Squadron will further consolidate the 6th Engineer Support Regiment and will provide opportunities to enhance the command and control of engineer units in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           South East Queensland
          </a>
          . It will also improve the overall operational and training effectiveness, and gain unit-wide efficiencies through the provision of shared services. And the committee saw some of that during our time in Queensland.
         </p>
         <p>
          The proposed work will provide purpose-built and adaptively re-used facilities that are fit for purpose, compliant and provide value for money. The scope will include offices, workshops, vehicle and equipment shelters and car parking. A fire training facility, suitable for training personnel to use the new generation of fire-fighting vehicles, will also be constructed.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee visited the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
           RAAF Base Amberley
          </a>
          and held hearings in Ipswich on the same day. Defence told the committee that their previous experience with similar relocation works would translate into considerable cost savings for this project.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayor" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          of Ipswich, the irrepressible Paul Pisasale also spoke briefly at the public hearing. He told the committee that he believes RAAF Base Amberley is enthusiastically supported by the Ipswich community—and I am sure the member for Blair would support that assertion.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee heard that Defence would take steps to ensure the continued easy flow of traffic in and around the base during the works.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost, and recommends that it proceed.
         </p>
         <p>
          In concluding, I commend this report to the House.
