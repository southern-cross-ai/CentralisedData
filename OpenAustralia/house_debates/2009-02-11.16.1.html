        That, for the sittings of 11 nd 12 February 2009, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent:

         <dt>
          (2)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          the debate being adjourned to a later hour and the matter standing referred to the Main Committee for further consideration; and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (3)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          for the remainder of these sitting, orders of the day, government business, having precedence.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion is a result of discussions between the government and the opposition, and there is a consensus that this is the appropriate way for the parliament to proceed today and tomorrow. Therefore, question time will not proceed over these two days. For the benefit of members, it is intended that at 2 pm the member for Gippsland and the member for Indi will deliver their contributions on the motion of condolence on the Victoria bushfires. Should any other member from affected electorates return to Canberra either today or tomorrow, they would be given the appropriate precedence to make a contribution in this main chamber, as—might I say on behalf of all members—the three members did in such an outstanding fashion yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the updates to the House regarding the bushfires, the member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson will update the House with regard to the impact that the floods have had on their electorates in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The Prime Minister will then update the House on the relief efforts. The Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence, who has returned from Victoria, will also update the House. The House will then resume government business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, the House has again awoken to more stories of horror from the Victorian bushfires. The official death toll has risen to 181 and the nation must brace itself for further bad news. All the experts say it is likely to rise, perhaps significantly. As we confront the biggest natural disaster in our history, it is appropriate that the House respond accordingly. May I say on behalf of the parliament that the response from across the nation has been as we would expect—overwhelming. Financial donations already stand at over $33 million and I am sure that all Australians will continue to show the nature of their character—which is, at times such as these, to dig deep to help their fellow Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government and, indeed, the parliament stand shoulder to shoulder with the affected communities in Victoria. As the Prime Minister has outlined, we have deliberately made the decision to place no cap on the Commonwealth’s contribution to the recovery and reconstruction effort. That is a position supported in a bipartisan fashion by this parliament. The government and, indeed, the parliament will be partners for the long term in the rebuilding of each of these communities. I thank very much the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Opposition for the cooperative way in which they have conducted themselves in terms of ensuring that we are able to resolve the procedural way forward in a way, I think, that all of us in this parliament would agree with. I note the email sent out by the Speaker to all members yesterday, which reflected the fact that the Australian public think also very much that this is an appropriate way to act, and I am sure the Manager of Opposition Business will support this motion.

         The opposition does support this motion and it appreciates the discussions we had with the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House this morning. I apologise to the Independents if we have not had an opportunity to consult with them, but I feel that they would be very understanding of this.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only other time that the parliament has sat for a week and not held question time was perhaps during World War

         . The gravity of this unfolding human tragedy is such that the ink is not dry in the written story of what will be one of Australia’s greatest ever tragedies. The human tragedy continues to unfold and whilst there will be many questions to be asked, and hopefully all of them will be answered, we agree that, whilst this tragedy continues to unfold, now is not the time to show anything other than absolute and total support for every effort of every person to address this continuing drama.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for

         , spoke with the Chief Opposition Whip a little earlier. As everyone knows, Fran is a stoic character, but the significance of what is happening and what is about to unfold is weighing very heavily on her. She would be here but for the fact that her community is burning, and I do not expect her to be here this week. I very much appreciate the government allowing so many of our members who are affected by these fires to have an opportunity to speak on behalf of their communities. I also think it is an important opportunity to thank Australians for the collective effort and the collective spirit that is pervading the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one sense it is sad that only at times of crisis—be it wartime, economic crisis or other crisis—do people truly recognise the real spirit of Australia. The beauty of this nation is that whenever we call for the spirit of the nation to come to the fore it comes to the fore—and in bucketloads. Therefore, with regard to the conduct of this parliament, whilst process is important, it is the spirit and the message that this parliament conveys to the people of Australia that matter at this particular moment. The democratic part of our souls that continues to burn would always wonder whether it is right that the parliament should suspend its moment to question that what is being done is right, but it is the right moment to do this—to hold back, to be measured, to be supportive and to let the Australian people know that, as one, we are saying: ‘We are there for you.’
        </p>
        <p>
         We support this motion. We thank the government for its cooperation. As the Leader of the Opposition said, let us do whatever it takes. Let no stone be unturned as we investigate all the reasons for this human tragedy. The spirit, will and support of the entire nation must be unqualified during these dark hours as the human tragedy continues to unfold.
