       <p>
        [by video link] I've recently met with concerned members of the Bangladesh Australia community in my electorate. These Australians have family in Bangladesh where there has been in recent weeks rising sectarian violence against the Hindu community. This has included the burning and smashing of Hindu temples and Hindu homes and the murder of Hindu people, including priests. Many Hindu women are afraid to leave their home, and, given that Hindu women have been abused and assaulted, it is no wonder that they are scared. The official death toll is seven people killed. However, the real number is expected to be much higher. At least 300 temples and houses have been burnt down, but, again, this is likely to be an understatement. The Bangladeshi government says that they are investigating mob related crimes by Muslim extremists, but the Hindu community fears that this is a continuance of the decades-long campaign to force Hindu Bangladeshis from their home to seek refuge in India. Indeed, there have been at least 3,600 attacks on Hindus since 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on the federal government to urge the Bangladeshi government to ensure that human rights, including the freedom of religion, are upheld and protected in their country. The victims must be supported, and the perpetrators must be brought to justice.
