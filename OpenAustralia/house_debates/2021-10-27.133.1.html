       <p>
        [by video link] Tasmania is world renowned for its natural environment. As a climate leader we stand on our own in Tasmania; we produced net zero emissions in six of the last seven years. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area covers around a fifth of our state. It protects vast tracts of pristine wilderness which harbours a wealth of outstanding natural and cultural heritage. Our clean, green and 100 per cent renewable status is a source of great pride for Tasmanians. We know that it affords us the lifestyle that is the envy of Australia and the rest of the world. Living in an isolated state, Tasmanians have a deep multigenerational connection to the regions that they live in. In many instances, this connection involves immersing themselves in the natural environment that's on their doorstep.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've always been a fierce advocate for allowing wide-ranging access to our wonderful natural resources. As long as those activities are undertaken in a safe, respectful, sustainable and culturally sensitive manner, all Tasmanians should be able to avail themselves of the island's natural environment. And everyone connects differently with nature. Personally, I have a shack down on the west coast of Tasmania and I like to escape in the four-wheel-drive or the

        . Whether it's walking, riding a mountain bike or a horse, or driving in a four-wheel-drive or on a motorbike; whether it's fishing, camping, diving or surfing, we all interact in ways that are almost as diverse as the people who live here. No interaction is more noble than the next. From our rugged coastlines and our sandy beaches to our lakes, mountain ranges, farmland and forestry regions, the broad range of activities that have taken place historically in these areas are all important. An understanding of the environment has forged long-lasting social connections and mental health comes are improved. This has been particularly important during the last couple of years as COVID has shone a light on ways to reduce stress, including getting back to nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that we're at a crucial point when it comes to accessing our natural environment. We have seen in our state over recent years an ever-increasing move to lock up large areas and tracts of Tasmania. The consequence of this has been to limit or to deny access to those who have used certain areas historically. Alarmingly, this movement is resulting in a move towards exclusion rather than inclusion. This leads me to ask the question: is this the right path?
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise that I am in a position of privilege as the federal representative for this region in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament of Australia
        </a>
        . It's a key responsibility of my role to represent the views of my constituents vigorously in this place. What I'm being told on the ground is that our communities are tired of these divisive agendas which do not represent the majority view of the position of key stakeholders—that is, the locals. Central to their concerns is being excluded from the decision-making process. I believe that government and bureaucrats continue to underestimate what can be achieved through public and stakeholder consultation and inclusion. By bringing a community together along with you, socially acceptable outcomes are achieved and compliance is all but guaranteed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have committed to continue to be a loud voice for those who wish to get off the beaten track, to get out into our beautiful wilderness regions and just have some time out. It's important to note that no-one is advocating a free-for-all approach. There needs to be a strong framework. However, the foundation of that framework needs to be environmental protection and access, not just one or the other. We must focus on how we can make this happen, rather than why we can't. Like most things in life, balance is the key. But most important is that we move together as a community in the spirit of cooperation, good faith and understanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The protection of our regions' Aboriginal Indigenous cultural areas and our unique flora and fauna is vital—we all agree on this. The discussion that we must have next is to ask how responsible recreation use coexists with that framework. Thank you.
