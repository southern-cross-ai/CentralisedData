        As in previous years, I would like to briefly deal with housekeeping arrangements for this year's budget speeches. I ask that all members note—

        <p>
         it's actually worth members listening to this—that the usual arrangements and, importantly, courtesies will apply to the Treasurer's budget speech and equally to the Leader of the Opposition's speech in reply on Thursday. As with all proceedings of the House, the member with the call is entitled to speak without interruption. In accordance with precedent, should I determine that a member be required to leave the House under standing order 94(a), the member will be advised by written note. I also say that members using the virtual platform right throughout this week, not just throughout the course of these speeches, must ensure their microphones are switched off for the duration of the speeches.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         say that any breach of this request or any interjections will be considered to be highly disorderly, and I will deal with them at another time.
        </p>
        <p>
         To those members who are remoting in, let me just say that you have a privilege to be able to do that. For members sitting here in the chamber, their microphones aren't activated unless they have the call. There were a few breaches in the last sitting fortnight. Anyone

          interjecting
         </a>
         or not following the instructions, I will deal with, because that's highly disorderly behaviour. Obviously, I ask those members and senators—and we'll have a number of members and senators seated in the galleries tonight—to ensure they're seated in their assigned seats prior to 7.30.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just to inform the House, as a courtesy, every budget speech and budget reply I often get two or three notes from members concerned that the Leader of the Opposition or the Treasurer is going over time. Can I just point out so that all members are clear: these two speeches are singled out in the standing orders as the only two speeches for which there's no time limit. The clock is on as an assistance for them; it is not on in the normal way. So I just point that out. Yes, that does mean they can go for as long as they want.

         He's not here; he's in the lock-up. I just say to members, obviously it's incumbent on members for us to ensure that both nights proceed equally smoothly for the benefit of the House and, critically, for those out there watching and listening to these important proceedings. I thank the House.

          Mr Speaker, I think everyone agrees they'll keep that news from the Treasurer!
