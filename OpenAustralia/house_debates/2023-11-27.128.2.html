       <p>
        by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the report of the inquiry into local governance on Norfolk Island, entitled
        <i>
         Restoring
        </i>
        <i>
         democracy
        </i>
        . This inquiry was referred earlier this year by the Minister for Regional Development,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        and Territories, the Hon. Kristy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McBain" rel="nofollow">
         McBain
        </a>
        . A key focus of the committee's work was local governance models and equitable revenue sources to support the Norfolk Island Regional Council. The committee's inquiry followed the suspension of the Norfolk Island Regional Council in 2021 and the introduction of administrative arrangements for a three-year period. The committee recognises the pain these changes caused the Norfolk Island community, the subsequent democratic deficit they left and the strong desire of Norfolk Islanders to have a voice in the election of their local government representatives. It is hoped that the recommendations presented in this report can restore democracy to Norfolk Island and play a part in rebuilding the relationship and trust between Norfolk Island and the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recommendations in this report present a case and potential process for the restoration of democracy through the establishment of a newly created democratically elected governing body on Norfolk Island. The committee recommends that a new bespoke model of local governance be legislated by the Australian government following thorough community consultation. This new governing body should include a mix of democratically elected members and Commonwealth appointed members. The committee has specifically recommended that the majority of members on the governing body be elected, with elected members holding the balance of power.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        appointed members will be selected via a merit based process and have expertise in public administration, and preference will be given to qualified locals where possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of particular importance to the committee is recommendation 1, which proposes the development of a preamble for inclusion in the governing legislation. The purpose of this preamble is to recognise the culture and heritage of Norfolk Island, define the nature of the relationship between Norfolk Island and Australia and set out the shared aspirations for the future of the relationship. It is important that this preamble recognises the cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity of Norfolk Island and its residents. The committee places great emphasis on the preamble and views it as an important step in renewing the relationship between Norfolk Island and the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee understands and is sympathetic to the distress caused by the removal of the preamble in the governing legislation in 2015 and the years of uncertainty to have followed. I note that the process of developing a preamble is already underway through the newly elected governance committee, and our committee will be following their work closely.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recommends that the Norfolk Island community have a say on the draft preamble to be included in the governing legislation as well as the final form of the new governing body. It is recommended that a binding, compulsory vote to approve this final governing model take place prior to the end of next year. The recommendations presented in this report will contribute to the evolving policy landscape on Norfolk Island and the ongoing discussions about governance arrangements on the island.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee acknowledges the newly formed Norfolk Island Governance Committee, which has been established to facilitate discussions with key stakeholders involved in on-island government service delivery and governance matters. It is recommending that the findings of the committee's report be referred to this governance committee for further consultation and refinement with the local community. Once the final governing body has been agreed to by the Norfolk Island community, the committee recommends that the responsibilities of the new body and the mechanism for local input into Commonwealth and state responsibilities be clearly defined.
       </p>
       <p>
        During this inquiry, the committee travelled to Norfolk Island to undertake site visits and public hearings. We were greeted with warmth and an open mind by local residents. We were able to witness firsthand the connection Norfolk Islanders have with their island and how this forms part of their unique identity and culture, distinct from mainland Australia. It is a beautiful part of the world, and the committee enjoyed our time there. I would like to sincerely thank those on Norfolk Island who engaged both respectfully and in good faith with us. The committee talked to people publicly and privately throughout the inquiry, and I hope you can all see your history, contributions and insights reflected in our report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would especially like to thank my fellow committee members for their hard work and ongoing engagement throughout the inquiry, particularly Deputy Chair Mrs Nola Marino. I want to particularly thank Mrs Marino; Mr Gosling, my Labor colleague; Senator McLachlan; and Senator Pocock, who travelled to Norfolk Island with the committee earlier in the year. I also want to thank our secretariat for their incredible work on this challenging report—Ms Fran Denny, the committee secretary; Mr James Bunce; and Ms Josephine Moa, the inquiry secretaries, for your really comprehensive work on what has been a challenging and very well done report. It is much appreciated and, without you, it would not be possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the report to the House.

        <p>
         by leave—I also want to add some very brief remarks to the work of the Joint Standing Committee on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
          National Capital
         </a>
         and External Territories in the report of the inquiry into local governance on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Norfolk Island
         </a>
         . Equally, I wanted to thank all of those who gave evidence to the inquiry for doing so. I really wanted to encourage local people on Norfolk Island to make sure that they have their say in the governing body that is to come. I want to encourage all members to do so, including those who, for various reasons, did not give evidence at the hearings themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         I well understand some of the challenges of living and working in small communities, and dealing with people who have very strong opinions and influence in communities. But I want to encourage every individual on Norfolk Island to make sure they have their say so that the bespoke model that is developed reflects all the community's views and aspirations, particularly some of the younger members of the community and those who seek to make Norfolk Island their home. I want to make sure that the same people, as well, put their hands up for the governance opportunities that will come, ongoing, on Norfolk Island, and make sure they represent their community in the way that most represents the views of the people on Norfolk Island. Equally, on the focus through the report and for those on Norfolk Island on current and alternative revenue opportunities and options: in the longer-term, these are particularly important to the generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the chair for her work with this committee and the way she's engaged with all of us as members of the committee. I thank her very sincerely for her efforts. As she has said, it has been a challenging report to do. I equally want to thank the secretariat, who have put an extraordinary amount of work into preparing this report and have done what I think is a very sound job in the preparation and presentation of the report to the parliament. And I thank you, Deputy Speaker Claydon, for this opportunity.
