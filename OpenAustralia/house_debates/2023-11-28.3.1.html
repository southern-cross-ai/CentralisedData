       <p>
        I'm pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation that participated in the 147th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Luanda in Angola from 23 to 27 October 2023. It was a great honour and privilege to lead this delegation. Travelling alongside, as part of the Australian delegation, was Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">

        , Senator Deborah

        , the member for Leichhardt, Hon.

        </a>
        , and the member for Bruce, Mr Julian Hill MP. The theme of the assembly was 'Parliamentary action for peace, justice and strong institutions'. The delegation attended the formal sessions and participated in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governing_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Governing Council
        </a>
        . Australia led meetings of the Asia-Pacific Group, and the delegation also participated in the Twelve Plus geopolitical groups, the Forum of Women Parliamentarians and the various standing committees. We also held multilateral and bilateral meetings with parliamentary delegations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Germany, Japan, Lithuania, Portugal and Ukraine.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the assembly, I contributed to the general debate on behalf of the Australian delegation and parliament on the topic of improving the representation of women, youth and minorities in parliament. I drew attention to the Australian parliament's record on gender representation. I also spoke about some of my own initiatives as chair of the Asia-Pacific Group, such as hosting webinars on youth engagement and women's participation. I spoke about Australia's efforts in building trust and confidence in public institutions, including the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. I also discussed the important work of the Parliamentary Education Office, who I worked with closely on the Parliament in Schools program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Reynolds contributed during the general debate on human trafficking, especially orphanage trafficking. Australia's draft orphanage trafficking resolution that was put forward in the last assembly was debated in the Forum of Women Parliamentarians. Debate led to agreement on two amendments, which were incorporated into the text. The full assembly later unanimously adopted the resolution, and I thank and congratulate Senator Reynolds for leading this process on behalf of the delegation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a first in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        's history, the assembly was unable to achieve the required two-thirds majority vote on a topic for discussion under the emergency item provisions, meaning that the emergency motion did not proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my final meeting as chair of the Asia-Pacific Group, we received briefings from Asia-Pacific Group members of the IPU Executive Committee, considered a report from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        Plus Three group meeting and endorsed candidates for positions on the IPU committees.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to announce to the parliament that I was elected to the Governing Council to the executive committee by declaration. I will serve a four-year term on the committeeâ€”the first time that an Australian has served on this committee for 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also attended a joint meeting of the Chairpersons of Geopolitical Groups and Presidents of Standing Committees, updating them on the activities of the Asia-Pacific Group. Senator O'Neill provided the concluding statement to the plenary on the Asia-Pacific Group, and I thank her for the address.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outgoing IPU president, Mr Duarte Pacheco, addressed the assembly, discussing matters ranging from the war in Ukraine to the impacts of climate change. The IPU also elected its 131st president, and I congratulate the Hon. Dr Tulia Ackson, Speaker of the

       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to thank those who supported the 147th assembly: firstly, the Australian high commissioner, Her Excellency Ms Tegan Brink, and Ms Justine Jones at the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
         United Arab Emirates
        </a>
        , and Ms Petra Aitken, for their assistance in Dubai; and, thirdly, the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra who provided background briefing materials, including Ms Sarah Maddison and Ms Victoria Fitzgerald, who coordinated the provision of the materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend our thanks to the Parliamentary Library, in particular to Mr Jerome Gavin and his colleagues, for providing briefing materials which were extremely helpful and informative. The delegation deeply appreciated the assistance and support of the International Parliamentary Relations Office, particularly Ms Renae Onitiri, for assistance with travel arrangements and predeparture briefings. Finally, the delegation would like to acknowledge and thank Dr Jane Thomson, the delegation secretary, and Ms Elise Williamson from the Department of the Senate. I commend the report to the House.
