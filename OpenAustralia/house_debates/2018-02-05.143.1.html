       <p>
        It's my belief that security is the precondition for prosperity. To be truly free, we must first be secure. The people of Canning are concerned about three types of security. They are concerned about national, economic and cultural security. I know this because last year I held 29 town hall meetings and spoke to 1,000 electors face-to-face about their priorities for our region. That's over 30 hours of direct conversation with electors in Canning. And their message was very clear: they want government to continue to provide essential services and keep them safe but otherwise stay out of their lives. I agree that government is most effective when its sole focus is setting the right conditions for the nation and its people to flourish. As such, my priorities as the member for Canning are: (1) ensuring Australia's security; (2) fighting for better local infrastructure, services and jobs; and (3) sticking up for Australian values.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a time of great uncertainty and division it is important that we affirm the values that make this country so great. It is right that we should celebrate our democratic traditions: the rule of law, our political institutions and our shared belief in the innate worth of all people. We must guard those values jealously. I will steadfastly oppose the political correctness that seeks to undermine our national culture, and I oppose the politics of repudiation expressed most recently in the attacks on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        . I'm not ashamed of our country, our flag or the heritage we have inherited; our task is to celebrate the common good and preserve it for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I shared these views and priorities with my constituents in the January newsletter. The response I received was unambiguous. Marguerite from Waroona wrote: 'We want to keep our Australian values and do not want to lose our identity. We must keep our country safe and keep our borders secure.' Ray from Mundijong said, 'We cannot surrender our life to political correctness.' Del from

        noted, 'Totally agree with your stand for strong infrastructure, jobs and Australian values.' And Terry and Sue from

        wrote, 'You have our backing and may your vision for a secure Australia be achieved.' Countless others in my electorate and around Australia share their sentiments. I always assure my constituents that their feedback is being heard. While those opposite have closed their ears to the masses of concerned Australians, I can say with confidence that we on this side of the House are listening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government will continue to protect our borders while at the same time welcoming people who wish to build a new life in Australia—people who want to obey our laws, respect our culture and contribute meaningfully to civil society. We will continue to strengthen our police and security agencies so that we can defeat those who would seek to undermine and harm Australians. We will scrutinise foreign investment, recognising that all Australians have a stake in the future of this country. And we will support local jobs and businesses by providing incentives for growth.
       </p>

        I wish to elaborate on that last point. 2017 ended with very good news for Canning. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Employment

        has reported that unemployment has dropped from 10.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent in Mandurah and from 10.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Murray
        </a>
        —all over a period of 12 months. The federal government has made it easier for local businesses to hire new staff through its small business tax cuts. By reducing red tape and extending the small business instant asset write-off, we are offering businesses greater financial flexibility. Service providers in the Peel region have also been working hard to help jobseekers get back on their feet. In particular, Mandurah employment facilitator Maryanne Baker, one of only five around Australia, has been invaluable. She has run job fairs and is connecting local businesses like Madora Bay Glass with jobseekers and young people like Harley, who is now a full-time apprentice working for them. Government programs such as PaTH are alleviating youth unemployment and the Stronger Transitions program will provide assistance for retrenched workers looking to jump-start their career. Clearly, there are many people in Canning hard at work to ensure our region's security and prosperity. I'm proud to work alongside them in this task.
