          My question is to the Prime Minister: The Australian people are sick of this constitutional crisis. The only way to resolve this citizenship crisis is with the cooperation of all sides of parliament. So will the Prime Minister work with the entire parliament, including Labor and the crossbench, to reach agreement on who should be referred to the High Court?

                <p>
                 'We have a strict vetting process,' he said. 'There is no cloud over any of our people.' None! 'Let's be straight here.' I assume that included all the British citizens—no cloud over them! He said:

                <p class="italic">
                 The Labor candidates have an extremely stringent vetting process and that's why that hasn't happened.

                 He said it again and again and again. But it seemed to overlook the member for Batman, didn't it? He lost his papers. Did the dog eat them? Did he leave them in the house he overlooked? If you can overlook a house, you can presumably overlook a few papers!

                <p>
                 This is where we have the Leader of the Opposition now, twisting and turning in his own incompetence and dishonesty. He has a number of members whom, we all know, knew they were—and were—

                  UK
                 </a>
                 citizens at the time they nominated. That's a fact. He also has a senator, Senator Gallagher, in exactly the same position. She has been referred by Senator Wong, in the Senate, to the High Court. But the Leader of the Opposition doesn't want to refer the people who are in exactly the same position here. Now, where is the logic?

                 I'm so glad to hear from the member for Watson! See, the member for Watson, like his leader, is all politics and no principle. They've got people who are dual citizens, and so they think that if the House is going to refer them to the High Court it should also refer some of ours who are not dual citizens. Work that out.

And the member for Bennelong did the right thing when he accepted that he couldn't establish that which he believed to be true—that he was not a dual citizen. He resigned, and his by-election is going on. That's the big difference between our side and Labor. All the cover-ups are across there.
