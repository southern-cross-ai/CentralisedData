        It is almost 100 years since General Monash's command of the new 3rd Australian Division in the Battle of Messines. I stand to add my voice to the chorus of those calling for promotion of one of our greatest Australiansâ€”
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Monash" rel="nofollow">
         Sir John Monash
        </a>
        . He was a giant of a man, part of the generation who helped forge this nation's identity in the cauldron of war. He was a man of towering intellect and a brilliant military strategist. His bravery in leadership on the battlefield earned him universal respect among his troops. Yet General Monash was denied promotion and advancement because of the anti-Semitic sentiments at the time. How unjust that a man of his courage and bravery be overlooked for a warranted position because of his religious beliefs. Australia's early welcoming of the Jewish community was in no small part due to General Monash and the longstanding and ongoing admiration that people had of this great Australian.

        General Monash's influence and contribution was not limited to his war service. He was a leading and valued public figure, working in prominent civilian positions and dedicating his time to organisations such as the
