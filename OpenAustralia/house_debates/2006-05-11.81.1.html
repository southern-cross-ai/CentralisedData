        My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House about what the government is doing to encourage recruitment into the

         I thank the member for Forde for her question and very strong commitment to Australia’s Defence Force. On Tuesday night the Treasurer announced a record increased investment in Australia’s Defence Force—$15.9 billion of additional expenditure over the next 10 years. That included a number of measures which are about not just the acquisition of new tanks, ships and aircraft but also significant initiatives to improve the recruitment of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         men and women for the regular and also the reserve forces. Further, $194 million has been committed over the next four years to provide financial incentives for the recruitment and, indeed, the retention of Defence Force personnel, particularly in 25 of the 225 areas where we have significant shortages in recruiting and retaining key people.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also going to focus increasingly on rehabilitation and invest another $17 million. Whereas previously Defence took the approach, when an injury was sustained by a soldier or sailor, of having that person discharged, increasingly we are now working on the rehabilitation of them, both physically and emotionally, and returning them to the services. In addition to that, $184 million was announced for reserves over the next four years. That will include not just an increase in the daily tax-free payment for all reserves by $10 but also health allowances of up to $2,500 a year and increased bonuses of $5,000 a year for those who basically complete each year of reserve service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Attracting men and women to the Australian Defence Force is not just about money. Money is extremely important, but it is also important that we live in a society that values service in the Australian military. I will very shortly be receiving a report which the government commissioned from Avril Henry, which will recommend to me and the government for consideration a range of reforms. It is about our making sure that the families within Defence are cared for. It is about postings. It is about a nationally consistent education system. It is also about making sure that Australian Defence Force cadets are valued in Australia. Whilst cadets represent one per cent of their age cohort, they represent 10 per cent of those who join the Australian Defence Force.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the first things the Labor Party could do, if it is serious about attracting men and women to the Australian Defence Force, is have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government, for example, have Australian Defence Force cadets in its schools. It is extremely important that we live in a society that values service in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         , the Navy and the Army as highly as if not more highly than many other occupations. It begins with leadership and, in particular, it begins in schools. I commend to all Australians, and as a parent myself, membership in the Australian Defence Force. It is a wonderful way to make a difference to our society and bring security to our world.
