       <p>
        I rise today to present a petition signed by over 1,500 constituents from the electorate of Paterson who are concerned about the current state of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucketts_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Bucketts Way
        </a>
        —one of the most significant roads in the Hunter region, connecting the rural communities of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         Raymond Terrace
        </a>
        and Gloucester, Wingham and Taree. This petition, which is over 64 pages long, refers to the urgent need for the Rudd Labor government to match a coalition multimillion dollar pledge if re-elected to develop passing lanes along the Bucketts Way or risk needlessly ending the lives of countless people prematurely due to unsafe driving conditions. The coalition committed $12 million if re-elected to introduce passing lanes at various points along the Bucketts Way. These lanes would have ranged in length from 500 metres to 800 metres on both the northern and southbound lanes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst in government the coalition committed to the betterment of roads in the Paterson electorate by providing invaluable assistance and I demand that the Rudd Labor government continue to keep up this legacy and ensure the wellbeing of Paterson residents and tourists alike. The need for passing lanes along the Bucketts Way is dire. With Christmas time fast approaching it is a poignant reminder of the stress incurred by thousands of local residents who live in close proximity to the Bucketts Way and have to cope with increased congestion on their roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, most years around the holiday season there is an accident located along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        . Consequently the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTA" rel="nofollow">
         RTA
        </a>
        management plan is often to divert traffic along the Bucketts Way—a road which in its present state is essentially a country road without any passing lanes. It is not adequately equipped to handle such heavy traffic conditions safely. Bucketts Way is a major route in the Paterson electorate and requires immediate attention. The Rudd Labor government must listen to the cries of over 1,500 constituents of the Paterson electorate and fund passing lanes along the Bucketts Way to improve driver safety, ease congestion and decrease risk-taking and possible road fatalities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The constituents who have signed this petition demand that these improvements take place on the principle that if they are not met then lives will be lost needlessly on roads that are not up to standard. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        should quit wasting time pondering political point-scoring that may eventuate from injecting money into fixing the Bucketts Way and instead use that time productively to contribute funds to repairing one of the major transport arteries of the Paterson electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        People die on roads, and asking for more funding is not out of line—it is my duty as a representative of the people and I will not rest until the needs of the Paterson community are served. I present the petition to the House.
