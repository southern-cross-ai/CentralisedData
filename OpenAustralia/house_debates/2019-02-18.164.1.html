        I'd like to acknowledge a member of my community today, Rhoda Roberts, who was recently described in

          The Sydney Morning Herald
         </a>
        </i>
        as 'one of the pre-eminent Australian arts figures of her generation'. When you look at her achievements, you can understand why. She appeared many years ago in the television series

        Rhoda founded the Indigenous Arts Festival,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming" rel="nofollow">
         The Dreaming
        </a>
        , in 1997, which gave emphasis to the cultures, the languages and the art of New South Wales Aboriginal life, helping to foster, reclaim and encourage a way of life so it wouldn't be lost. In fact, Rhoda, is credited by some with coining the phrase 'Welcome to Country' and has established protocol manuals and welcomes by local custodians for the arts industry. In 2012, Rhoda joined the

This was the same year that Rhoda coordinated the lighting of the sails of the Sydney Opera House with Indigenous artworks. Her many other achievements include the Boomerang Festival at Bluesfest,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Burrow" rel="nofollow">
         Taj Burrow
        </a>
        , to nurture future surfing talent and is in its 14th year. Not only did Max score first place in the under-10 competition and third in the under-12 competition; he also landed a Billabong team membership, handed to him personally by Taj. To top it off, Max was also awarded the outstanding surfer award for the entire event. His proud parents, Mick and Katrina, his little sister, Mia, and his coach,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Duncan" rel="nofollow">
