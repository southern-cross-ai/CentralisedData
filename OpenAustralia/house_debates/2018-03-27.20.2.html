       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to Maria Ljubic, who is soon to celebrate her 30-year anniversary as a cleaner here at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Maria came to Australia from Croatia in 1970 and started cleaning at the new Parliament House on 23 April 1988. She was the first cleaner to work here. During the opening of Parliament House in 1988, Maria rolled out the red carpet and vacuumed it just prior to the Queen arriving to open the building, and her picture was subsequently in the newspaper. Maria says this is a beautiful place to work, and she loves talking to members of parliament and feels privileged to be here in the building. She really enjoys getting the place ready when dignitaries from overseas are visiting. Maria has been involved in photoshoots, interviews and the recent ABC series
        <i>
         The House
        </i>
        . It is a family affair. Maria's sister Anna started working as a cleaner at Parliament House on 3 October 1989â€”so we'll shortly be celebrating her 30th anniversary too.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that contract cleaning services at Parliament House are to be tendered in April, below their current rate of pay and with no guarantee of job security. It is a real pity that cleaners like Anna and Maria have this uncertainty hanging over their heads when we should be celebrating their amazing loyalty and the contribution they have made over 30 years here. On behalf of members in this place, I want to thank Maria for her all her work and congratulate her, her husband, Peter, and their daughter Ana on this 30-year anniversary.
