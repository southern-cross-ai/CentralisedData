       <p>
        I rise today to speak on a serious matter in our society. In the three minutes of time taken to deliver this speech, five people around the world will have taken their own lives—five in every three minutes. Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44. Almost twice as many people die from suicide in Australia than in road related transport deaths. In Australia there are seven deaths a day by suicide. For every suicide it is estimated that as many as 30 people attempt to take their own life. That is around 200 attempts per day, more than one in Australia every 10 minutes—200 people who spill so desperate and alone and that they think the only solution is to attempt take their own life, and seven people who leave behind devastated families and friends. This is the hard reality of suicide. In a world which expects so much and where the struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance is increasingly difficult, we must reach out and support those battling depression and other serious mental health conditions. Sadly, we hear and see mental health issues affecting people of all ages, backgrounds and occupations throughout our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a parent, the thought of mental illness crippling a child is devastating. At the launch of the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee I ask the participating students to identify the three major issues they wanted to address. Mental health in schools and amongst our youth was one of them. We must be conscious of the demands and pressures placed upon a youngest Australians and ensure that we are there to lend a helping hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Dobell, I have been privileged to work with many valuable local organisations that help those in need. I have attended the launch of facilities and programs aimed at helping those fighting mental health issues and struggling with the thoughts of suicide. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        community is fortunate to have a community groups such as the Central Coast Suicide Safety Network, the Iris Foundation and the Health and Wellness Centre, who together focus on providing a coordinated response to assessing, responding and referring people who are at risk of suicide to the appropriate level of care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Behind these organisations are team of dedicated and experienced mental health workers who work hand-in-hand with our community on a wide range of mental health initiatives. Resources include the Suicide Awareness Tool and Early Intervention Centre for Suicide Prevention, which assists people to obtain the support they require and provide integration into mental health support services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Technology now means that help is available in our homes and workplaces. I recently attended the launch of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANE" rel="nofollow">
         SANE
        </a>
        Online Forum, a new peer-to-peer support service and partnership with mental health organisations around Australia, providing support for people living with mental illness, their families and carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no lack of goodwill in our community or of those trying to make a difference, and we must continue to raise awareness of mental health issues to let people know that there is help available and that we are here as individuals and as communities to help you. I commend the work of everyone involved in raising awareness and offering support to those with mental health issues. I look forward to working with them towards a brighter future free from these struggles.
