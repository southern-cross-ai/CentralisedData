       <p>
        In recent months there have been some unhappy developments regarding Tibet, with the Chinese government announcing the executions of a number of Tibetans for their role in the events in Tibet last year and the subsequent crackdown. With the usual aplomb, the Chinese government sent the bill for the bullets to the families of those who were executed. China has one of the highest rates of execution in the world—at one point a few years ago exceeding 3,000 a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a more positive note, last week we saw an impressive expression of support for the Tibetan cause by the international community. On Wednesday last week the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        addressed the 5th World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet, held in Rome. Over 100 parliamentarians from 28 countries were in attendance. Although I was not able to be there my parliamentary colleague, the member for Fisher, Mr Peter Slipper was. It is very encouraging to hear that so many elected officials from around the world feel so strongly about the struggle of the Tibetan people for personal freedom and greater autonomy within Tibet. The two-day convention was held in the lower house of the Italian parliament and was organised by the Italian Parliamentary Intergroup for Tibet. President

        , the president of the lower house of the Italian parliament, welcomed and met

         His Holiness
        </a>
        the Dalai Lama in the parliament. Both President Fini and the Mayor of Rome,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Alemanno" rel="nofollow">
         Gianni Alemanno
        </a>
        , addressed the convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The object of the conference was to develop a plan of governmental action to advance Tibetan issues and secure effective government support for the process of dialogue between the Chinese leadership and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness_the_Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
         His Holiness the Dalai Lama
        </a>
        or his representatives, leading to a negotiated solution for Tibet. The solution that the Tibetans support is autonomy within a Chinese federation. They do not seek independence, as the claims of the Chinese communist leadership wrongly and remorselessly repeat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although I was not able to attend the event myself, several other members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Tibet will be meeting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama very soon, on 10 December, at the new convention centre in Melbourne. At eight o’clock on that day
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Tibet_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Tibet Council
        </a>
        will be organising a major breakfast to welcome His Holiness to Australia, and I anticipate there will be thousands of people at the new convention centre. Most importantly, the Tibetan cause is making an important outreach to the Chinese community and they will be having a felicitation with the Chinese community at 10.15 pm. I will welcome His Holiness to Australia and I think many Australian parliamentarians will too.
