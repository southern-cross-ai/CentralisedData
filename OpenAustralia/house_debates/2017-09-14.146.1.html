        Today the community of Woolgoolga or, as we affectionately call it, Woopi, have come together to paint the town yellow in recognition of R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ? Day and the very important message associated with this day. Nearly 100 people, as part of the Fluoro Friday Woopi tribe dressed in yellow this morning and formed a large human 'R U OK?' on the beach and in the ocean. Along with the many community members who were dressed in yellow, Woopi businesses got on board and dressed their shopfronts yellow as well. Key Employment, who sponsored the day,

        The open girls Alstonville High School netball team have reached great heights. Recently the team placed in the top two per cent of the state after competing against 467 teams at the state combined high schools competition. The players were Leilani Rohweder, Georgie Hampson, Charlotte Yager,

        I would like to congratulate three people in my community who were yesterday awarded Australian Bravery Decorations. Leading Senior Constable Amanda Vidler,

        during the June flood last year when they rescued two farmers who were swept down the river and forced to cling to a power pole. They were walking back through floodwaters after securing their cattle when they were swept off their feet and carried downstream by the strong current. Amanda and Paul from Coraki and John from Lismore found the two missing men at two in the morning, both close to exhaustion in fast-flowing water that was at chest height. I would also like to congratulate Mark Crawford, who received one of these prestigious awards for assisting his father, Geoff, who was caught in the floodwaters. That is a great example of the work volunteers do in our community, and I thank them.
