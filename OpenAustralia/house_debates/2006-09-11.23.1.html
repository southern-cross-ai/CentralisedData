        teams. The most recent team graduated in August after constructing and repairing boardwalks, planting 500 native species, removing weeds and improving the quality of the water along the walk.

        These dedicated young Australians are just a few of the 15,000 who have taken part in worthwhile environmental projects around the country since the Green Corps program began nine years ago. Together they have planted more than 13 million trees, fenced more than 7,000 kilometres and built or maintained walking tracks spanning more than 5,000 kilometres around the country. Green Corps programs provide a challenging and rewarding 26-week environmental training and youth development course for 17- to 20-year-olds. Volunteering to conserve their local environment, they receive accredited training in

You have made a real difference.
