        We need young men to take a stand against violence against women, and local high schools in the Hawkesbury have been stepping up. The Hawkesbury

        last Thursday to support White Ribbon and send the message that violence against women is never okay. It's the second year for the soccer gala and this time it brought together all six high schools in the Hawkesbury, which is a feat in itselfâ€”Windsor, Richmond, Hawkesbury, Colo,

        I'd like to congratulate Windsor High School on their fantastic organisation of the day and to especially mention the chefs, who were churning out the delicious pancakes and maple syrup and sausages to feed the teams and fans.
