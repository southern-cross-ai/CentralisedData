        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised that, if he were elected, he would deliver a $275 cut to electricity bills, cheaper mortgages for Australians and higher wages. Given the budget now says power prices will rise by 56 per cent, a typical mortgage now costs $1,140 more a month, and wages are falling far behind inflation, when will the government fess up and apologise for misleading Australians?

         As loath as I am to make a partisan point at question time—I normally try and rise above such matters, as honourable members know—the honourable member opposite leaves me no choice. The honourable member talks about budgets and energy price rises, and I feel obliged to remind the honourable member of the evidence of the Treasury secretary before Senate estimates this week. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The increase in prices this financial year reflects increases in the default market offers published in May by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Regulator" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Energy Regulator

         ) and associated market dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
         It says 'those published in May'—in late May, as it happens. They were meant to be published in early May, but there was an intervention by the member for Hume.

             On relevance, in question time, you've previously directed a minister to be relevant to the question where the minister has strayed and begun talking about the record of the former government. The minister here, again, is up to it, and he should be directed back to this very tightly drafted question.

               Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also recall that it mentioned the need to apologise. There are some people who need to apologise. The member for Hume originally denied hiding the price increase. This week, or last week, he did finally admit it. He told the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
                National Press Club
               </a>
               , 'I did as was recommended by the industry department and by the regulator, so it's what they wanted.' He has finally admitted doing it but he has thrown his former department under the bus, blaming the bureaucrats. I have little doubt as to why he did that. The member for Hume was minister for some time. On the day that the member for Hume became the energy minister, the price of energy in the national energy market was $92.63 per megawatt hour. On election day, his last day in office, it was $241 per megawatt hour. Talk about the need to apologise! Those opposite should apologise for 10 years of denial and delay and dysfunction. They should apologise for the dishonesty at the end as well.
