        As part of the next stage of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Freeway
        </a>
        extension northwards from Hester Avenue to Romeo Road, Lukin Drive should be extended by approximately 800 metres east from the new interchange with the Mitchell Freeway, to connect with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        . Local rural landowners, business operators and the North Wanneroo Residents Association strongly support the creation of the new east-west link between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmion_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Marmion Avenue
        </a>
        and Wanneroo Road. Their concerns have not been satisfactorily addressed as part of the community consultation process, despite them providing some very sound economic and public safety arguments in support of their case.
       </p>
       <p>
        The important east-west link will reduce congestion by providing an alternative route for commuters travelling to and from the rapidly developing coastal suburbs along Marmion Avenue and the employment zone to the east. Vehicles carrying freight and agricultural produce to markets will have additional route options without having to use the busy school precinct at Hester Avenue. If overlooked, Lukin Drive will be the only freeway interchange in Perth without an east-west connection. Currently the nearest east-west connections between Wanneroo Road and Marmion Avenue are located two kilometres south of Lukin Drive, at Hester Avenue, and three kilometres north of Lukin Drive, at Romeo Road. This translates to commuters being forced to drive the extra distance to go around each day and additional travel times for emergency vehicles responding to urgent situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental concerns could be addressed through the provision of tunnels under the road for wildlife migrating through the national park, as is currently the case at other locations within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neerabup_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Neerabup National Park
        </a>
        . In the event of bushfires or natural disasters, having Lukin Drive as a public road provides a firebreak and additional detour options for residents fleeing potentially dangerous situations. Accordingly, in the interests of public safety, I call upon Main Roads and the WA state government to investigate the inclusion of the 800-metre east-west extension of Lukin Drive to Wanneroo Road as part of the project's scope to extend the Mitchell Freeway to Romeo Road. It makes sense to build the road now rather than incurring higher costs in the future, when the intersections will have to be reconstructed.
