        I rise to speak about a great health-in-community initiative that took place in my electorate of Solomon over the weekend, the World's Greatest Shave. Many Territorians braved the clippers at public shave events across the Territory, including at The Deck Bar in Darwin city where I was joined by a team of volunteers, aptly called 'Team Wigsy Griggsy'. We had our work cut out for us, shaving, waxing, and clipping all forms of hair in the name of charity. I also had the pleasureâ€”

          Yes, I will take that interjection; I did not cut mine but I did have a very colourful wig on all weekend.

          Those who lost their locks included AFL NT CEO, Tony Frawley, and his wife, Tracey, who had beautiful long blonde hair. She had a No. 4. She thought she was going to cry, but she actually looked stunning. She has beautiful eyes and it highlighted that fact. Casuarina Police Superintendent James O'Brien and NT Thunder Commercial Operations Manager, Matt Argus, also lost their locks. An amount of $125,000 has been raised across the Northern Territory and $9 million nationally. That is a great effort.

The competition celebrates the Anzac tradition. Students are asked to write an essay or give a statement on their thinking of the Anzacs. Tamara West of
