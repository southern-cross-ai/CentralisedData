          My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's latest energy policy. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the government has not modelled its impact on business, has not modelled its impact on renewable energy jobs, has not modelled its impact on the broader economy and has not modelled its impact on households? Why should Australians believe anything that this Prime Minister says about a lousy 50c saving in people's power bills?

          <p>
           Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition stood in front of some solar panels. For a little while he was talking sense, and then a beam of sunlight struck the panel and he was transformed, not into a werewolf but into an economic fantasist. He said, 'Renewable energy is getting cheaper and will continue to do so.' He did. He said, 'It's correct to say we've been moving down the renewable energy path and we're seeing the benefits.' And then he said, 'It needs to be subsidised.' This is the bit that we're struggling to understand. His comrade in arms, defying economics, was the member for Sydney. She's even more emphatic. She said to Kieran Gilbert that renewables are becoming cheaper all the time and are already cheaper than coal. Kieran Gilbert was not asking an unreasonable question when he said, 'So why subsidise it?' Fairly obvious! She said, 'It's not about subsidies; it's about certainty.' This is the Labor Party: 'It's about certainty.' I'll tell you what the certainty is: $66 billion of costs loaded onto Australian families and Australian businesses in order to subsidise technologies that are already the cheapest alternative, according to the Labor Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           If Labor were remotely fair dinkum or consistent about this, they would welcome the level playing field our Energy Guarantee offers—the level playing field! There are two constraints in the Energy Guarantee plan recommended by the Energy Security Board. One is to keep the lights on. Most people regard that as a very high priority—not the Labor Party, obviously. We do. The other one is to ensure that you meet your Paris commitments. That's very important, too. And then you've got to do so in the least-cost manner. That's the triple bottom line. That's what the Energy Security Board has recommended—a plan to deliver. It's about time Labor started becoming consistent and principled and rational and supported the advice of the experts.

              I thank the honourable member for his question. Affordability, reliability, responsibility—that's what the Energy Guarantee delivers. That's what it delivers, and it is based on the advice of the smartest people in the industry—the regulators and the operators, assembled on the Energy Security Board by

               COAG

              , appointed by Labor governments, Liberal governments, working together. These are the experts that we have been called on to listen to for so long. That's the Energy Security Board—this is their recommendation. What does their advice say? It says that the best, most effective way to reduce power bills, improve the reliability of our energy system—which, as the member for

                So we know exactly what Labor's policies are going to result in—massive hikes in energy costs and a big drop in reliability. Blackouts, blackouts and more blackouts is what we've seen from Labor, and higher and higher bills. Energy costs doubled under the last Labor government. The Energy Security Board's advice is that we should integrate climate policy and energy policy through the market to ensure the least-cost route to deliver the lowest prices we can for Australian families. That's their advice.

                We keep on being asked for guarantees. I can guarantee that the authors of this recommendation know a lot more about energy and economics than anyone sitting opposite us today. These are the people, chaired by Kerry Schott—

                  when asked whether she would personally guarantee to the people of Australia that their energy bills will be cheaper in three years time under the Prime Minister's latest energy policy, the chair of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, said:

                 <p class="italic">
                  I don't think anybody can guarantee a price reduction.

                  When even the chair of the government's Energy Security Board can't guarantee that energy prices will fall for households, why should the Australian people believe the Prime Minister's so-called guarantee?

                     We can also guarantee that if you continue to ignore the need for dispatchable base-load power then you will get more blackouts. If you get more blackouts, you will get more volatility and then you will pay even higher prices. We know how this Labor horror movie goes. It's been playing in

                      Eddie Obeid
                     </a>
                     couldn't intimidate her and neither can any of his friends opposite. Kerry Schott is one of the finest public servants in this country. This is what she said: 'The guarantee is about providing a reliable power system and meeting the emissions targets set in the Paris Agreement. What will happen when those mechanisms are put in place is that prices are likely to come down and they're likely to keep coming down.' That is exactly the same advice that we received in the letter from the Energy Security Board—the experts that we've been called on to listen to and take advice from. What did they say? They said: 'Wholesale prices are expected to decline by 20 to 25 per cent over the same period—from 2020 to 2030—and that could lead to a reduction in residential bills in the order of $100 to $115 per annum. Compared to the clean energy target as specified in the Finkel review, this guarantee can be expected to lead to wholesale prices that are on average eight to 10 per cent lower over the 2020 to 2030 period.'

                     We've seen the Leader of the Opposition morph from a plausibly rational person to being completely irrational and saying that the cheapest energy source needs to be subsidised.

                       I thank the member for Forde for his question. He was re-elected at the last election on a platform that the Turnbull government is always doing things to drive investment and to secure the confidence of investors to invest in the jobs that are generated by that investment, the more and better paid jobs coming under this government, with some 325,000 jobs created in the last year alone. In the budget we said yes. We said yes to $75 billion in nation-building infrastructure investment to drive investment, whereas the Labor Party continue to say no. They said no to the East West Link. They said no to WestConnex. They've even said no today to the extension in southern Sydney. They've said no to their own electorates, like the shadow Treasurer did on the Western Sydney Airport being in Fairfield. They are saying no to these projects. We said yes to cutting taxes for the small and medium sized businesses—and legislated to do that—that now cover half of the Australian labour force. The Labor Party said no to cutting those taxes—they're saying no to ensuring that Australian businesses have a competitive tax rate right across the board. That's necessary because of taxes being cut in France, in the United Kingdom, in the United States and also in China, where they're looking to do the same thing.

                       In the budget we said yes to all of these initiatives to drive investment. Yesterday we said yes to providing certainty for investment in boosting energy supply through the National Energy Guarantee that will make power more affordable and more reliable and achieve our environmental commitments. Business and industry have said yes to that. Economists have said yes to that. The

                       </a>
                       has said yes to the National Energy Guarantee. What have Labor done again? Labor have said no. Labor have no plans for investment certainty. They only have a plan to say no on every single occasion, as this government works to drive investment that supports jobs, that supports certainty, that supports higher paid jobs and that supports a growing economy. What they do is look for any excuse to say no—any and every excuse. They will sink to seeking to discredit and bully even an Energy Security Board with people appointed by Labor state governments on it. We've seen them in interview after interview seeking to undermine those independently appointed members of that board—seeking to bully and intimidate like the unions whose behaviour they defend and protect in this place every single day. The recipe from those opposite is higher taxes and higher subsidies—$66 million in higher costs for Australian business and consumers, which means less investment.

                         of the Energy Security Board has accurately described the advice that she has given, which is that a consequence of having a level playing field—combining climate and energy policy and getting rid of the subsidies—is likely to result in a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in wholesale prices. I quote from the board's letter: 'Wholesale prices are expected to decline by 20 to 25 per cent per annum over the same period.' The pathetic thing about the opposition in this field today is that they have called repeatedly for us to take the advice of experts.

                            Kerry Schott is one of our nation's greatest public servants, energy experts, economists and mathematicians. What she said on

                             Lateline
                            </i>
                            is absolutely correct and what honourable members opposite know is the case. The fact of the matter is this: as she said, and as we know, there are many impacts on a household's electricity bill. Wholesale prices are one important factor. But there's also the matter of the price of fuel, which is not affected by this policy. There is the price of gas. What did Labor do to gas? They sent the price through the roof through not protecting domestic demand.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            What have we done? We've brought the price of gas down by ensuring that Australians are protected and can get the gas they need. Another big factor, too, is the cost of networks. That is not affected by the Energy Guarantee; it's a separate issue. That is being attacked by the abolition of the limited merits review, now through the parliament. The reality is, as Rod Sims said, as Kerry Schott said, as
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pierce" rel="nofollow">

                            has said, and as we all know—except those in this parallel universe of ideology and political stupidity opposite—energy prices are affected by many measures. This National Energy Guarantee will deliver lower wholesale prices than any alternative, and that's what Australians need—reliability, affordability and responsibility We have a plan. Labor's just got one whine after another.

                                The member for Kennedy will not reflect on the chair. The member for Kennedy, unlike members of the opposition, has additional time to ask a question. Special rules have been put in place to allow 45 seconds, and they were put in place principally for him. There were 45 seconds of quotes and statements without a question. This is question time, and I'm not going to be lectured by the member for Kennedy. The member for Chisholm has the call.

                                  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question and acknowledge her deep interest in and concern about the energy sector and rising power prices and the importance of taking action on a number of fronts to reduce the pressure on family electricity bills. The Turnbull government's been taking action on a number of fronts, including in reining in the power of networks, in ensuring a better deal for families from the retailers and in ensuring that Australians get access to gas before it is shipped overseas. Our announcement of the National Energy Guarantee is a credible, workable, pro-market policy that will deliver lower power prices for Australians and a more reliable system. Unlike the policies proposed by those opposite, this involves no taxes, no subsidies and no emissions trading schemes. It will see, on the basis of the advice and analysis of the Energy Security Board, savings of up to $115 per annum for an average Australian household.

                                   My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced his National Energy Guarantee. But today the Treasurer agreed that when it comes to savings on power bills the guarantee was actually a prediction. Just now the Prime Minister confirmed that his lousy 50c savings are only likely. Doesn't this make an absolute mockery of the Prime Minister's so-called guarantee?

                                    I can understand the way in which the Leader of the Opposition is squirming on this issue. I can understand his embarrassment. Having called for bipartisanship, having called for us to listen to experts, having supported the establishment of the Energy Security Board, then, when these independent experts, authorities in the field, give advice that doesn't suit him politically, he wants to attack them personally. He wants to challenge their integrity. Yesterday, he was having a go at the integrity of the Energy Security Board, muttering to himself. He was; I could hear him muttering away to himself, talking to himself. I think that may well have been the case. He will always get an attentive audience when he does that.

                                    What we have is the advice from the Energy Security Board that will deliver affordable and reliable power. What it does is ensure that the Energy Market Operator will not have to be, as it is every other weekend, intervening in the

                                    This is seen as the best chance we've had for years to achieve a bipartisan energy policy that will restore investment certainty into the market. I refer honourable members to the Energy Security Board's letter to the government—it is a public document. It says:
                                   </p>
                                   <p class="italic">
                                    Under this scheme, the wholesale price would be expected to be lower relative to today and lower compared to a certificate-based scheme.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    So they've carefully considered the recommendation of the Finkel review for a clean energy target and what they have come up with is a mechanism that works even better, that does a better job on reliability and does the same job of reducing emissions—very importantly. But, above all, because it integrates climate and energy policy, it will result in lower costs and, hence, lower prices for Australian families. Everything we are doing is aimed at bringing prices down—

                                      The member for Flynn would probably be aware of this because in the member for Flynn's seat he has a big coal-fired power station. It supports nearly 1,000 workers, amongst other things, at the Boyne Smelters. These are blue-collared jobs. And the member for Flynn is standing behind those blue-collared jobs. The member for Flynn is not embarrassed about blue-collared jobs. The member for Flynn is a pragmatist about how we keep these men and women in a job.

                                      I want to quote someone from the Labor Party who was talking about that Gladstone coal-fired power station. This member from the Labor Party said: 'Naturally, the

                                      , which is an area where power has been hardest to come by and is the most expensive in Australia.' That member for the Labor Party—a very prominent member of the Labor Party—later went on to say the only problem he had with the coal-fired power is that the advance was not a grant. Now who was that member of the Labor Party? Who could that be?

                                      I'll take the interjection. They've just said Mark Latham. No, it's a bit better than that. You might remember this bloke. He believed in coal-fired power. It was

The basketweavers now run this. So I say to the men and women of Australia: if you want to pay $66,000 million more than you have to, out of your wallet then vote for the liability which is Bill.
