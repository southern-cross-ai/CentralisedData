        My question is for the Minister for Education, representing the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is supporting Australia's tourism and trade sectors through the coronavirus pandemic?

         I thank the member for Mackellar for his question. While we've been here in question time, I received a text message:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Coronavirus Aus Gov msg: Stay home this Easter &amp; help save lives. Only leave for what you really need + exercise, work, medical &amp; care. Aus.gov.au.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is an incredibly important message for all Australians to abide by. What it means for our domestic tourism industry is that what would be a normal Easter won't be a normal Easter for them anymore. It won't be a normal Easter for those who rely on international tourism. They have seen their market absolutely devastated by this coronavirus. That is why the government has put in place JobKeeper and the jobseeker payment to provide ballast for those who operate in the tourism industry. I don't think there is any sector across this nation that has been harder hit than that tourism industry, particularly when it comes to domestic tourism. That is what underpins so many of the hotels, the motels, the restaurants and the cafes right across our great nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to those who are operating in our trade sector, we are also providing assistance. Last week the government announced the new $110 million initiative to back Australia's agriculture and fisheries sector by helping them move their high-quality produce into key markets, with return flights bringing back vital medical supplies, medicines and equipment. This is a very smart initiative and a win-win when it comes to getting our goods overseas and when it comes to bringing much-needed medical supplies back. This initiative utilised the freight capacity of Qantas and Virgin aircraft, maintaining four key routes through aviation hubs, including London,

         and Auckland.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is also the $49.8 million for Export Market Development Grants this financial year, supplementing the $60 million already committed and bringing EMDG funding to its highest level in more than 20 years, at $207.7 million. This allows exporters and tourism businesses to get additional reimbursements for costs incurred in marketing their products and services around the world. It will benefit over 200 businesses in the tourism sector alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to make sure, as best we can, that our trade and tourism industries not only survive this pandemic but come out the other side even stronger. We're committed to doing everything we can to help achieve that, and we will continue working every single minute of every single day to achieve that while this pandemic continues to impact our community.
