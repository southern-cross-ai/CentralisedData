        I have three items to update the House on. Two of them are very good news and one of them is very bad news. Firstly, in relation to good news, I know many honourable members were recently able to participate in the celebration of the Gita, one of the holiest books of Hinduism.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gita" rel="nofollow">
         The Gita
        </a>
        Mahotsav was an event which has previously been held in Canada, the United Kingdom and Mauritius. We were very pleased to be able to hold it in Australia this year. I want to thank the Speaker for receiving a delegation in Brisbane to receive the Gita on behalf of the parliament. I want to thank the member for Bean, who received the Gita here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Many honourable members were able to participate in it. I was able to participate with my friends, the state members for Parramatta, Donna Davis, and for Fairfield, David Saliba, in the Sadbhavna Yatra on the banks of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_River" rel="nofollow">
         Parramatta River
        </a>
        , which was an event on a lovely evening with many thousands of participants. The Gita, as I said, is one of the most important Hindu scripts. The dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Krishna is one that has had impact on Hindus and non-Hindus alike.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" rel="nofollow">

        called it the 'spiritual dictionary'.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Einstein
        </a>
        talked about its importance to his thinking and learnings. It is a timeless book with important teachings for Hindus and non-Hindus alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        In less-good news, I was very concerned last Friday morning to receive text messages about an attack on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPS" rel="nofollow">
         BAPS
        </a>
        Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Rosehill. It was a graffiti attack, and an attack on that Mandir and on participants in that Mandir. This is unacceptable, it's un-Australian, it's not on and we're not going to cop it. Every place of worship should be a place of peace, tolerance and understanding. On Saturday, I was able to call in between other functions to express my support for the Mandir. I'm grateful to Kunal Patel, Yogi Savania, Maitrik Thakkar and Shyam Gohil for meeting with me to discuss the issue. Dr Charlton, the member for Parramatta, was able to go—he got there before me—and assist in the removal of the graffiti. This is a terrible thing. I know all honourable members express solidarity with that community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in good news, the BAPS Hindu Mandir and Cultural Precinct at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemps_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Kemps Creek
        </a>
        is well underway. This will be the biggest Hindu temple in Australia and, I think, one of the best in the world. I know the member for Gellibrand is upset about that. I can tell you—the member for Gellibrand is not as upset as the member for Parramatta is about that fact! It will be the biggest Hindu Mandir in Australia. I'm very honoured to host it in the electorate of McMahon. It will be one of the best in the world. It's a huge site—an old farm in Kemps Creek which is being developed. I was able to visit there a couple of weeks ago and see the progress. It's great news. Congratulations to all involved.
