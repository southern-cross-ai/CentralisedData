        Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister update the House regarding recent events in Libya?

         I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. Today we are seeing more extraordinary events in Libya. We have lived through a great number in the Arab spring but there are more extraordinary events on our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         screens as the story of the Arab spring continues to unfold.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we have seen rebel forces reach Tripoli. They have reached
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Square" rel="nofollow">
          Green Square
         </a>
         . They are in the heart of the capital. There appears to be little resistance in the square itself. We have seen scenes of celebration. But we do not know the full story of what has unfolded in Tripoli. We do not know with certainty where Gaddafi is. We do not know what resistance remains. There may be more fighting ahead. But it does appear that another undemocratic regime is falling.

          Colonel Gaddafi
         </a>
         , with his family, has ruled Libya with an iron grip since 1969. As has been the subject of discussion in this parliament, he brutally took up arms against his own people earlier this year. He plunged his country into what has been a bloody civil war. Some of the things that we have seen in that civil war have rightly caused horror and outrage around the world.

         Under a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Security Council mandate, the international community acted to protect civilians from Gaddafi. His regime appears to be ending. Today is a day of relief and celebration in Libya. What that means though is tomorrow a lot of hard work begins. Australia wants for Libya a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future. We know it is in reach but it is not certain. Australia has recognised the National Transitional Council as the legitimate governing authority in Libya. We were one of the first countries to call for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          UN Security Council
         </a>
         to impose a no-fly zone. We have been at the forefront of international humanitarian assistance and in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Along with other members of the international community, we stand ready to support the work that will now be necessary in Libya: the work that will be necessary to end all violence; the work that will be necessary to bring Libya to a state of order; the work that will be necessary to develop a tolerant, inclusive, democratic society; and the work that will be necessary to breathe life back into Libya's battered economy. The work will be difficult and the path ahead is uncertain, but I am sure each of us has been very joyful to see the scenes of celebration today.
