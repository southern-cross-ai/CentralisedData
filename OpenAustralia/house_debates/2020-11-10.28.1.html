        I rise today to present to parliament petition
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EN" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        1860, on inclusion of parents as immediate family members for travel exemption. Everyone understands that putting in place international border restrictions have been and continue to be critical to our measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic. But, as I've spoken about previously in this place, we need to be very aware of the impact which border and travel restrictions are having on the mental health and wellbeing of our fellow Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are a very multicultural country. Close to 30 per cent of Australia's resident population was born overseas. A significant number of these Australians still have close family living overseas. At present, and under the COVID restrictions, the immediate family members of an Australian citizen or permanent resident are allowed to enter into Australia, and that is wonderful. However, 'immediate family' does not include parents. This is despite the fact that parents are a key part of an emotional support system for many immigrants and their families, and that many immigrant residents are also primary caregivers for their parents who reside in their native country and are not able to travel because of COVID restrictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the mental health and emotional stress this is causing, the 11,000-plus signatories to this petition are calling on the government to include parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents as immediate family members. On behalf of all signatories, I present this petition.

       <p class="italic">
        Due to the Covid-19 related travel ban, the parents of Australian citizens and Permanent residents can not travel into Australia. The immediate family of an Australian citizen or permanent resident is allowed to enter into Australia. However, parents are not considered as immediate family. Parents are a key part of an emotional support system for immigrants and their families. Some of the immigrant residents are also primary care givers of their parents who reside in their native country and are not able to care due to the travel restrictions. We know this pandemic is going to last long and not able to meet or grief or celebrate events together is causing mental and emotional stress. The separation is now having an impact on people's emotions and mental health. Other countries like

        ,

         UK
        </a>
        , Canada are allowing parents of citizens to join them in the country and spend time together during this pandemic.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to include parents of Australian citizens and Permanent residents as "immediate family members", which allows them to enter and stay in Australia as per the visa conditions. The parents should be sponsored and supported and will not a burden on the government or the community. A mandatory 14-day paid quarantine at designated facilities should be applied so to protect the health of the Australian community, but post this at-least the family will be able to spend time together.
