         Yes, my question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister state whether or not his office became aware that Senator Santoro was engaged in share trading in December last year? So the question is: can the Prime Minister state whether or not his office became aware that Senator Santoro was engaged in share trading in December last year?

          I am aware that my office, through the person of my then principal private secretary and my now chief of staff, had a discussion with his opposite number in Senator Santoro’s office regarding the categorisation of some investments which had been referred to. I know exactly what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is referring to, and she knows I know why she is referring to it. She knows exactly why and I have to assure her: forget the conspiracy; it was a very legitimate discussion about the categorisation.
         </p>
         <p>
          While I am on my feet, can I say this: Senator Santo Santoro is no longer a minister for a very simple reason. He is no longer a minister because he failed to disclose, as he was required to do, to the Senate and also to me the share investments that he made and other investments which were first brought to my attention a few days ago. That is the reason why he is out.

          take the opportunity of saying again that it is the responsibility of all of you, on all sides, to comply with the resolutions of the House. Everybody has an obligation—all members and senators have an obligation of complying with the resolutions of the two houses of parliament. Senator Santoro did not do that. That is the reason why he is no longer a member of the ministry.
