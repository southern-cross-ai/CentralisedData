       <p>
        I was pleased to announce last week funding of over half a million dollars from the Gillard government that will help deliver new cancer patient accommodation in Ballarat. That is following an agreement with the Victorian government to enhance existing cancer services and centres across regional parts of the state. Patients requiring treatment at the new Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre, and their families, will be able to stay in affordable accommodation built to support them during a very challenging time.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are few of us who have not been touched by cancer either directly or indirectly through the experiences of loved ones, family and friends. Cancer is the leading cause of death in Australia. In Victoria alone, we currently lose around 11,000 people to cancer every year. However, through early detection and treatment, survival rates have increased steadily over time, saving thousands of lives. But research has shown that survival rates for cancer patients in rural and regional areas are poorer than those in metropolitan areas, with the gap in treatment outcomes increasing in step with distance from a metropolitan area.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has been committed to fighting cancer and closing that gap in cancer outcomes between the city and the country. All Australians with cancer should have access to the right care, close to their homes and loved ones, irrespective of where they live or their social circumstances. That is why we have invested $42 million towards construction of the new $55 million Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre, which commenced treating patients just last month and will be fully operational by July. With increased capacity to treat 800 additional patients locally, this dedicated cancer treatment centre will improve the experiences and outcomes of patients by offering world-class services in Ballarat and for the wider
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_District" rel="nofollow">

        region. Some patients need to travel long distances to receive their treatment, and the new accommodation announced in Ballarat will also help to take the stress out of having to find cheap, quality accommodation close to the cancer centre and the hospital precinct. This will remove further barriers of inequity for people in regional Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreement complements the new care package, World Leading Cancer Care, announced in the 2013-14 budget, which will invest more than $226 million to detect, prevent and deliver cancer care and support services. Since 2007, this government has committed $3.5 billion for cancer detection and treatment, including a record $2 billion in the 2009-10 budget to build a world-class cancer care system for Australia. This is an important area, and I note the member for Solomon here, who has cancer treatment now in Darwin for the first time. Many people used to have to travel to Adelaide for cancer treatment. This government has made a significant commitment to improving the outcomes for regional Australians who are suffering from cancer.
