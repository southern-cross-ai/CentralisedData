        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Would the minister update the House on the rollout of the government’s

        </a>
        ? What steps has the government taken to maximise the benefits of the package for Australian households?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Brisbane for his question, knowing the great interest he takes in seeing homes in his electorate getting ceiling insulation from the government’s Energy Efficient Homes package, which has now provided roof insulation to some 289,000 Australian households and solar hot water for over 70,000 households. Critically, the estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector is around 470,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over the next year alone and over half a million tonnes if we include solar hot water. This is the largest ever rollout of energy efficiency to Australian households. It is producing jobs and it is reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well. We have some 7,300 businesses now registered to take part in the insulation program. That translates into thousands more individual installers and thousands of jobs. Let us be very clear: these jobs would not now be underway if the coalition had had their way, because they opposed these measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         We on this side of the House are committed to ensuring that there is value for money for the work that is done. I am aware that there have been reports of some issues with the rollout of the scheme. That is why I want to assure the House that I will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the compliance measures that are in place and I will not hesitate to adjust them, if required, to ensure that each and every installer of insulation around this country provides the best possible service to their customers. We are also committed to ensuring that all issues and complaints, whether from installers or households, are dealt with effectively. Part of this process means ensuring the accuracy of complaints so they can be properly followed up. I can inform the House that we have followed through on some particular issues that were raised by the opposition in question time on 19 August. The member for Hinkler referred to a company called AllSafe Energy Efficient Products, providing, he said, and I quote:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … 14 different examples of fraudulent and misleading practices by unscrupulous operators …
        </p>
        <p>
         He went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There has been no further response to—
        </p>
        <p>
         the installer’s—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         14 areas of complaint from the department or the minister’s office.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform the House that there has been further response on the issues raised by the member for Hinkler—a response in fact from the general manager of AllSafe Energy Efficient Products, sent to me on 20 August and titled ‘Incorrect statements made by the member for Hinkler in parliament on 19 August 2009’. In this letter the general manager says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We wish to preface that Mr Neville has misrepresented the nature of comments made by AllSafe Energy Efficient Products’ Bundaberg franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
         It goes on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our outlet, as a longstanding provider of insulation to the region, recently provided comment to the Bundaberg media regarding what measures consumers could take to ensure they were dealing with a reputable insulation contracting company, and as a result of the media exposure we are advised that on 18 August Mr Neville’s office representative … contacted our Bundaberg office under the guise of requesting advice on how consumers could avoid less reputable insulation contractors.
        </p>
        <p>
         He writes:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am assured that our franchisee in Bundaberg has not lodged 14 complaints regarding other insulation installers. Further to this, I would have thought that Mr Neville or his representative would have acted more responsibly and with a greater sense of fair play than to take information provided in good faith by an unauthorised office junior as the express opinion of AllSafe Energy Efficient Products.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Garrett—
        </p>
        <p>
         he says—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         to be frank, we believe that Mr Neville’s comments in parliament were political point-scoring.
        </p>
        <p>
         He goes on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If anything, we actually fear that his comments only serve to hamper your intended policy of stimulating the economy and employment.
        </p>
        <p>
         He goes on to say, in fact:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am told by our Bundaberg franchisee that his operation has employed 12 new staff as a direct result of the government’s stimulus package.
        </p>
        <p>
         These jobs would not have been available if the coalition had had their way. They have been undermining the most successful rollout of energy efficiency in our history, they are undermining the thousands of jobs that go with a rollout of ceiling insulation and they are now undermining the good reputation of insulation businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is very disappointing, but here is one more example of the opposition’s complete failure to support or comprehend the need for us to take action on climate change generally. I note what the Treasurer said when he made his remarks previously about having to stand for something, because there is the title of a song that comes to mind, and that is simply this:
         <i>
          You’ve Gotta Stand for Something or You’ll Fall for Anything
         </i>
         . You only need to read the reports in the papers today about the party room. I have to say I have some affection for the member for Bradfield’s habits and hobbies. I know he enjoys playing guitar. I know he rides a motorbike.

               Thank you, Mr Speaker. As they vacate the parliament of Australia, I make the following point. I think I recognise the significance of the member for Bradfield’s contributions generally, but you need only to read the reports of the response to the member’s speech in the coalition party room rejecting emissions trading which ‘triggered loud applause and a cascade of supportive speakers’. I have fronted a few audiences in my time, and it is very rare that you get a standing ovation for going backwards, and that is what the coalition is doing.
