       <p>
        Today I again speak about the devastating humanitarian crisis in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lanka
        </a>
        . The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Smith
        </a>
        , has called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict in north Sri Lanka, noting that military means alone will not solve this dispute. I share the minister’s view that violence is not the solution to this protracted humanitarian disaster in Sri Lanka. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have spoken about this conflict on numerous occasions in this place. Only political will and not military might will resolve this conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Lowe a large Tamil community is appalled and aggrieved at the human toll of suffering which is ever increasing. The violence that many of my constituents have been witness to is beyond comprehension and the continuation of the violence in this decades-long conflict deeply saddens everybody. The people I represent are seeking international support to resolve this terrible conflict. On this point I think it is worth recording again that the Australian government has contributed an additional $5 million in humanitarian assistance which will provide essentials such as medical supplies, water and sanitation for those civilians caught in the conflict zones. The $5 million is on top of the $4 million of food aid Australia has already offered to Sri Lanka through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Program" rel="nofollow">
         World Food Program
        </a>
        . I commend the minister for his practical assistance for the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. I am pleased that Australia has been actively involved in international efforts to assist those affected by the conflict in Sri Lanka. The assistance will be provided through various aid organisations such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        and Australian and international non-government organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The allocation of resources, however, is useless if those organisations are hindered by unsafe passage for the affected civilians. When he met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lankan
        </a>
        high commissioner in February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs clearly conveyed Australia’s position that safe access for humanitarian workers is critical and all parties must ensure that humanitarian aid is delivered frequently and safely. Further, the minister called on all parties involved in the fighting to make the protection of civilians an absolute priority. Again today I agree with the minister. Every effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties. Too many lives have been wasted; too many victims have suffered so much. A genuine ceasefire adhered to by all parties is pivotal to any successful diplomatic negotiation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again I bring this matter to the attention of the parliament on behalf of my constituents and repeat the call for cooperation among all parties to work towards an orderly coexistence which will bring lasting peace to Sri Lanka.
