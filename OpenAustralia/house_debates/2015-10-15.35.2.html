        It is with great pleasure that I rise today to wish a special happy birthday to Mary Whitehurst, who will join the ranks of Australia's supercentenarians when she turns 110 next week. For those who do not know, a supercentenarian is someone who reaches the age of at least 110 years. There have only ever been 26 people in Australia who have reached that age, and 25 of those have now passed away. With Mrs Whitehurst's milestone next week, she will be able to add another one to that list.
       </p>

        Mrs Whitehurst is an accomplished pianist living in the Riddell Gardens Aged Care Facility in Sunbury, which I visited recently. Although I did not get the chance to catch up with this wonderful lady myself, the staff told me that she continues to entertain residents every Friday afternoon at happy hour and at other times with her piano singalongs. Mrs Whitehurst has been an active member of the Sunbury community. She played the organ at the Sunbury Methodist church and was the president of the

         Riddells Creek
        </a>
        senior citizens' club for 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with wishing Mrs Whitehurst a happy birthday, I want to take this time to thank her for her service to the community and her positive approach to life. Mrs Whitehurst, you are definitely on the money when you remind us that we have to try and look at the good things in life. You go out the next day and try to do better, as there is no point whining. I wish you a very happy birthday, as I am sure every member in this House does, and I look forward to hearing you play the piano for the singalongs at the Riddell Gardens Aged Care Facility soon.
