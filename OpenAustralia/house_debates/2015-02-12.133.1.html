        I rise to speak on the Riverland and Mallee Vocational Awards, hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Berri, which I was delighted to attend on Friday last at the Berri Hotel in my electorate. The awards were developed in 1982. They have an esteemed history and they are highly regarded in my community, the state and the nation. They were developed by the Rotary Club of Renmark as a way of recognising the outstanding achievements of young apprentices in the Riverland and Mallee. In 1991, the awards expanded to recognise the growing significance of traineeships and in 2001 the awards developed even further by presenting an award to the most outstanding vocational education training student from the Riverland's many high-quality high schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year, the club celebrates the achievements of young people from the Riverland and Mallee region.

        and Mallee Vocational Awards are the largest of their kind in regional Australia, which is a fantastic achievement and underscores not only the hard work of the apprentices, trainees and students but also the dedication of the Rotary Club members and employers in the district. The awards recognise the success, endeavour and enthusiasm of young outstanding members of the Riverland and Mallee community.
