        ALLACE () (): The Local Sporting Champions program provides financial assistance for athletes aged between 12 and 18 who are participating in state, national or international competitions. Today I want to pay tribute to our most recent local sporting champions for their talent, diligence and determination. As the parents of a multiclass swimmer, Leonie and I know as well as anyone the monotony of 4 am pool drop-offs, road trips to competitions and all that comes with nurturing burgeoning athletic talent. Actually, Leonie knows it more than I do, because I'm often either here or doing something else. So in paying tribute to our champions I also pay tribute to their parents, caregivers, coaches and mentors. Thank you for the sacrifices that you've made to give our champions the chance to thrive.

        , Eva Pedrana and Abby Novosel. Congratulations to our taekwondo champions: Charlie Bidgood and Kaitlyn McNulty. Congratulations to our soccer stars: Harper Caples and Zachary Roulston. Congratulations to our water polo players: Mia Freeman, Giacomo Hernandez and Luca Batzloff. Congratulations to our triathletes: Kyle Wallace and Wade Wallace—of no relation, I'll point out there. Congratulations to our volleyballers: Jessica Lawrie and Milla Greber. I also want to pay a special tribute to 14-year-old Sienna Knowles, who has become an internet and international skateboarding sensation. Good on you, Sienna!

        I'm very proud of all of the athletes. Some of those I've just mentioned couldn't come to my office last week, but I want to say to all those young athletes, whether they were there or not: your local community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast

        is so very proud of you for the dedication and the hard work that you put in. I was telling the young people and their parents who were there that it's really important that they recognise the sacrifices their parents and their coaches make to give them every opportunity. I always make it a bit of a ritual that—it's a little bit embarrassing—they need to go and give mum and dad a bit of a hug and say thank you for their dedication and what they give up to allow their young people to excel in sport. Once again, the Sunshine Coast is so very proud of you, young athletes. Well done.
