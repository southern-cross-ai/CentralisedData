        The winter break has provided me with so many great opportunities to get out and about in my electorate and to meet and connect with so many different constituents. In late July I had the great pleasure of meeting with the very first member for Aston,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Saunderson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and his wife, Colleen, and daughter, Liz. It was great being able to hear from John about the very many different experiences he had doing this fantastic job, which he did from 1984 to 1990. John told me what it was like being part of the Hawke Labor government—and I was a very captive audience, I must say! I thank John and his family very much for their time, and John for the sound advice he shared with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, during the break I had the great privilege to attend some fantastic celebrations at

         Swiss National Day
        </a>
        along with the wonderful state member for Monbulk, Daniela De Martino. The day was organised by the Swiss Yodel Choir Matterhorn, with many terrific cultural celebrations to experience and join in with; I didn't do the yodelling so much, though! It was such a terrific turnout, with over 500 people all celebrating and supporting the event—and yummy food too, I must say. It was an honour to meet with the honorary consul of Switzerland in Melbourne, Manuela Erb, and members of the committee. I am certainly looking forward to Swiss National Day next year.

        I've also had many opportunities to hold mobile offices across the electorate, giving me an opportunity to chat with many constituents. These provide a fantastic opportunity to get out into the community, and to have great chats with people about life and any problems they may have as well. I visited Wellington Village in Rowville and my friends at Choco Bean coffee shop, which always gives me a great chance to chat with the locals.

        I also joined many early risers at Boronia and Bayswater train stations, and I was thrilled to bump into some very familiar faces as well. I ran into Steve, who I've met several times over the last couple of years now, as well as Brian, who's originally from Ohio. I first met him and his wife, Perla, last year. They'd become Australian citizens just before the by-election, and they voted for me, so I was very happy to meet them both again. The support I receive from so many lovely locals who stop to say hello and pass on their feedback is much appreciated, and I give a big thanks to those who let me know they voted for me two times. Thanks for that! I encourage all those in my electorate of Aston to pop down to Wellington Village or any of the mobile offices to have a chat about anything or for any federal government related assistance.
