       <p>
        Last night I spoke in this place about the situation in Afghanistan and the impact on the Afghan community in northern Tasmania. As always, my words in this place reflect the views my community has shared with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been heartened by the community response to the plight of those in Afghanistan and those who have had to flee. I've had many letters and emails of concern. One of those was an email from Alison Jales, a teacher from Glen Dhu Primary School. Alison's class held a special day last week to show their support for all the Hazara families at their school who have friends and families in Afghanistan. The students wore the colours of the most recent Afghan flag and learned that Afghanistan has had 33 flags in the time that Australia has had one. They created posters with messages of support. Alison's class read the story of Malala and heard about her fears for the education and safety of girls in Afghanistan under the Taliban. Included in this email were very thoughtful letters to me from students expressing their support for the right for all girls in Afghanistan to go to school and for Australia to provide support to Afghan people. I want to say to Jack, Annabel, Jackson, Dexter, Bronte, Dylan, Evelyn, Erin, Isla, George, Ollie, Noah, Arthur, Bree, two Elizas and two Ellas: please know that I have read all of your letters and that your voice is important.
