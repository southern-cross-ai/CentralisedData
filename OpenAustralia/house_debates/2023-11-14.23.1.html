       <p>
        This week marks the celebration of Seniors Week in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . I extend a shout-out to all the wonderful seniors within my electorate of Pearce. Seniors Week stands as a significant occasion to acknowledge the pivotal role that seniors hold within our community. This week helps to promote positive aging and encourages participation in community life, particularly for isolated people. I consider myself privileged to spend time with the seniors in my community and collaborate with the many wonderful people. From the indominable Marcie Dinnie, who celebrates her 25th year as President of the Wanneroo Senior Citizens Association, and her amazing committee to all of those involved in the various men's sheds and other seniors groups across Pearce, I applaud you all for your contribution in making our community great.
       </p>
       <p>
        In today's landscape, many seniors find themselves assuming diverse roles as support within their families. A noteworthy percentage even take on the role of rearing their own grandchildren. This is not without its challenges yet, despite that, there lies an abundance of joy in embracing this role in a child's life. As a grandparent, one morphs into a teacher, a playmate and a trusted confidant, becoming an embodiment of love.
       </p>
       <p>
        I reserve a special expression of gratitude for those who have willingly embraced responsibilities within the diverse community groups across the breadth of the great Pearce electorate. Your efforts do not go unnoticed. They are deeply appreciated and we absolutely applaud you. We would be lost without you. Thank you.
