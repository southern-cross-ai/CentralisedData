       <p>
        Recently many in the media have been concerned yet again about the parliament, freedom of speech and the right to know. Tonight I would like to put on the record another aspect from a parliamentary representative’s perspective. A couple of months ago the Adelaide
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        wrote a piece about MPs, including me, who were leaving the parliament at the end of their term and their participation in overseas delegations—the old perennial. I dared to offer an alternative view in the form of a letter to the editor of the
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        . The
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        declined to print that letter and I subsequently purchased advertising space on page 5 of the
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        to have my alternative view published. I was sold the space and I paid up front. Subsequently, on viewing my point of view, the
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        refused to publish it, even after accepting payment for the space, whilst at the same time offering to print my letter to the editor as a letter to the editor. So it seems that monopoly practices and freedom of speech are very much in the eye and mind of the beholder.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the power of the press is very much on display in this case with my right of reply, and the monopoly power of the Adelaide
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        is a simple fact. So the question remains: what is the reasonable balance and how can people’s representatives fight for that reasonable balance? I simply conclude by saying: it seems to me that there is a responsibility upon all parties, including those with monopoly power, to offer a fair go to maintain our standards in this country.
