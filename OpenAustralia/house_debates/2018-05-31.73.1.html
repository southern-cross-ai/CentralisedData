        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government's 10-year infrastructure investment pipeline is connecting local communities and creating local jobs in South Australia? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any risks to this plan?

         It's good to get a question about the economy. It's good to get a question from the member for Boothby. She's a true local fighter and a voice for the people. You need look no further than the member for Boothby when it comes to a good local champion and a good fighter for a local community and the economy. Like all members on this side of the chamber, she's passionate about delivering the infrastructure and jobs for her local community, for South Australia and for the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our $75 billion job-creating, economy-building 10-year investment pipeline of infrastructure will continue to strengthen our economy by connecting local communities, increasing local productivity and creating local jobs—jobs and more jobs. We've helped small and medium enterprises create one million jobs in five years—in five months less than five years, in fact. We are delivering, adding to the more than one million jobs we've created. It's all about a strong economic blueprint. Our plan is to take the pressure off household bills, off tax liabilities for workers and off small and medium family enterprises; to not rip pensioners off; to put downward pressure on the cost of living; to make it easier to grow, invest and create more jobs; and to make sure that the right infrastructure is in place.

         In South Australia the Liberal and National federal government is delivering up to $1.39 billion for the north-south corridor, adding to the $1.6 billion already invested in the project. I'll tell you who's delighted about it—not just the member for Boothby but the

         is a good man. I had a meeting with him last night. He's delighted by the investment we're making in South Australia—electrifying the Gawler rail line to cater for increased passenger numbers and duplicating the Joy Baluch Bridge in the member for Grey's electorate. There's so much more. We're rolling out $94 million for the Oaklands crossing, more than $42 million for the Flinders link and more than $1.55 million for local community infrastructure projects in the member for Boothby's electorate. There is $18½ million for the Lobethal freight access and

         We're getting on with building a better South Australia and a better future, but I'm asked about the risks. Those opposite are looking at me.

          They're doing a bit of yelling, but they are a risk to jobs. They are a risk for higher taxes and lower wages. That's what they are. They're all sitting opposite beholden to the union movement and beholden to the—
