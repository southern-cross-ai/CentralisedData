        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Will the minister update the House on how the government is growing the economy by securing export markets for the agricultural sector? And is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank the honourable member for his question and I commend the honourable member for the work he has done with our department in securing a further $1 million for Beef Week in Casino, because we know how important beef is to our economy. We have record prices in cattle at the moment. We are continuing to drive markets. In fact, even in recent days we have reopened the live cattle trade to Japan, which is also going to bring further returns to our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member would also be aware of the great work that has been done in the horticultural industry. Between our two seats there are Drake and Tabulam—the blueberry industry, employing in a season up to a thousand workers. That is actually also going to add to the economy of this nation and help deal with some of the economic issues that the Treasurer so rightly points out.
        </p>
        <p>
         We continue to work on expanding our agricultural exports, so much so that agricultural exports are now the second-biggest exports after iron ore. To go through them section by section would take vastly more time than we have here, but even if we look anecdotally at some of the smaller areas: in table grapes to Japan, we have had record exports in April at 32,587 tonnes. This market is up more than 400 per cent from where it was last year. We have the protocols through for exports of melons and pumpkins, and this continues to add to our agricultural exports.
        </p>
        <p>
         We see that we have record prices in goat, in lemons, in mutton, in bananas, in lamb and in sugar—all turning around. Pork, which has been doing it so tough in the past, is now getting back to record prices. Wool also is seeing a turnaround. We keep working hard because we know that it is not only how we help people on the land; it is how we help our nation's economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, the member asked for alternative policies. At the previous election the opposition went forward with 100 positive policies. And do you know, Mr Speaker, how many of them had anything to do with agriculture? Not one! Not one policy had anything to do with agriculture. Not one! They have no vision on agriculture. What they need is someone with a bit of entrepreneurial flair.

           They need someone with a bit of entrepreneurial flair. They need someone with a little bit of pizazz! They need somebody who has the capacity to find the loot! They have to find the loot. They need Senator Sam Dastyari! That's who they need—someone who has the capacity to see round the corners, to get round those difficult corners. They need a
