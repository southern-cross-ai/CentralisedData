        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister dump the other provisions of his industrial relations bill that also allow cuts to workers' pay?

         That is not what the government's bill does. It's not what it does. Labor can say it. They can assert it. They can do all of this. They can engage in the overreach that they are engaged in. But I think Australians know, whether they're employers or employees, that the measures we have put forward in this area are modest measures. They're measures that have resulted from a series of good-faith discussions between unions, employers and others to arrive at a set of practical measures that are simply designed to get more people into work as we come out of the COVID-19 recession.
        </p>
        <p>
         We got more dialogue and engagement from the union movement than we got from the opposition here, and they have lived up to their name when it comes to this. The opposition were supposed to be about working together. They've just been about no. That is the leader of the 'no opposition' that we see over there.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will engage with parties who are interested in engaging us in good faith to get Australians back to work. We have done that with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         in the Senate and we're keen to that with other parties in the Senate to ensure that we can progress these bills to ensure that we can get more Australians back into jobs after the terrible impacts of the COVID-19 recession. That's what we're doing. The opposition is just engaged in overreach, negative politics.
