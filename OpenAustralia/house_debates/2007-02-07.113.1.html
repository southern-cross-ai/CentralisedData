        Today I would like to acknowledge the work of the

         Royal Life Saving Society
        </a>

        branch, with regard to the expansion of their work in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and their strategy for rural and remote parts of New South Wales and Australia. I have had the privilege of working with David Macallister, the

        , New South Wales branch, and Mr Joe Allan, Principal of Hill Sports High School, who have had a unique and innovative vision to establish an aquatic training safety academy at Hill Sports High School. This is a project that I have wholeheartedly supported since first meeting with Mr Allan and Mr Macallister in early 2005. I want to particularly thank Senator Rod Kemp, who offered his support and visited the school to hear about and see firsthand the proposal in early 2005. I also want to thank the Hon.

        , who was instrumental in bringing this about and gave his time to meet with key stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project is being realised after a cooperative effort by and the hard work of the Royal Life Saving Society, the local school and, of course, industry. It was with great pleasure that I was able to bring the relevant stakeholders together last week and announce that the Australian government will invest $3 million of national training infrastructure funding in the new skills centre to be operated by the Royal Life Saving Society Australia. The centre will offer accredited training through the community recreation industry training package to trainers and educators across Australia, individuals and groups from remote and regional communities in New South Wales and students from Hill Sports High School as well as school students in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government funding of the project will be matched by Royal Life Saving Society Australia, New South Wales branch, and industry partners. I commend industry for getting on board with this worthwhile project, which has the dual benefit of developing a skilled workforce for the sports and recreation industry and reducing the unacceptable drowning and water injury statistics that face our nation. The Royal Life Saving Society Australia has been educating Australians about water safety for nearly 100 years and is highly respected for its work in the community, providing training in swimming and life saving. This funding will be used to construct training rooms and a swimming pool hall as well as furnish and equip the centre. This initiative is a great example of all levels of government and industry working together to expand training delivery. It is a great boost for the Royal Life Saving Society and the region, and the training provided will undoubtedly save lives. It will also provide training to upskill existing employees and new entrants to vocational and technical education as well as help create structured career paths in the aquatic industry.
