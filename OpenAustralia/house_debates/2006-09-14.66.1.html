        My question is addressed to the Minister for

         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . Would the minister outline to the House measures that the government is taking to make private health insurance a better product? How committed is the government to the private health insurance system and how does this benefit my electorate of Forde? Also, is the minister aware of any criticism of the health system, in particular the private health insurance rebate, and what is the government’s response?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Forde for her question. I appreciate her strong support for the health professionals in her area, many of whom require the private health insurance system to sustain them. Let me make it clear to the House, including the member for Forde, that support for private health insurance remains one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks to these policies, particularly the private health insurance rebate, private health cover has grown from just 30 per cent to some 43 per cent of the population. That means than nine million Australians, including 40,000 people in the electorate of Forde, now enjoy the security and choice given to them by private cover. Next year the government will make a good product even better by allowing the funds to extend their basic tables to cover treatments that will reduce or avoid the need for hospitalisation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the obvious success of our private health insurance system, members opposite still want to rip the guts out of it. They hate private health insurance. They particularly hate the private health insurance rebate, which the Leader of the Opposition once described as an extraordinarily bad piece of public policy which, in his words, ‘reinforced failure’. Then we have the member for Perth, who described the rebate as ‘a public policy crime’. At the last election, members opposite said they would keep the rebate. But we know that they had a secret plan to destroy it. The former Leader of the Opposition, in his celebrated diaries, said that Medicare Gold was ‘my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate’.

             <p class="italic">
              Medicare Gold was part of my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate ... It required a lot of work to model the private health insurance applications and to secure the cooperation of the states, all handled by Gillard.

              This week, the member for Lalor said again that she actually supported the private health insurance rebate. But, given Labor’s history of duplicity on this subject, you cannot take her assurances at face value. We know from what she said this week that she hates private health insurance.

In particular, will he keep the rebate and will he give an undertaking not to means test it or otherwise limit it? If he will not do that, the Howard government is not only the best friend that Medicare has ever had but the only friend that private health insurance has ever had.
