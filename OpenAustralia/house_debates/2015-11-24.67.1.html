         Local Government

        and Major Projects. Would the minister please update the House and the people of Petrie about the progress of the construction of the Moreton Bay Rail Link, as locals have been notified that the rail corridor will be electrified on 2 December? What has the federal government done in the last two years to fund this project? How has the federal government been working with the Queensland state government and local government—

              Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on the question. You can take a point of order on the question and whether the question is in order. Given that the project was completely funded by the previous government prior to the election, the question surely is out of order.

But, more importantly, I thank him for his strong work as an advocate for the people of Petrie. He never stops engaging with his constituents in the suburbs of

                and Rothwell. He is doing street stalls. He is in the coffee shops. He is working hard. I was very pleased to visit the member recently for the unveiling of the Mango Hill Station as part of the new Moreton Bay Rail Link. I was pleased, with the member, to speak with the Mango Hill Progress Association. What could be a stronger piece of evidence of progress in Mango Hill than the work which is occurring on this 14-kilometre new double track passenger rail line from Kippa-Ring to Lawton? Six stations are now practically complete, including

               <p>
                Mr Speaker, I do want to correct the record on something that was said incorrectly and inaccurately by the member for Grayndler before you asked him to leave. The reality of the figures is that $64.6 million was paid for this project prior to September 2013, but the total funding from the Commonwealth is $583 million. So far the Abbott and Turnbull governments have paid $368.4 million and we will pay a further $150 million. The former Labor member for Petrie, quite misleadingly, was telling people in the last election campaign that this link would not be built if the coalition came to power. She was quite wrong.
               </p>
               <p>
                Of course, we have the member for Grayndler, who really is likely the
