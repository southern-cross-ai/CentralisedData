       <p>
        Today marks the 11th anniversary since former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered the apology to the stolen generations. I, as would many others in this place, remember the day well. I remember hearing the then Prime Minister's words echoed on the evening news, and I remember their impact on my community. This was an important moment in our nation's history and an essential step for us all to take on the path towards reconciliation. I have a copy of the apology in my office. I often think of these words and how long it took for us to finally say them. We must continue to blaze the path towards reconciliation. Mere words are not enough. Our actions and the decisions that we make in this place must always reflect this vision, with the goal of healing as a nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I eagerly await the handing down of the 11th the
        <i>
         Closing the gap
        </i>
        report tomorrow, which provides a timely reminder of our goals and objectives. But
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        children are still being removed from their families at far too high a rate. First Nations people can expect to live 10 years less than the average. Incarceration rates are far too high, particularly the incarceration rates of children and young adults. The rates of smoking, alcohol abuse and the abuse of other drugs are also far too high. Babies are born with low birth weight far too commonly. We must do more. Yes, we have made some progress; but, all in all, progress has been far too slow. Today we must seriously reaffirm our goal to close the gap and tirelessly pursue a more reconciled Australia.
