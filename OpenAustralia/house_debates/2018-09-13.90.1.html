           He doesn't know what he's talking about, and we know that from the questions he's been asking today. It's been all week. What the Labor Party have been focused on is politics, lawyer picnics and all of this sort of nonsense. And what have we been talking about all week? All this week what we've been talking about—what we've been doing, more importantly—is putting in place our plans and policies for an even stronger Australia, to keep our economy strong, to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, to keep Australians safe at home and abroad and to keep Australians together. Today in this place, my colleagues have come to the despatch box in response to the questions that have been put about the issues that Australians are focused on, whether it's mental health, the increased funding we're putting into hospitals or the increased funding we're putting into schools around the country, preserving the choice that's available for parents. He doesn't want to know about this.

              . Before I call the Prime Minister, I do have to say I almost ruled the question out of order when it was first asked on the basis that leaders aren't responsible for party matters, but the Prime Minister was clearly prepared to answer it. The Prime Minister, in doing that, is within his rights to compare and contrast for a period of time, which I think he's done. He's not, obviously, compelled to use all the time that's there. I'll call the Prime Minister. I'm listening carefully to his answer.

               Thank you, Mr Speaker. I'll add one more point of compare and contrast: in this week we have not had one serious question from those opposite about drought. They're not interested in the drought; they're only interested in exploiting it. They're only intending to exploit it and not listen to farmers or others around the country. What I'm looking forward to is tonight, when the Liberal Party will gather in Wentworth and select our candidate.

                I've made the point to the Prime Minister, and indeed all ministers, that you had a period of compare and contrast, but it was a very specific question. If the Prime Minister wants to address the issues he's addressing any further, he will really need to be asked a question about it. The question really was confined to one policy area. I have some latitude, but I do have to say that I've made that clear repeatedly. The member for Grayndler?

                    The member for Grayndler, in particular, knows the standing orders with respect to who can be asked questions very well, so I have no choice but to regard that as a deliberate frivolous point of order, and he will leave under 94(a).

                     I've been asked about quotas. I'll tell you the quota we're very proud to have achieved in this party and in this government over the last five years: there are more women in jobs today than at any other time and the gender pay gap has been reduced more so than occurred under the Labor Party.

                     and National parties are about getting real results for families, for men, for women and for all Australians, because we're 100 per cent focused on the issues that matter to them. The Labor Party is only ever interested in the grubby politics that they're associated with.
