        Many businesses are struggling through this pandemic. It is a unique crisis affecting every corner of society. I wanted today to particularly single out the travel industry today for whom this crisis has been particularly damaging—the airline workers and associated businesses, tourism businesses—but the topic I want to speak about today is travel agents. Over the last few weeks I have been meeting and visiting with a number of travel agencies in my own electorate: Wentworth Travel at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        , All Tours at Edgecliff, Right Directions Travel in

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Centre" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at Edgecliff and the Travel Club Industry in Paddington. I have been hearing firsthand how they are dealing with these unprecedented challenges. Some have never been as busy but it is in processing refunds. When they have processed the refunds, they have also had to return the commissions they earned from these sales. These businesses have benefited from JobKeeper but, in many respects, it has never been tougher for them. They have many of the same costs but their cash flow is often negative because they have no new bookings coming through the door.

        International travel has taken a big hit. There are no cruises or even domestic travel, flights or packages to places like Queensland, Broome and Uluru. I want today to acknowledge the tough times they face and the stress they're under. But they are all doing the right thing, serving their customers, keeping their doors open, keeping their employees on and, for many, keeping a smile on their faces. I know this is a story being replicated across the country. I want to encourage people, if you're looking to book travel soon, to please use your local travel agents.
