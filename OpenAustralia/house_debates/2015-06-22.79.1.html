        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government's northern Australia white paper will help unlock the potential of this vital region? How has the white paper been received in the community?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for her question. She, along with almost all of the members representing northern Australia, were present in Cairns last Friday for the launch of the northern Australia paper,
         <i>
          Our north, our future
         </i>
         . I welcome the support that has been received from both sides of the House, and from state and territory governments, for this outstanding initiative—a long overdue initiative—of this government. We recognise the enormous potential there is in northern Australia. Lots of people have been saying that for a long time. There are one million people and three million square kilometres. Lots of people have been talking about the potential—we are acting now to help deliver on what that region can achieve.

           We need to work in a whole range of areas—we need to provide a level of security, land tenure, so that investors can invest with confidence. We need to provide support to assist with the development of businesses and new market opportunities in the region. Darwin, in the honourable member's electorate, will be the centre for the one-stop shop and also the headquarters of the northern Australia initiative. It will be focused right across the North; it will be delivering real results. We have devoted funds to help deliver our commitment to settle all native title claims within 10 years. There is $20 million to assist native title holders in their negotiations with businesses to ensure that economic growth will be shared amongst all Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           We want to unlock a lot of the potential by providing basic infrastructure for the North that it has lacked for so long. There is a commitment to build new roads, like the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanami_Road" rel="nofollow">
            Tanami Road
           </a>
           , the Arnhem and the Barkly Highways—those sorts of roads can make a difference in opening up northern Australia. We have committed also to finalise the business case for Ord Stage 3; we are looking at the potential to extend the

           project across the

            Northern Territory
           </a>
           border into the Territory. There is money also for a feasibility study for a railway line from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           to

            Tennant Creek
           </a>
           and to upgrade the Mount Isa to Townsville line. These are significant commitments; these are commitments that will make a difference. There is to be a new CRC for the North; support for research in medicine, tropical science and other areas where northern Australia can take a particular leadership role.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_North" rel="nofollow">
            The North
           </a>
           is already home to sophisticated cities and a lot of natural talent. We want to tap those abilities to make sure that northern Australia is able to achieve its potential and therefore benefit the whole of the continent in building a stronger nation.
