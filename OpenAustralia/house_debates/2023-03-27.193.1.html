       <p>
        I had the pleasure recently of visiting Hewett Primary School, one of the many schools located within my electorate of Spence. I'd like to thank the school for their kind invitation to present new flags to their school and to have a few words with their students. As part of my visit to Hewett primary, I got the chance to speak to our young up-and-coming leaders in their year 6 class. School visits are one of my favourite tasks as a member of this place. It's a constant reminder of my position as a role model within my community and the impact we have in shaping young minds and attitudes.

        During my visit, students asked me questions such as what it's like to be in Parliament House. Frankly, I'd like to show them, and any school in Spence that would like to visit me in our nation's capital, right here in this place. This is why our Labor government's announcement to extend a temporary increase of the Parliament and Civics Education Rebate gives me great pleasure. I encourage all schools in my electorate of Spence to look at getting involved with this excellent program and providing children with an invaluable experience that involves visiting not just Parliament House but also the
