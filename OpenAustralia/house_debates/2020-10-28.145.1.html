        Every year I love putting on the Bonner Seniors Expo to meet with so many of my constituents and put on a fun and informative day. Unfortunately, with the coronavirus pandemic, it was important that we didn't put vulnerable people at risk with large gatherings, so for 2020 we've put together a virtual seniors expo. Last year's seniors expo was a success, despite my being in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        General Assembly. We had more than 500 people through the door, with a range of exhibitors and fantastic guest speakers at the Wynnum Manly Leagues Club, who always provide great hospitality. The virtual seniors expo is up on my website now. You can access links to all our amazing stallholders, and we still have some raffle prizes donated by our generous sponsors.

        While we have not been able to come together for the annual seniors expo in Bonner, I still have had the opportunity to meet with seniors in our community. Following budget week I hosted an afternoon tea at Aveo Gardens in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_West" rel="nofollow">
         Manly West
        </a>
        . It was lovely to see and catch up with everyone. They wanted to share how happy they have been with the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        , who they declared is a strong leader for navigating Australia through the global coronavirus pandemic. It was also a good opportunity to explain some of the measures in the budget to support older Australians, including the two economic support payments of $250 that are on their way to pensioners in December and March. Next week I look forward to enjoying morning tea with the residents of Mount Gravatt TriCare and Janoah Gardens at Manly West.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope next year we will be able to come together again for the Bonner Seniors Expo to enjoy hearing from our guest speakers, have a chat and have a delicious morning tea. But for now, our small morning and afternoon catch-ups are a great to stay connected and also keep everyone safe. Thank you to all the Bonner Seniors Expo exhibitors for embracing this year's virtual expo, including local support services, who have been invaluable in keeping our vulnerable seniors in our community safe this year.
