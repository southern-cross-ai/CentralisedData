        I had intended to update the chamber on my electorate of Fairfax; however, the actions of the Greens have gotten in the way. Any sober assessment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        would lead most Australians to dismiss their disruptive ways as simply a distraction. Of course, they do routinely frustrate the passage of government reforms, and they do aim to disrupt major development projects, often in communities that need them most. But I guess we can cop some of that because, for the Greens, that's just business as usual. They're blockers, not builders; their radicals, not reformers. We know that. And their Neo-Marxist worldview masquerading often as a social conscience is plain to see too. However, last week, the member for Melbourne and his leader in the Senate plumbed new depths by implying and then accusing former

        of war crimesâ€”an appalling accusation. This was from the member for Melbourne, a member with form in this area, who once referred to the Minister for

        as a terrorist. It was a vile insult not only to a courageous and respected leader but to all men and women who have served with him, those we send in our name to endure the stress and brutality of war.
