        I rise today to call on local councils across central Queensland to state their opinion on the proposed Rookwood Weir near Rockhampton. I am fed up with the lack of encouraging support for the project from state Labor MPs, including Queensland's temporary agriculture minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Byrne" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Byrne
        </a>
        .

        civic leaders including mayors and individual councillors now need to clearly and unambiguously state their position on the weir. The federal Turnbull-Joyce government has put $132 million on the table for Rookwood Weir. Now we are hearing whispers that some factions are white-anting the project behind closed doors. If that is the case, these people risk losing the project forever, along with 2,100 new jobs and the opportunity to increase agricultural production by $1 billion a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In saying that, I do welcome and acknowledge the strong support for Rookwood Weir from Livingstone Shire Mayor Bill Ludwig and his council team from the coast. However, I warn other neighbouring councils not to be complacent about the project. I have been dismayed by the relative silence from some local governments since the Commonwealth announced it would back the Rockhampton, Livingstone and Gladstone communities to the hilt by paying for half of the construction costs.
       </p>

        It is now time for all councillors in Central Queensland to clearly state their current position. There is no middle ground here: either you want Rookwood Weir 100 per cent or you do not. There is no other water project close to Rockhampton that will be funded by the Commonwealth. You are either with the Australian government on this important project for your region or not, and if you are not supportive then you should be prepared for the funding to go to another state. The project now has both the Prime Minister's and the Deputy Prime Minister's full support. But, while state Labor dance a political game over our region's future, there is a deafening silence from some local councillors in Central Queensland about the future of Rookwood. I need to know by the end of this week if civic leaders across Central Queensland are in favour of the project proceeding.
       </p>

        Based on historic modelling, the state department of environment and water has already identified that Rockhampton, Livingston and Gladstone are in danger of running out of water for three years in every 100 yearsâ€”a problem that Rookwood would resolve. Further to this, when it comes to water,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        has already identified this region as one of the four regions across Australia with the potential for significant growth if water infrastructure is put in place.
