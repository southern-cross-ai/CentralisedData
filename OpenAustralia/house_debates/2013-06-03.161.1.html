       <p>
        I rise today to talk about an issue that is regularly raised with me in my local electorate, and that is the condition of local roads. The seat of Kingston is in an outer metropolitan area, and people rely on decent roads to get them around. Being so far, often, from the city, it is critically important that we have decent roads in the electorate. That is why I was very pleased that in the announcement of this budget there was money for both the Marion council and the City of Onkaparinga under Roads to Recovery. That is an important program, and I am pleased that that ongoing funding to the local councils will help continue to improve the roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, I was pleased that my electorate received $434,000 in this budget to fix black spots in the south. In particular, I was pleased that the projects that have been approved include the intersection of Dyson Road and O'Sullivan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Beach Road
        </a>
        , the intersection of Bains Road and Piggot Range Road, the intersection of Dyson Road and Sheriffs Road, the intersection of South Road and Flaxmill Road at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphett_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Morphett Vale
        </a>
        , the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_South_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Old South Road
        </a>
        with Reynella Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Grant Road
        </a>
        at Old Reynella, and the intersection of South Road with Majors Road and Black Road at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Halloran_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         O'Halloran Hill
        </a>
        . These are really important projects, because ensuring that our intersections are safe is critical, especially when people spend so many hours in their cars. This in fact builds on Commonwealth money that was made available by this federal government to the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Main Road
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Harbor_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Victor Harbor Road
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         McLaren Vale
        </a>
        . This was a significantly dangerous black spot, but an investment of $12 million has gone towards making that road a lot safer, and that work has just finished.

       <p>
        But there is always more work that needs to be done, and my constituents have continued to raise a number of issues when it comes to roads. That includes the duplication of commercial roads—this is in the growing area of Seaford, Seaford Rise and Seaford Meadows, where there are many more cars on the road—and improving the bridge at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Noarlunga" rel="nofollow">
         Port Noarlunga
        </a>
        , which takes people along the Dyson Road and Lonsdale Highway. The duplication of Majors Road is also something that many of my constituents have raised as an issue in ensuring that people in the Hallet Cove,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheidow_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and O'Halloran Hill area can get around more easily. The condition of Beach Road and the duplication of Beach Road is something that many retailers as well as local residents have been particularly keen on, especially between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Expressway" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the main South Road, as well as the particular stretch between South Road from Aldinga to Seaford, and Old Coach Road. These are important projects and we need to continue to work to ensure they happen.
