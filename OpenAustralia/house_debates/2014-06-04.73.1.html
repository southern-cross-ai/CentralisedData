        My question is to the Minister for Education. How many members of the cabinet were beneficiaries of free university education or manageable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS

        ? How, in good conscience, can they now slam the door on the next generation of Australians and take away the same opportunities from which they all benefited?

          I am delighted to take this question from the member from the other side. I have not done a study of the frontbench of the government to discover which universities they went to or which ones paid
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
           HECS
          </a>
          ; nor have I done so for the frontbench of the Labor Caucus.
         </p>
         <p>
          But I can tell the member that, if she wants to go back and discover who it was that decided that free education was not working—and was not bringing low-
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
           SES
          </a>
          students into universities but simply subsidising the middle classes and the upper-middle classes—she should look no further than the former Prime Minister and Treasurer
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
           Paul Keating
          </a>
          . He said at the opening of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_University" rel="nofollow">
           Victoria University
          </a>
          of Technology, Sunbury campus:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There is no such thing, of course, as 'free' education - somebody has to pay.
         </p>
         <p>
          … … …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … a 'free' higher education system is one paid for by the taxes of all, the majority of whom haven't had the privilege of a university education. Ask yourself if you think that is a fair thing.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is what Paul Keating said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The member's question gives me the opportunity to point out how far the current modern Labor Party has moved from the Hawke-Keating legacy, and to repeat the point that I made in the previous answer and question: the current Labor Party has shredded their economic credibility. Most Labor figures of the past realised that so-called free education did not have any impact on bringing students into university.

            We have a modern day example that the member for Fraser would have studied. In the United Kingdom there is free education in Scotland and there is a deregulated education market in England. As the member for Fraser knows, since deregulation in England the number of students from low-
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
             SES
            </a>
            backgrounds is at record levels. The number of students from low-SES backgrounds has ballooned in England; in Scotland there was been no change whatsoever since free education was introduced.
           </p>
           <p>
            So we are absolutely committed to our higher education reforms, because to us it is an equity measure; it is an equity reform. It will give more young people from low-SES backgrounds the opportunity that I had, and that so many members of this House had, to go to university and get the chance to increase their earning capacity over a lifetime. I am not going to slam the door behind me after I got a great university education, and nobody in the Labor Party should either. Get off your Green-Left agenda and start standing up for students from low-SES backgrounds, like I am.
