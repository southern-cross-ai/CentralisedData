       <p class="italic">
        (1) reversing Labor's decision in 2008 to abolish temporary protection visas, as part of their abolition of the Howard Government's border protection regime, that has led to more than 30,000 illegal arrivals of people by boat, more than 1,000 deaths at sea, more than 8,100 permanent protection visas being denied to people who applied for a humanitarian visa offshore because they did not come on a boat and a budget blowout for taxpayers of $6.6 billion; and

       <p class="italic">

        (e) the holder is legally barred from applying for a permanent protection visa; and
