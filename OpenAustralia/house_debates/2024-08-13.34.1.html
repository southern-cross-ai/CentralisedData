        today. Today we have fresh revelations about the incompetence of the member for Scullin. We knew he let out 178 detainees, including seven murderers, 37 sex offenders and 72 violent offenders, but now we find out that he released 83 detainees into the community without visas and that he misled the House about it.

        This man should have been sacked, but, instead, he was promoted to minister for skills. If the

        thinks his mate is going to get an easy run in skills, he'd better think again. For a fortnight, the member for Scullin has been in witness protection while Aussie skills are suffering.
