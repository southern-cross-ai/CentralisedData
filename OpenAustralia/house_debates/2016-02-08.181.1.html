        I rise to alert the House to all the wonderful nominees and recipients of citizen of the year awards that I attended in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        on 26 January. We had many nominees and a very outstanding calibre of people. I was very pleased to see that Sheila Openshaw, who has worked for decades supporting people with mental illness, was named Citizen of the Year. Jeanette Rainbow, an absolute champion of her local community, was Senior Citizen of the Year. Megan Cooper, after all her work at school and getting awareness for those that are missing out, was Young Citizen of the Year. Several community groups were nominated and everyone was very pleased that the

        of the Year was the Beach to Beach committee that is rolling out an amazing cycling-walking path in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Haven" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . There are so many people that do so much for the community.

        In the Camden Haven on the weekend I attended a trivia night where thousands of dollars were raised in the name of multiple sclerosis. We saw the battle that Chris Olive and her family have had for many years in fighting this, unfortunately, common disease. I congratulate all of those that contributed to the fundraising efforts. It is such a wonderfully strong community in the Camden Haven.
