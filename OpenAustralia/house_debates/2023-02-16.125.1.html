        I recently had the Prime Minister come and visit my electorate of Tangney. It is always a privilege to have the Prime Minister come to your community. Thankfully, Perth put on its best weather to welcome our leader to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        . I was suffering with COVID for the previous 10 days. It was the second time I caught the virus and it hit me really hard. I couldn't celebrate

        and was confined in isolation until the Prime Minister's visit. We brought in the

        </a>
        , which to Chinese people represents hope, peace and prosperity. This is what the Albanese Labor government represents to Australian families.
       </p>
       <p>
        With any new year comes new opportunity, and I have been telling my constituents that the Albanese Labor government means a lot of new opportunity for the Australian people and the people of Tangney. I took Prime Minister Albanese to a local coffee shop in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Walter" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Tangney. I was so proud to introduce my boss to my wife, my daughters and my granddaughter, Alina. I know that our government will deliver on this promise of closing the gender pay gap for women like my daughters and my granddaughter. It will create a better future for them and for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members in this place know that I often speak about the many multicultural communities in Tangney. I was pleased to introduce the Prime Minister to some of these community leaders. I thank Prime Minister Albanese and his staff for being so generous with their time on their visit. He met many community leaders in Tangney, and among them were the representatives of the Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese and Indian communities. He took many photographs with them and had some very positive conversations with all of them. When former Prime Minister Morrison came to Perth on 15 March 2022, he avoided taking photos with Chinese-Australians in Western Australia. There is a clear change between the Albanese Labor government and the Morrison government: a change in the way Australia and the Prime Minister engage on the global stage, and a change in the way that the Prime Minister engages with multicultural Australians on the ground in communities like Tangney. I really appreciate the Prime Minister spending time, being accessible and spreading some of his love in my electorate. The people of Tangney are really looking forward to his next visit. Thank you.
