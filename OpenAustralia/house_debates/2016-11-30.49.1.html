        I have shared with the House the successes and the challenges in the electorate of Groom, particularly in Toowoomba and certainly around Oakey. The other important rural township of Pittsworth I refer to today. Too often in the media we hear that country towns are dying. Unfortunately, that is the image that all too often sticks in the minds of our city cousins. I will acknowledge that some regional towns are certainly facing challenges. Certainly Oakey is, as well as Pittsworth. But there are many towns that are embracing the issues they face and are doing something about it. Pittsworth is such a town.

        Pittsworth District Alliance is a progressive group led by Mark Droney and his fearless executive. I have witnessed firsthand their passion for their communityâ€”and what a community it is. The Pittsworth District Alliance has launched a shop local campaign in a bid to drive the local economy. This involves a gift-card system that can be used through a normal

        event. And I look forward to being there.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pittsworth District Alliance is a community organisation that gives its whole community a voice. I for one applaud that. Those who will join with us on 20 December will not be disappointed. They will truly enjoy the spirit of Pittsworth.
