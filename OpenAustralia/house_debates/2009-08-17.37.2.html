               My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to recent comments by the Minister for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
                Health and Ageing
               </a>
               regarding tax increases to pay for the future of Australia’s health system, when she said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … it is something that we have to include in the mature debate about how we fund health care.
              </p>
              <p>
               Given that the government is now running deficit budgets and is now borrowing record levels of money, Prime Minister, what taxes will need to be increased to pay for the minister’s health plan?

                I sense a theme emerging on the part of those opposite. It has been prosecuted with subtlety, it has been prosecuted with finesse, it has been prosecuted with the back handle of an axe. I say to those opposite, when it comes to the future of tax reform: in response to the business community and the 2020 Summit last year, in response to the representations of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 Business Council of Australia
                </a>
                and many other peak industry groups, the government believes that the right thing to do is to have a root-and-branch review of the tax system. That is why we have commissioned the Secretary to the Treasury to do so. Furthermore, I say to the shadow Treasurer, the member for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                 North Sydney
                </a>
                : when it comes to the future of health and hospital reform—I assume he has read the report produced by Commissioner Bennett—one of the recommendations which was put forward by the commission relates to an increase in the Medicare levy. Therefore, I would say to those opposite, before they go into ‘ha-ha’ mode—‘Here is a possible discussion about a further tax’—that the commission is quite upfront about the fact that there is one possible way of funding a future approach to the reform of dental care and their particular proposal for denticare. I say to those opposite, as they engage in a fear campaign on debt and deficit, a fear campaign on tax, a fear campaign on health and hospitals, a fear campaign on industrial relations, a fear campaign on climate change and a fear campaign on employment, that what the Australian public would like is a mature national discussion about the options which lie before us.

                  He interjects, ‘Put it on the table’—like the Ergas review, the one which was put out there in April 2008—but my attention has been drawn to a further proposal on tax reform, which was the subject of some discussion a year or two ago between the member for Higgins and the member for Wentworth. It is this thing here, called
                  <i>
                   Taxation reform in Australia: some alternatives and indicative costings
                  </i>

                   Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Prime Minister about his own health minister’s statement and asked him to engage in a mature debate and put on the table those tax increases the Prime Minister wants.

                     We are talking about tax options for the country’s future. Our approach is clear-cut. We have the Secretary to the Treasury working through these things. Those opposite said last year that the approach was clear-cut; it is just that it has disappeared—that is, the Ergas review. Absent the Ergas review, we are left with the Turnbull proposals of 29 August 2005. In a great interview between

                      Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: because of your admonition last week that the opposition ask specific questions that do not invite debate, the shadow Treasurer has asked a very specific question about comments from the Minister for

                      about tax. If the Prime Minister does not wish to answer those specific questions, he should sit down. He is not being relevant to the question that was asked now.

                             Yes, Mr Speaker. The point of order is relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about the minister for health’s comments on tax. I ask the Prime Minister to be real with the Australian people and answer the question.
