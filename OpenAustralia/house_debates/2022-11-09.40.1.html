        Nothing gives me more pleasure than to come to this place and speak about my favourite little town of Goombungee. The Goombungee Jacaranda Day festival has been a fixture of the Toowoomba region's social calendar for 24 years. It's a fantastic event that I encourage anyone to come along to see. I was thrilled to attend last weekend and show my support for what is a great community event—celebrating the town becoming a sea of purple. We had a very late bloom for the Jacarandas this year but, thankfully, they came out on time. I know the member for Pearce will fondly remember the sea of purple that comes across Toowoomba at that time of year. What I love about Jacaranda Day is that every club, organisation and business in town gets involved. They contribute by hosting stalls, serving food and participating in the parade—and who doesn't love a fantastic smalltown parade?

        I personally got the chance to sample the cooking of the wonderful ladies from the Goombungee

        —yes, scones and pikelets—inspect a couple of great Sunbeam motorcycles on display and check out the museum's new diorama showcasing the town's history. It's the incredible effort of these groups and their hardworking volunteers that helps attract so many visitors to the festival every year. It was great to see the balcony of the historic Pioneer Arms Hotel absolutely full, with the owner, Tom, doing a roaring trade. People don't make the drive from Brisbane and beyond just to come out and get the Jacaranda social media op—they come to experience the Goombungee hospitality, which is on display at the pub. I give a huge thank you to the organising committee and everyone who played a part in making Jacaranda Day happen. I can't wait to join you again for the 25th celebration next year.
