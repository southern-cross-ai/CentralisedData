       <p>
        I proudly stand here today to praise two outstanding organisations in my electorate. These organisations continue to go above and beyond the call of duty to help members of the Orange and Bathurst communities. They are often relied upon to help some of the central west's most vulnerable people, and the way they continue to cater for people with specific needs is nothing short of outstanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to talk about a little school in Orange that is doing wonderful and big things. That little school is Anson Street School. It caters for around 90 students. This is not just any ordinary school. Anson Street School caters for students with moderate and severe intellectual disabilities. A large number of students have communication, motor and sensory impairments, and many have high-support needs. An individual education plan is provided for each student, with programs being developed by staff in collaboration with parents and caregivers, and other relevant personnel. This ensures quality educational outcomes for all of these students. But the best thing about Anson Street School is the fact that parents and carers know the students are provided with a safe, caring and very good learning environment. I have attended quite a lot of events at Anson Street over the years and the continued development of programs has been very impressive and amazing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May last year I was involved in the school's opening of two permanent new buildings. The federal government provided $3.8 million in funding and that is money well spent, as this school continues to go from strength to strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to make a special mention of principal Gary Brotherton and his staff. They all do an amazing job, teaching and providing for these students. It is an honour to be involved with them because they are very special people. The efforts of Gary Brotherton and his staff do not go unnoticed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having spoken about those younger students who need a hand, I would also like to speak about those in Bathurst who are older. The Bathurst Seymour Centre,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSC" rel="nofollow">
         BSC
        </a>
        , is the second organisation I would like to talk about.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bathurst Seymour Centre is a centre-based day-care centre, providing for older people who are frail aged, people with a disability and their carers who live in the Bathurst area. The service aims to enable people to live independently and to participate in community life. To realise this vision, BSC provides a range of centre-based services designed to enhance the wellbeing and the quality of life of people who are frail aged, people with dementia and people with disabilities. The BSC provides support for their carers. This is no light thing. BSC services promote opportunities for social interaction and participation in a great range of activities. I have seen how well looked after they are and how much they enjoy it.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has 12 full-time employees and more than 50 volunteers. It could not happen without those volunteers, who assist more than 70 people in the region. They are doing a wonderful job for those who need this attention and they also provide respite for the carers of these people. Respite is a very big issue in these circumstances. Any centre that offers a safe, friendly and welcoming environment so that people can learn new skills and are encouraged to keep healthy and active should be embraced. That is why I want to draw attention today to both these organisationsâ€”for those who give their professional time, certainly, but also those who volunteer for it. I have always said no government can ever provide what volunteers provide. At any of the three levels, the amount of money they save the organisation and the actual 'get up and go' are irreplaceable. I am saying a big thankyou to centre manager Terisa Ashworth, her staff and the valued volunteers. You are doing an amazing job and setting a great example to all of us.
