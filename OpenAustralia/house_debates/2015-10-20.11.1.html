        I rise to pay tribute to two brothers who died this year and who made major contributions to Tasmania. Trevor Roach died in Launceston on 26 June aged 86, having given 40 years of valuable service to local government and numerous community groups. His brother Ronald Roach died in Launceston on 27 September at the age of 95. Ronald was a pioneer of Tasmanian tourism promotion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor was a cabinet-maker by trade and operated a joinery business before being elected to the Beaconsfield Council in 1970. He was warden for 16 years and when it became the

        , he continued to serve as a councillor and mayor. He gave 50 years of service to the Riverside Lions Club, where I am also a member, and was a great supporter of the Exeter Show and many sporting groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ronald was a mechanic by trade and served in the

       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor and Ronald Roach were remarkable men who made enormous contributions to Northern Tasmania. I express my condolences to their family and many friends.
