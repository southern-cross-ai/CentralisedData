        As parliamentarians, it is our privilege and our duty to represent the views of our constituents in this place. The foundation of that critical work is a constant process of listening and advocacy. I am committed to always being available to the people of Fisher. The summer recess has given me a wonderful opportunity to get out and about in Fisher. I used that time to hold 11 listening posts last week. These listening posts are my way of bringing my office to the people of Fisher. Last week, I held community barbecues at our picnic spots in

        and Conondale, beachside meetings at Mooloolaba and

        and caught up with people as they went about their business in Maleny and on their way to work at Landsborough train station.

        I am proud to report today to the House what our people told me that they care about. They told me that they want the government to continue its drive to give all Australians access to high-speed internet through our national broadband scheme. They told me that they want us to ensure that we reform superannuation so that it is fair and works for everyone. And they told me that they want a pension system that provides dignity to those who need it most. They also told me that they demand honesty, accountability and transparency from their elected representatives. I am determined to be a federal member who listens. I intend to hold many more listening posts in the future and to go on reporting to the House.
