       </p>
       <p>
        We have now lost 38 very brave Australian people in Afghanistan, and collectively today we gather to speak about that bravery and their selfless contribution to our country. Thirty-eight lives lost is 38 too many. Indeed, the campaign in Afghanistan has become a very expensive one in human terms. For a country our size, 38 is a large loss. Later this morning or this afternoon we will also be speaking about Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher, who tragically lost their lives within 24 hours of the loss of these three fine soldiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        These debates are always difficult for all of us in this place because it is us collectively who take the decision to send these young people to war, but I stand here today still very confident that we went to Afghanistan for the right reason, we remain in Afghanistan for the right reason and we are determined that we should finish our campaign in Afghanistan. We went there to make the world a safer place for all people, including of course Australians. We saw the carnage that can be set upon our people in places like Bali and Jakarta by people who were trained or had some association with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qaeda" rel="nofollow">
         Al Qaeda
        </a>
        in Afghanistan. Afghanistan had became a lawless state—a state prepared to host and provide a training field and a launching pad for those prepared to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, again including on Australians. It was the right thing to do to intervene on that lawlessness and everything that flows from it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe we are making progress in Afghanistan—I have no doubt about that. We are not only building capacity to enforce the local rule of law but building a democracy, an economy, a health system, schools and a society, and therefore, hopefully, we are putting in place a setting for good things rather than bad things. It is hard. No-one said it would be easy. We were always going to lose lives, but there is one thing I am very confident about: all of our volunteers who go to Afghanistan go with enthusiasm and know all of the risks involved, but they do so very willingly and very keenly. I do not think I knew any of the three men—it is possible that I may have met them at some point as defence minister—but I do know that the local rule of law will also have applied to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having met many families on the occasion of earlier losses, I am confident that the families of these brave soldiers also knew the risk but supported their decision to take that risk. I would be very surprised if, like the soldiers themselves, the parents did not believe and do not believe in the mission and what their loved ones, friends and mates were doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night I had the pleasure of speaking at the reception to mark both the 93rd anniversary of the independence of Afghanistan and the 10th anniversary of the formal diplomatic relationship between Australia and Afghanistan. We were partly celebrating Afghanistan's progress—progress from a lawless state, as I said, towards what I am very confident will become a thriving society. It does have a potential economic base. It boasted, in the past, of being a land sitting on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Route" rel="nofollow">
         Silk Route
        </a>
        and flourishing, and I believe it will flourish again. We need to stay the course and help them through the next steps. It would be a terrible thing if we allowed 38 fine Australians to give their life in vain—in other words, if we do not finish what we are doing in Afghanistan. I think a precipitous withdrawal would be an enormous mistake. It would be a bit like not paying the final two payments on your mortgage. We have made the big investment, it has been costly, but that is all the more reason to finish the job. To walk away now before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan National Security Forces
        </a>
        are ready to enforce that country's own rule of law would be a very big mistake.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hear so often people say: 'You cannot win in Afghanistan. Alexander the Great was not able to win in Afghanistan. The Russians were not able to win in Afghanistan.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English" rel="nofollow">
         The English
        </a>
        did not have much success in Afghanistan.' Historically that might be true, but in this campaign we are working with the democratically elected government of the day in Afghanistan against a common foe. Sometimes the lines become blurred as to who is friend and who is enemy, and very sadly in the case of these three soldiers we have learned just how blurred those lines can be. It must be very hard for our troops to deal with the green on blue dynamic. I can think of nothing worse—as if it is not hard enough—than going to war without being absolutely sure that the guy who is marching alongside you is your friend. So this is difficult, and it is a challenge for the government and everyone participating in the campaign in Afghanistan. But it is another thing that we just need to manage, and I am sure that manage it we will.
       </p>
       <p>
        I join with others in extending my deepest sympathies to Lance Corporal Milosevic's wife Kelly, his young daughters Sarah and Kate—it is so sad that there are such young people involved here—his mother Heather and his brother Milan and sister Danica; to Sapper Martin's mother Suzanne, sister Holly, step-brother Angus and grandparents Ralph and Lucille Thomas; and to Private Poate's parents Hugh and Janny and sister Nicola. Like others who have spoken, I also extend my sympathies to those in the 2nd/14th

         I say at the outset that I totally support everything said by the Chief Government Whip. A week or so ago I attended a dinner which was for a school reunion and when the apologies were read out one of those apologies was a very good friend of mine at school, Hugh Poate. We spent many years in the same house and the shooting team together. We had a lot of fun. We did a lot of silly things together. When the reason for his absence was given, it was that his son had died in Afghanistan, as one of the three killed by a rogue

         sergeant. There is no decision we make in government and in parliament that you take as seriously as when you decide that you will commit Australian troops overseas into a war situation. I was part of the parliament and, indeed, the government who actually did that. I had never met Robbie. I rang Hugh as a very good friend and as somebody who had that responsibility. I realised Robbie must have been a pretty special person when Hugh just said, 'Do not be silly. Robbie was there because he wanted to be. He was there because he was a very good soldier and we are incredibly proud of him.' To be judgemental would have been a very forgivable and, in fact, natural thing for him to have been, but he and his family are just unbelievable. I said I would be honoured to speak on behalf of his family in the parliament about Private Robbie Poate and he accepted that, and what I am about to say now is what Private Robert Hugh Poate's family would want the parliament and the people of Australia to hear. His funeral is at one o'clock today in Canberra.

         Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate was one of three Australian soldiers killed by a rogue

         solider at a patrol post in the Baluchi Valley, Afghanistan, on Wednesday, 29 August 2012. He was just 23 years of age. Robbie was sitting down with his mates playing cards after a long day at work when he was killed. Five soldiers were hit with automatic gunfire from the rogue ANA soldier. Three died instantly, Robert being one of them. The other two who died were 39-year-old

         Robbie is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. Robert Poate spent 15 years at

          Canberra Grammar School
         </a>
         , graduating from year 12 in 2007 after completing his final four years as a boarder in Blaxland House. He was a superb all-round athlete and was awarded House Colours and the Mark Sowell Award for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoor_Education" rel="nofollow">

         . He was captain of the Open Grade Third
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XV" rel="nofollow">
          XV
         </a>
         Rugby team where he played as five-eighth, and he regularly played with the Second XV. In his final year Robbie won the open 400-metre race at the school athletic carnival and came second in the cross-country. He was also an excellent swimmer and a cross-country skier. At school, Robert was a very level-headed boy with a mature moral compass far ahead of his age, but he also loved to let his hair down and have fun with his mates. This fun-loving part of him continued into his young adult life. He knew how to balance his life responsibly. A one-minute silence was observed in Robert's honour at the final of the 1st XV Canberra School Boys Rugby Union match last Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
         After leaving school, Robert worked in the building industry for a year then decided that he would like to be part of the Anzac legend and he enlisted in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         . After completing basic training at Kapooka, and infantry training at Singleton, he applied to join 6 Battalion RAR in Brisbane, and hoped to get into D Company of 6 Battalion. He asked for this posting because of the proud history of D Company, 6RAR at the Battle of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
          Long Tan
         </a>
         in Vietnam. Of the 23 young men who applied, five were accepted, Robert being one of them. He had an enthusiastic quest for knowledge and completed an impressive list of Army training qualifications in a short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         He went to Afghanistan as a commander of a Bushmaster armoured vehicle/troop carrier. In Afghanistan his senior staff had so much faith and confidence in his abilities that his vehicle became the lead vehicle in convoys and patrols. Robert would have had a very bright future with the Army had he survived.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a statement issued by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         , Rob was described as a wholly qualified soldier who was known for having outstanding leadership potential. Since enlisting in 2009, he had been awarded a number of honours and had completed a promotion course for Corporal in 2011. Robert will be fondly remembered by his 'Brothers of choice' in 6RAR as a very popular and highly skilled soldier of the Australian Army.
        </p>
        <p>
         Robert was proud of his family, his military service, his Canberra origins and his red hair, which he vehemently defended as being strawberry blonde. Robert was very gregarious. He loved to be with his mates and people loved to be around him. His nickname was Poate and he had a very quick and keen sense of humour with an incredible array of one-liners. Following Robert's death, his mates named his Bushmaster vehicle 'Poate' in his honour and this name is now painted on the side of his vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
         His father, Hugh Poate, said: 'Robert certainly did the Anzac legend of Australian military service very proud.' He loved the Army where he was performing his supreme duty for his country and, tragically, he made the supreme sacrifice in the process. He was a delightful boy who grew and matured into a truly wonderful young man. He possessed a gentle, caring nature and only saw the good in people. He would have made a wonderful husband and father. Hugh also said: 'Since Robert's death, our family has been overwhelmed by the support received from immediate family, friends, Canberra Grammar School and the Army. Since the day Robert enlisted, we have been made to feel part of the Army family and this was particularly so during his deployment in Afghanistan. It is not only Janny, Nicola and I who have lost a son and a brother, but the Army has also lost a son and a brother, and I know that the Army is grieving with us. I have seen it and felt it. The motto of 6 Battalion is "Brothers by choice". The brotherhood of these young men is something very special, which I have also personally felt. We are receiving wonderful support at this very difficult time from Robert's Army colleagues, his senior officers and other areas of the Australian Defence Force.'

          It is another terribly sad occasion where we rise to commemorate and pass our condolences to these lost sons of Australia and their families. It was one of the most tragic days, as has been reflected upon, in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          's history—certainly the largest loss of lives since Vietnam—in two separate incidents which we will reflect on in two separate motions. Three individuals, the subjects of this motion, were from three different units all based at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

          —units that I have great familiarity with and also affection for from my time at Gallipoli Barracks, having played rugby in the 25th anniversary 6

           CER

          as well. These three individuals encapsulate all that is fine and all that is the best of the traditions of those three units.
         </p>
         <p>
          We heard a wonderful tribute by the member for Calare in relation to Private Robert Hugh Poate. Poate was a member of 6RAR. He mentioned the motto of that unit—'brothers by choice'—but the nickname is also 'blue dog'. The mascot of 6RAR is a blue cattle dog. They particularly chose a blue cattle dog because they wanted to focus people on the attributes that those dogs are known for: their tenacity, their faithfulness and their loyalty. Certainly, all of those qualities are encouraged, fostered and developed in 6RAR, and well exemplified by Private Poate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The motto of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Regiment
          </a>
          is 'Duty first', and no-one more exemplified that motto than Robert Poate. He was so focused on his career at that young age and performing extremely well. He was a protected mobility vehicle driver, driving one of those magnificent Australian Bushmaster vehicles which have protected and saved so many lives in Afghanistan and have been a tremendous tribute to Australian industry; the Bushmaster is also a weapons system and an asset that requires a great deal of skill to work with in an operational environment, and certainly Private Poate had that. As has been mentioned, one of the vehicles has been named 'Poatey'—that is painted on the side of the vehicle—and that is a tremendous tribute. His colleagues obviously will continue to and will always remember him for the wonderful member of the team that he was, and for his good humour and his professionalism, serving as he was on his first deployment. He was a young man who had not had time to build a life outside of the Army, but this was actually partly by choice. We know that he had said to his family that he was not particularly interested in trying to establish a long-term relationship at this point in time because he wanted to focus on the mission in Afghanistan, to focus on the job. He said to his father: 'I am not going to get emotionally involved because I don't want to take any baggage with me; I've got to be 100 per cent focused 100 per cent of the time because I am responsible for every person aboard that vehicle.' Nothing exemplifies this individual and the 'Duty first' motto better than those comments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Interestingly, too, we are talking about a green-on-blue incident. It was revealed by the family that, in a phone call to his father, Private Poate actually described the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANA" rel="nofollow">
           ANA
          </a>
          members that he was working with as a fantastic bunch of people—'They just love us Aussies. They play cricket with us. All you've got to do is respect their customs and there's no problems.' So Private Poate had had a very good experience of working with the ANA—until this point, of course. And there have been many thousands of ANA soldiers that our people have worked with, notwithstanding that we have had these incidents involving a couple of individuals. But I will come back to that point in a minute.
         </p>
         <p>
          I turn now to Sapper James Martin, who was a member of the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, also based at Enoggera, as I mentioned. He was a very special person in many ways—a deep person; an intellectual soldier. The motto of the 2nd CER is 'The magnificent bastards', and certainly, in my experience of them, they were just that. Sapper Martin was magnificent in many ways as an individual, but it is important for all of us to understand the special role the sappers perform in Afghanistan. Their role requires nerves of steel: the daily tension and the daily risks that the sappers undertake in Afghanistan are extreme. I know many members, colleagues on both sides, who have been over to experience the parliamentary exchange program and have had the briefings about the improvised explosive devices and understand the daily test of these people's character, their nerves, their professionalism, and their ability to detect and defuse these weapons and protect our people. That requires very special skill, very special courage and very special nerves. Certainly, Sapper Martin had all of those things. He was a fine tribute to the traditions of the engineers, and there would be, no doubt, many members of the ADF who owe their protection, who owe their safety, who owe the fact that they are not injured and are still with us, to the work of Sapper Martin and what he was able to achieve in Afghanistan. We all send our best wishes to his family as well. I know that his regiment, a wonderful unit, will continue to preserve his memory.
         </p>
         <p>
          Finally, I come to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Corporal" rel="nofollow">
           Lance Corporal
          </a>
          Rick Milosevic, known as 'Milo' to the crew. Rick came to the Army late in life, at the age of 36, which was interesting and incredible in itself. He went through the whole recruit process at the age of 36, which is remarkable. And he was no slouch in that process, and was awarded most outstanding soldier at Kapooka and was presented with an award for the trainee of merit.
         </p>
         <p>
          He had a family, of course, and he had been deployed in his short time in

           Iraq
          </a>
          as well as Afghanistan. He also came from a very proud unit, the 2nd/14th
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">
           Light Horse
          </a>
          Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which has a history going back to 1860. It saw many proud campaigns in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_War" rel="nofollow">
           Boer War
          </a>

           First World War
          </a>
          . It is a unit that proudly wears the emu feather, as Rick did.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rick was a very keen participant in Army rugby. The Army is a family in itself, but certainly an even tighter family within that family is the Army rugby community, which I tremendously enjoyed being a part of. Rick will be closely remembered in that he was a classic forward build, a stocky chap—he had the right neck for it. Every year we play a curtain-raiser to the tri-service rugby competition between the Army rugby old boys and the Navy old salts. Before each game we toast the members of the rugby fraternity that we have lost in the preceding year through whatever cause. I can guarantee that next year our comrades and colleagues in Army rugby and Navy rugby will be toasting Rick Milosevic before the game. Well done, Rick, on a magnificent effort and a magnificent career. We are so proud of you. We extend our condolences to Rick's partner, Kelly; his daughters Sarah and Kate; and his mother, brothers and sisters. We will sadly miss Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic.
         </p>
         <p>
          I did mention the issue of the green-on-blue situation, which has become deeply disturbing. I think a lot of Australians can accept combat casualties where men and women have their faces turned to the enemy, and they understand that that is part of the risk and sacrifice involved in a defence career. But it is hard to take situations where men and women have downed tools, effectively, and have taken off their combat body armour and are relaxing. Here they were, based in Patrol Base Wahab, relaxing with their colleagues when this incident occurred. That seems particularly cowardly to Australians and it is particularly hard to take in this context. If we are there to train and build the capacity of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
           Afghan National Army
          </a>
          , then how is it that we would take casualties like this? Is it worth persevering with a mission to train these people if this is the way they are going to treat us? It is a natural instinct and it is also highly commendable that as Australians we continue to question whether we should be there and whether the sacrifices are worth it. That is entirely commendable and I would encourage Australians to continue to question. But, of course, in my role as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence I have responsibility for this Afghanistan transition. I have spent a lot of time there, as I have mentioned previously, and the mission is progressing well. The task of building the competency of the ANA is meeting the time lines and the criteria and is passing through the gateways that we have set.
         </p>
         <p>
          There has been a big effort in creating comprehensive policies to try to mitigate these types of incidents. We are also conducting a cultural compatibility study, because the issue is that it is very hard to determine whether they are insurgent-inspired events or whether they are related to some other grievance, mental problem or cultural clash that has occurred. As far as we can eliminate these kinds of issues—any friction or cultural clashes that might feed these sorts of incidents, which are apparently a large part of what has happened in Afghanistan over recent months and years—then we will obviously make every effort to do that. We continually review force protection measures, all the time, and we have invested a great deal of money into trying to protect our people. I welcome the decision of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Ministry_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
           Afghan Ministry of Defence
          </a>
          to remove many of those people who are suspect through their more rigorous vetting processes.
         </p>
         <p>
          We do not know at this stage what was behind this individual attack on our people. But let us assume, for argument's sake, that it was an insurgent-inspired activity. What would be the consequence of changing our strategy of responding to an attack like this and pulling out in the face of such a strategy? All that it would do would be to encourage our enemy to pursue this strategy.
         </p>
         <p>
          The best thing that we can do to fight a strategy like this is to not let it affect our approach to the mission in Afghanistan, to not let it affect us finishing this mission, which we are so close to. There are, effectively, only a few months left in the high-activity phase of our security operations for our own personnel as we are now seeking to intersect the situation where we reduce that security environment to a position where, as it was described to me, the grass is cut where the locals can maintain the lawn. That intersection is not far off and, once that occurs, we will be moving into an overwatch Ready Reaction Force type role. Our people will no longer be in the patrol bases. We will be much more secure in the main base at Tarin Kot and these risks will be fewer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Here we are now, we can see that it is within our grasp to better secure our people to achieve that mission and to move on. So to bend to any kind of a strategy like this, if that were indeed what was at the heart of this, would only serve to encourage these kinds of attacks against our people, to only send a message to the world that yes, you can change Australia's policy, you can bend Australia to your will if you can set up incidents like this or conduct attacks like this and cause a certain level of casualty to achieve that objective. We need to send a message to our enemy, to our opponents, to those who wish us ill in the world that we will not bend to these tactics, if those were indeed the tactics that were employed in this event.
         </p>
         <p>
          We will not do that; we will not change our strategy. We will stick with our course and we will honour the legacy of those who have served this country before, in uniform, through dire times—through the direst of times in World War
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

          when this nation was under threat and when sacrifices were made such that in the order of 48,000 people were killed in that conflict. We have shown in the past that we have the steel to see things through, to honour the legacy of people like this who have served our nation so well, to finish this mission, which is within sight.
         </p>
         <p>
          I commend the service of these men and I pass on my condolences to their family. I know that nothing can really be said to dull the intensity of the grief that they are experiencing. I also honour their resolve as they pass on to us the task to see these missions through. We salute the service of these three individuals.

           It is in sad circumstances that, once again, we stand to acknowledge the loss of our best and our bravest. This time, tragically, it is not one soldier but five.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 29 August five Australian troops were killed in two separate incidents in Afghanistan. It was only the last sitting period in which we spoke of the courageous efforts of Sergeant Blaine Diddams and today we stand again to send what little words of comfort we can offer to the families of the five gallant men. I pay tribute to the eloquent words of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, the member for Eden-Monaro, and for his moving tribute to those men whom he knew. I know of his service to the nation and I know the loss which he is experiencing and which, indeed, he feels every time that one of our soldiers is tragically taken in Afghanistan. As parliamentarians we all feel a great sense of loss and also a great sense of responsibility because it is this parliament which sends those brave young men and women to these conflict situations and, sadly, we know we do that in the knowledge that some of them will not come home.
          </p>
          <p>
           When our service men and women leave this country to serve overseas it comes with a great element of risk. We know that and they know that. Unfortunately, that knowledge does little to ease the pain and these words of tribute do little to reduce the shock when the terrible news comes that our soldiers have been taken, particularly when they have been taken in rogue incidents such as this one. Not since the Battle of Nui Le in Vietnam, on 21 September 1971, has Australia lost five men in a 24-hour period.

The Brisbane based soldiers were playing cards in their tent at a patrol base when they were unexpectedly attacked by a rogue Afghan sergeant—someone they were soldiering alongside, someone they were training, encouraging and protecting. The three men arrived home on 5 September 2012 and received a ramp ceremony. That was not the way they would have liked to have come home and not the way that anyone would have expected them to come home.

           Lieutenant General David Morrison described this moving return of these men as a 'cathartic moment' for the families. Lieutenant General Morrison said the families of these three soldiers, who had 'suffered so grievously', 'took huge pride in their service'. He said:

           Born in 1972, Rick actually trained at Kapooka, where he was awarded the Most Outstanding Soldier Award. That is an award that comes with a lot of pain and effort, because at Kapooka they train our soldiers to be the best, the bravest and the brightest. In all of the world there is no better soldier than the Australian soldier, and certainly those turned out of Kapooka are the very best and the most gallant.

           To his partner, Kelly, his daughters Sarah, aged just eight, and Kate, aged six, his mother, brothers and sisters, I offer my deepest condolences and certainly those of all the people of the Riverina. You think of his daughters, aged eight and six, having to grow up without the love of a father or the comfort of a dad. It is a terrible thing, but they will know that their dad was one of the greatest. I am sure their mum will remind them always of what a great man he was and what a great man he could and would have been.

He wrote to his family after his first deployment that he was meant to be an Australian soldier. That is what he wanted to do, that is what he was proudest of doing and he knew it was what he was best at doing. It was a goal he had achieved and he had done very bravely. To Sapper Martin's mother, Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother and sister, Angus and Holly, and his grandparents, Lucille and

           Lieutenant Colonel Mark Jennings farewelled Private Poate, saying he was a 'hard worker' and a 'larrikin'. Private Poate, he said, was a popular member of his platoon, 'dependable and ready to do what was required'. We heard earlier the member for Calare describe his personal knowledge of the private's family. He is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. Just days before his deployment to Afghanistan in June, Private Poate's dad, Hugh, took his son aside and offered him a few words of advice, as a dad would do for his son:

           These Australians were killed at the hands of terrorist activity. Our soldiers are directly protecting and trying to instil the ideals of freedom among peace-seeking Afghans. Their efforts are lauded, honoured and respected, and they will always be remembered. Thirty eight brave Australians have now been lost in Afghanistan; 38 courageous soldiers; 38 men with families and loved ones—young men gone long before their time. Their efforts were not in vain. Their dedication has helped to bring hope to a troubled country, now far more than a threatening haven for terrorists. They have ensured the Anzac spirit continues to burn brightly. Lest we forget.

            I too, sadly, rise to speak about the recent tragic loss of life in Afghanistan. It was referred to in the media by the defence minister, the

            Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Poate were three Australian soldiers born in very different parts of Australia—in Penrith, in Perth and in Canberra. They were soldiers at different stages of their military careers and of their own lives. Two of them were young men on their first deployment while the other was an older father of two making his second deployment overseas.
           </p>
           <p>
            On such occasions, it is hard to know what are the correct words to use for such a speech. I do not know what the right words are but I do know on such occasions saying nothing is obviously the wrong thing to do. So I am particularly keen to say something to commemorate these three soldiers, particularly as a Queenslander, since they were based in Queensland. I am not sure who my audience is, whether it is the families and friends of Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Pate listening now or whether it will be Sarah and Kate Milosevic perhaps listening in 20 years time or reading in 20 years time the words said about their father.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously, it is an important time to be speaking. We recently celebrated the 11th anniversary of the September 11 tragedy in the United States and we are coming up to the 10-year anniversary of the Bali bombings. We do know that our soldiers, our sailors and our airmen put themselves in harm's way so that Australians can sleep safer in their beds at night. I know occasionally when there are deaths overseas of our soldiers, sailors and airmen that some people will ask questions about the validity of such campaigns. I was in Pakistan only two weeks ago—we did not go to Afghanistan because of the danger over there. When people talk about how we should not be in such campaigns, I do know that we need our soldiers, sailors and airmen to be there because, as we saw after the Bali bombing, such terror can be exported around the world and can be right on our doorstep or even inside our house perhaps.

            , in 1972. He enlisted in the Army in 2008 as a 36-year-old. He had a long and interesting career before then but it says something about the ticker of the man who, as a 36-year-old, went through Kapooka, where they would have done him no favours whatsoever because of his age. So he must have had a fair bit of ticker to want to join up as a 36-year-old. Even though for me 36 seems quite young I am sure he would have been surrounded by 18- and 19-year-olds who would have been keen to show up the older figure. Since he came through with flying colours, I think he must have had real ticker as a man. He was posted as a cavalryman to the 2nd/14th

            , Queensland Mounted Infantry, in Brisbane in 2009 on completion of his basic training and initial deployment training. His potential was quickly identified and he achieved outstanding course results in a short period of time, being promoted to Lance Corporal in 2011 and becoming a light armoured vehicle crew commander. Lance Corporal Milosevic was a highly qualified soldier with a strong future. He was a much liked and respected member of the regiment—a typical Aussie bloke, friendly, funny and very down to earth. I understand his leadership and professional abilities stood out in the unit and also on operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also note that he was very successful on the rugby field. I should stress I do not know Lance Corporal Milosevic and I would hate to be defaming him but I have assumed, from looking at his photos, that he played in the forwards. I say this as a hooker. I would hate to find out that he was actually in the backs. He looked like one of those people who do all the hard work on the rugby field in the forwards. I have met some decent people who have played in the backs but, obviously, I do not ever fully trust them!

            Sapper James Thomas Martin was on his first operational deployment as part of 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Task Group. He was a sapper from the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. I know Enoggera Army barracks well. I worked next door to them for six years. I hope that during the time he spent in Brisbane he enjoyed our wonderful Queensland weather and the food and the good times available there. I hope he had some great times while he was based in Queensland. He was born in Perth,

            in Sydney and began his Initial Employment Training as a combat engineer. On completion of his combat engineer course in August 2011, he was posted to the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment in Brisbane. On his arrival at the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, Sapper Martin became a member of the 7th Combat Engineer Squadron. He completed a number of additional courses including Combat Engineer High Threat Search, Communications and Weapon courses. Along with the rest of his squadron, Sapper Martin's force was concentrated in Townsville with 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in early 2012, in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan. Sapper Martin was an intellectual soldier who was a quick learner and adapted well to the Army environment. This was a man dedicated to serving his country. Even when his mates were thinking of withdrawing from training, he said, 'I won't give up this opportunity for anything,' and he did not.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was respected by his mates and was considered a loyal friend and comrade. A musically talented individual, he often played his bass guitar for his mates. For anyone that knows the music industry, and I say this as a former bass player, the bass player is just the guy that works in the background with not all the flair of an elite singer—leaving aside

The bass player does the solid work and keeps the music bumping along. So I am glad to hear that he played his bass for his mates. Like many Western Australians, he was also a follower of

Sapper Martin has been awarded the following honours and awards: the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF, and the Army Combat Badge. He is survived by his mother, Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother and sister Angus and Holly, and his grandparents Lucille and

            I now move on to Private Robert Poate, who was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Task Group and was also from 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment based in Brisbane, Queensland, at Enoggera. Private Poate was born in Canberra, in 1988, the bicentennial year. He enlisted in the Army in 2009. On completion of his basic and initial employment training, he was posted as a rifleman to 6
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
             RAR
            </a>
            . Private Poate was a highly qualified soldier, having completed specialist training as a protected mobility vehicle driver in 2010 and protected mobility vehicle commander in 2011. Knowing that he was going to Afghanistan, they would have been important skills to have.
           </p>
           <p>
            Private Poate was known for having outstanding leadership potential, which led to him completing a promotion course for corporal in 2011. He will be fondly remembered by his brothers by choice in 6RAR as a larrikin and an incredibly professional soldier—that mix that we often hear about Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen. Private Poate had a reputation for creating mischief without getting caught—such a very Australian tradition. He was very proud of his family; he was proud of his military service; and he was also proud of his Canberra origins, as so many people from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
             ACT
            </a>
            are. He was known for his ranga hair, which he so often defended as being strawberry blonde. While I am not so sure that our Prime Minister Gillard would ever try to defend her hair as being strawberry blonde, apparently that is what Private Poate did, and all power to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Private Poate was awarded the following honours and awards: Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp ICAT, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Australian Defence Medal, NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF, and the Infantry Combat Badge. Private Poate is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister Nicola. To you, your friends, your extended family, the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, and the 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, may I express my deepest sympathies on behalf of myself and all the people of Moreton that I represent. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.

            Unfortunately there is nothing new about war, but in Australia we are fortunate that most of the wars have been fought far from our shores,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
             World War II
            </a>
            aside. However, it is such events as these that have occurred in Afghanistan that remind us and bring home the horrors and tragedies of war and the importance of our armed forces. The 11th anniversary of September 11 is a poignant reminder of the daily challenges that Australian soldiers face in their hard but necessary work on behalf of all Australians.

            I know that the words of a politician who has not met these three brave soldiers would be only small comfort, but, as I said, not saying anything would not be appropriate. On such occasions there are more skilful wordsmiths than me, so I turn to the words of a poet. I turn to the words of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
             Paul Kelly
            </a>
            , one of Australia's greatest singer-songwriters. I was going to quote from one of his songs called
            <i>
             No
            </i>
            <i>
             you
            </i>
            , which might be appropriate. The final verse says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            I do not lack good companions
           </p>
           <p class="italic">

           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And every single sound says
           </p>
           <p class="italic">

            No you, no you, no you!
           </p>
           <p>
            But it was not as hopeful as I would like it to have been, so I turn instead to a poem by Paul Kelly that might offer some comfort. It is called
            <i>
             Smoke under the bridge
            </i>
            and it is about companionship. It says:

             Lance Corporal Milosevic, a 40-year-old Queensland outback raised and former Marist student, carried on a proud family tradition of military service, joining the army when he was 36. He became dedicated to the army, and was known for his strong sense of right and wrong which saw him rise quickly within its ranks. He was highly respected as a leader who put his soldiers ahead of himself. He was clearly a well-liked member of his regiment, with leadership and professional abilities which stood out in the unit, on the rugby field and on operations. Lance Corporal Milosevic is survived by his wife and their two children, for whom he was a loving and much loved husband and father. Those who knew him well said his family was always uppermost in his mind. This nation mourns with them today.

He was a quick learner who adapted well to the army environment. As a member of the 7th Combat Engineer Squadron, Sapper Martin completed a number of additional courses, including combat engineer, high-threat search and communications, and weapons courses. He was respected by his colleagues and, I understand, was considered a very loyal friend and comrade. He was also a keen musician, as the member for Moreton pointed out. Apparently he often played his bass guitar for his mates, even over in the field. He was also an avid follower of

             . 'Robbie' to his family and 'Poatey' to his mates, I understand, was a larrikin in the great Australian tradition—one of the boys, a young man who loved to laugh and gave as much as he got. He will be fondly remembered by his 'Brothers by Choice' in 6 RAR as an incredibly professional soldier, but also one with a reputation for creating mischief and getting away with it. He was well-known for having outstanding leadership potential and had completed a promotion course for corporal in 2011.

            <p>
             He was a highly qualified soldier with specialist training as a protected mobility vehicle driver and was a protected mobility vehicle commander. Private Poate is survived by his parents Hugh and Janny, and his sister Nicola. He was known to have been very proud of his family, his military service, his Canberra origins, and his red hair, as the member for Moreton also pointed out.

              These three brave men were murdered, as we know now, in an insider attack in Afghanistan on 29 August this year. It is important that we fully appreciate the ultimate sacrifice made by these brave men, who laid down their lives for us, for their country and for their mates. There can be nothing more terrible than when that life is lost at the hands of one whom we were there to assist.

              These three soldiers were from very different parts of Australia: Perth, Penrith and Canberra. They were men at different stages in their lives and in their careers as Australian soldiers, united in their service to the nation. These three brave sons will never be forgotten. As we know, Sapper James Martin hailed from Perth. He was a young soldier at the beginning of his career, a career that was so unjustly and unfairly cut short. In his youth he played cricket with Maylands Cricket Club and played local football with Bayswater Bears football club. He traded these teams for the much larger team—but still welcoming one—of the

              when he enlisted in 2011. He joined the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment in Brisbane. He was, as we have been told, an intelligent soldier, a quick learner and a bloke who embraced the challenge of service life—earning the respect of his mates as a loyal friend and comrade. Through his service and sacrifice he will always have the respect of his country. This was his first operational deployment. He is survived by his mother Suzanne, his younger siblings Angus and Holly, and his grandparents Lucille and Ralph. To his family and friends, I say his service is now part of Australia's story. It will never be underestimated nor will it be forgotten.

He was easy-going and had a natural charm—and, to those who knew that about him best, I send my sincere condolences. We know he had fine leadership skills both as a soldier and on the sporting field playing his much-loved rugby. His rise to the rank of Lance Corporal was quick, a testament to his talent and drive to succeed. He served in

              in 2010 and in Afghanistan in 2012. He is survived by his wife Kelly, his young daughters Sarah and Kate, his mother Heather and siblings Milan and Danica. Today, on the day of his funeral in Brisbane, we send our sympathies and condolences to his family, his friends and his comrades. He was a proud family man and a promising soldier with a very bright future so horribly cut short as a result of this very cowardly act. It is a future which his family and friends will miss every single day. As Lieutenant Mark Welburn of the 2nd/14th Light Horse said only last week, 'He is now and forever part of the Light Horse.'

              Today the family and friends of Private Robert Poate are coming together in Canberra at his old school, Canberra Grammar, to farewell a son, a brother and a mate. We pay tribute to him here in this place as well. Private Poate joined the Army in 2009, taking up the post as a rifleman in the 6th Battalion
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
               RAR

              . He was selected, as we now know, for promotion very early in his career.
             </p>
             <p>
              Within two years of enlistment, he had qualified as a protected mobility vehicle driver and commander, and his brothers by choice within the ADF and 6 RAR knew him as a professional soldier and, as we have heard a number of times now, quite a larrikin. I do not know if it was his red hair, but he was clearly a larrikin.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know it will be his family and friends who miss him most of all. The salute to his service and sacrifice in Australia's name can never fulfil or console for his loss. I know his mates in Afghanistan are back at work, now driving an armoured vehicle christened 'Poatey' in tribute to his work as a protector. Private Poate is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. I would like to thank them for raising such a selfless son, who gave his all for his country.
             </p>
             <p>
              These three men from different parts of Australia were united in their service. They were, indeed, brothers by choice. The loss of Sapper Martin, Lance Corporal Milosevic and Private Poate in such terrible circumstances has led many, as you would expect, to question our commitment in Afghanistan. Indeed, it is always right to question our actions and we should constantly assess and review our path, particularly when the price is so high. To go on blindly without questioning would be an affront to our system of democracy. At this terrible time, perhaps now more than ever, we must continue to be clear-sighted and focused. Our objective remains to prevent Afghanistan from being again a safe haven for terrorists. We will not be in Afghanistan for that much longer. The transition to an Afghan led security responsibility in Uruzgan has commenced and we are on track. We are there for a set purpose and a set time and should not and must not let our losses be in vain.
             </p>
             <p>
              All deaths, during peace time or war, are heartbreaking—indeed, to families, friends and comrades, shattering. Lives are shortened and loved ones are left behind to grieve and pick up the pieces. These three men loved the service, its challenges and opportunities, the comradeship and the community. Their deaths are on their own devastating, as they are doubly heartbreaking as they came at the hands of a coward. This is a difficult fact that will take a long time to reconcile, if ever it can be. At times like this, with grief so inconsolable, it would be easy to walk away. But, if we did so, we would simply compound our loss. We have always been a nation that sees things through, that keeps to its commitments and that gets the job done. We are a nation who honour the fallen by finishing what we started.
             </p>

              Sapper James Martin, Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic and Private Robert Poate will never be forgotten. Their names will sit alongside those other names on the walls of the

              , forever enshrined. Our condolences, our thoughts and our prayers are with their families, their friends and their mates. Their contribution and their sacrifice will be forever remembered.
             </p>
             <p>
              I want to conclude by reminding all of us that we can never imagine what it is like to serve in such a conflict. We can never imagine the courage that it takes to put that uniform on, carry a weapon and fight for your country. Those of us who have not served can never put ourselves in that place. So the respect we must have for all our serving men and women is, as it should be, very high. It underlines, I think, the courage, the conviction and the sacrifice that men and women such as these three brave soldiers are prepared to commit to when they put on that uniform and embark on an overseas mission.
             </p>
             <p>
              They know that the challenges are extreme, they know that the threats are extreme, but none of them should expect to be treated so poorly by a comrade or supposed colleagues—people who would shoot them down in such a cowardly way. These three very, very brave young men deserve forever our respect, our admiration and our love. Lest we forget.

              <p>
               What makes this tragedy so hard to digest is that these three soldiers were killed by the very person that they were trying to help. They were all shot by a rogue Afghan soldier whilst unwinding with beer after a long day of service. This cowardly internal attack is particularly disturbing because the enemy was walking within. I want to say a few words about each of these brave soldiers.

                Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate. These men, Australian soldiers on a mission to prevent the spread of terrorism and to bring peace and stability to the people of Afghanistan, died in the most tragic and heartbreaking way. My fellow members have spoken with great passion about the circumstances in which these men lost their lives. What has come across in the speeches that have been made today, and also from the sentiments in the community, is the devastation of the deaths and the fact that they were killed by someone they trusted, so there was an absolute breach of trust, which for any human being rocks you to the core.
               </p>
               <p>
                I met many soldiers in Afghanistan when I was there and I met those who were training the

                . They were very young men in their early 20s and they were classic Australian larrikin types, with a great sense humour and a bit naughty. What struck me about them was their absolute dedication and commitment to getting that army up to standard so that they could protect their own people and protect the stability of Afghanistan. For that breach of trust to occur, like it did under those circumstances, is just extraordinary, which is why I know it has rocked so many of my fellow colleagues here and the general community in Australia and throughout Canberra.

                Today I offer my condolences to the family and friends of these soldiers. In particular, I offer condolences from the people of Canberra to the family and friends of Private Robert Poate. Robert was born here in Canberra in 1988. He attended the

                 Canberra Grammar School
                </a>
                . I understand he was a young man who attended right throughout his schooling. He was a Grammar boy through and through. Robert enlisted in the Army in 2009 and, after completing his basic and initial employment training, was posted as a rifleman to the 6th Battalion

                The funeral of Private Poate, known as 'Poatey' to his mates, will be held in Canberra today. Robert will be laid to rest with full military honours at the Canberra Grammar School, which is so appropriate. I understand the senior schoolboys and staff will be lining the route of the funeral service at the beginning of the service. This is a very sad and emotional day for many people in Canberra, particularly those at Canberra Grammar School. It came as a deep blow to the Canberra Grammar community. I spoke to the Principal of Canberra Grammar, Dr Justin Garrick, last week. He explained to me how the community was incredibly devastated by this loss. As soon as they heard the news they had a special service at the school. Private Poate was a deeply loved and honoured member of that community and it has been a very deep blow to them. It is appropriate that he is honoured in such a way today at his former school, where he spent so much of his life.
               </p>
               <p>
                I was very moved by the words of Hugh and Janny Poate, Robert's parents, that were reported in today's
                <i>
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Times" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                </i>
                . Their son was known as a larrikin like so many Australian soldiers, with the ability to create mischief without getting caught—also like so many Australian soldiers. I gather Robert liked to stir a bit. The tributes to him tell a story of a dedicated soldier with a mischievous sense of humour and, of course, that famous strawberry blonde hair. Robert's parents have been overwhelmed by the tributes that have filled their home, many from Robert's mates and many from fellow Canberrans expressing their condolences.
               </p>
               <p>
                Janny Poate described her son as warm and loving and said he would probably be a bit embarrassed by all this attention. But this attention is more than deserved. Every soldier who gives their life to serve their country by helping to bring peace to people under threat deserves to be honoured by the parliament and by the people. As I mentioned before, I have been to Tarin Kot, Kandahar and Kabul as part of the Defence subcommittee and I saw firsthand the determination and focus of the Australian troops in their mission to eliminate terrorism from the region and create a peaceful and safe country for the people of Afghanistan. I also saw the loyalty and camaraderie of soldiers and I can only imagine the hurt and grief they are experiencing at the loss of three of their own. Our soldiers are a very tight-knit community and they are a very loyal bunch.
               </p>
               <p>
                We heard others talk of Robert Poate's role as part of Operation SLIPPER in Afghanistan where he tragically died at a patrol base in the Baluchi Valley. I am not going to go into any more detail about that but what I will say is that the loss of these three young soldiers is having a devastating impact on their families, their friends and the Defence community. The
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Defence Force
                </a>
                is an integral part of the Australian and Canberra communities, touching the lives of many people. While the ADF headquarters are here in Canberra, the strong Defence presence is respected by the entire community and we have a deep admiration for all our men and women who serve, which is why it is so hard to lose three of these great soldiers.
               </p>
               <p>
                Today, in particular, the thoughts and prayers of the Canberra community are with Robert Poate's parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. While I did not know Robert Poate personally, over the last week I have heard incredible stories and tributes which are testimony to his talent and commitment. On behalf of all Canberrans, we honour the sacrifice of Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Poate who lost their lives in such a tragic way and in a way that really does challenge our moral core. Lest we forget and may they rest in peace.

                 Today in this motion and in the one to follow, we are paying tribute to five outstanding Australian men—soldiers cut down in the line of duty and in the prime of their lives. It is difficult for any of us to make sense of our losses in Afghanistan, especially when those losses occur in circumstances such as happened on one day just a week or so ago. We cannot begin to understand the shattering effect on their families. Likewise, the Australian people have been struggling with these latest tragic circumstances.

                 . An accident and a betrayal have cost this country dearly. Together they mark the single highest loss of Australian troops since 1971 and the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
                  Vietnam War
                 </a>
                 . We have suffered losses in war before yet the losses of these five Australians, far from home, on the same day, came as a shock to all Australians. Our armed forces are the cream of the crop. They are engaged in dangerous places and under difficult circumstances but tragic news always comes hard. We must take solace in the knowledge that Australia's role in Afghanistan is making the world a safer place.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What our troops are doing on the ground in Afghanistan matters, and it is making a difference. These events illustrate just how dangerous that job is. There are never places where you can be assured of being safe or being protected from risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bringing home the troops before their mission is complete, as some have demanded, would dishonour all who have fallen and would make their sacrifice in vain. Our troops should come home as soon as the job is completed. There can be no doubt that the circumstances surrounding these tragedies are especially hard for all of us to come to grips with, especially the families, the loved ones and comrades most directly affected. An accident is regrettable, but when it comes with such a toll we must ask questions about how this could happen and what can be done to ensure it does not happen again. But betrayal is unforgivable. Questions of how this could happen and why, how it was organised and whether it just was one individual acting alone or at random are natural and we may never know the answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The bitter irony of these deaths is not lost on any of us. Our troops are in Afghanistan training and mentoring around 200 Afghan soldiers who provide security for the Afghan people. It is a rebuilding mission—a mission to put Afghanistan on a course to self-determination free from repression and to provide safety and security for the Afghan people. It is also a mission of the utmost strategic importance to Australia and our people. Terrorism knows no borders. Unchecked, we have seen it spread like a cancer and we have been touched by it through the loss of civilian Australians from the actions of such people. In Afghanistan we are striking at its very roots. Naturally that has been a military operation, but it is also a battle for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. The relationships being forged by our troops with the Afghan people are essential if we are to subdue and ultimately defeat the mentality that begets terrorism and breeds terrorists. Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper Martin, Private Poate, Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher knew that well. The aftermath of these tragic events reverberates still and, as the funerals are being held now across the country, we are reminded again of the personal sacrifice that has been involved for these men and their families.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Confidence is undermined, of course, when it comes to a rogue Afghan soldier slaying Australian troops. Perhaps that is their goal. Some commentators say that confidence betrayed means that it is misplaced, that we should not be there. I disagree. I think these events drive home to us all the harsh reality that our troops face every day and the bravery they display day in, day out, doing a job that needs to be done. This is a unique mission, with unique dangers from an unprecedented theatre of war. It is an important task with ramifications for quelling future terrorist activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That does not make these five deaths, and any that have become before, any easier to bear. My sincere hope is that those feeling the pain of these losses most deeply can find some consolation in knowing the sacrifice of their loved ones is creating a new, safer and freer Afghanistan and, in doing so, making Australia and the world also safer for us all. Their sacrifice is not in vain, but we grieve with their families on these tragic losses.

                  I rise to join with others on this condolence motion for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Corporal" rel="nofollow">
                   Lance Corporal
                  </a>
                  Stjepan (Rick)—or Milo, as he is known—Milosevic, who grew up in Quilpie in my electorate in Queensland, some 800 kilometres west of Brisbane. It is rather poignant that right at this very moment his private service is being conducted in Brisbane at
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College_Ashgrove" rel="nofollow">

                  </a>
                  . I spoke to people there knowing that I could not be there today—it was a private service and I respect the wishes of the family.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I am also here to pay my respects to Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate. It is not a coincidence but it is a reminder to us all that it was on the day of 11 September 2001 that the free world was attacked by terrorists using not weapons of war but civilian aircraft. So I think it serves all of us in this place at this time to be reminded of the events that have brought about our involvement in Afghanistan.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The three soldiers who are part of the condolence motion, 'Rick', James and Robert, were killed by a soldier that they trusted, an Afghani—but you cannot attach the word 'soldier' to that person; he is a coward. Our soldiers, our men, our
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                   Australian Defence Force
                  </a>
                  and we in Australia thought we could trust him, but the only word you could use to describe his actions is 'cowardly'. You could never use the word 'soldier' because soldiers are people of courage and of commitment and of values. Of course, they are prepared to do things that many of us perhaps would never do ourselves but they do them in the name of Australia as they serve under our flag, and I respect the professionalism that they display each and every day that they serve.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Our three soldiers about whom this condolence motion reflects on today were well trained. They were professional. They had the support of the parliament. It is one of those things that in this place when we commit soldiers, our Australian Defence Force personnel, to an operation overseas where they will be in harm's way I always have to reflect for a moment because we are, in fact, by the resolution of the parliament, committing troops to a theatre of a war or a peacekeeping operation where there are risks. In Afghanistan we have lost some 38 wonderful Australians who leave behind them family, friends, wives, partners and, as so often, children. When we do commit our troops to an operation overseas I have to think very carefully about how we do that to make sure that we are doing everything possible to support our troops when we commit their services through that resolution of the parliament—and it must be unwavering support.
                 </p>

                  Rick was born in

                   New South Wales
                  </a>
                  , where he grew up, and his very early education was in Quilpie, in Western Queensland, where his mother, his brother and other members of his family still live. In fact, his brother was recently elected to the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilpie_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">

                  </a>
                  . I know that Rick's death has hit the Quilpie Shire and Western Queensland particularly hard because it is a very close knit community, a small rural community with a very proud record of service to our nation. Many community members throughout time have served in the Australian Defence Force, in the Army,
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                   Air Force

                  or Navy, including during the

                   First World War

                  </a>
                  , Vietnam and Korea. So it is a very proud community, and I know this has had a significant effect not just on the Quilpie Shire but also on the surrounding shires—we have all felt it. When I got the news it was one of those things where you draw in your breath and think about another loss of life, another family in which children will grow up without a father—in this case, Rick's children. And, of course, there is Rick's wife, who is a mother, and his extended family.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Rick was one of those guys who went into the Army at quite a mature age, at 36. He was actually awarded for his initial training at Kapooka—an outstanding soldier award. That, to me, said a bit more about Rick. You can imagine the young guys saying, 'I think we are fitter than this fellow who is a bit older than us'—probably twice their age. Rick was a stocky guy and played a good game of football out there in Western Queensland and was loved by so many. His commitment and leadership shone through at his training at Kapooka. He was promoted to lance corporal—a further demonstration of his leadership qualities—and I know that he would have had an outstanding career in the Army. Another thing I want to say about Rick is that he was a family person. Family meant everything to him, as it does to his mother, his brothers and his sisters. It meant everything to him.

I will quote from the email that my constituent received from their son. In the email, their son said:

                  Coming to this country I had ideas about what I was doing and why I was doing it, but the incidents around this week have crystallised that understanding for me. I guess that you have heard about the 17 young people that were beheaded by the Taliban. They were in a province just a little distance from us here, just kids having a party whose only sin was to be playing music and dancing at that party. According to the news reports it is becoming their preferred form of social intimidation. Surely pure evil in is basest form.

                  Our guys are doing great work over here, giving the locals options to that oppressive regime, and hopefully slowing the movement of drugs into the western world. The main focus at the moment is working towards an orderly withdrawal, which I'm sure that your pleased about.

                  Ultimately we'll probably never know the difference that we, or more particularly those that have lost their lives or been injured over here, will have made. But there is the possibility that because were here one Afghani will have the chance, the courage, or just the idea to make a difference in this country. And if there is one, then there could be many and it could make such a difference in our world as a whole. I only know that if we weren't here they wouldn't have that chance.

                  Those comments I read are from an email from a soldier who is in the field, in theatre, and who knew Rick. He is from my constituency and his parents live there, but I want to protect their names. I do not want to necessarily link them to this, but I do want to thank them for the email that they have shared with me.

                  I think it is important to share those words in this condolence motion because they say a lot about those who are in the field. We as a nation and we as members of parliament are committed by resolution of the parliament to a task in Afghanistan we must see through.

                  Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic was known as 'Milo'. I am not quite sure how he got the name 'Milo', but there is a large sheep property out there called 'Milo'. Maybe he worked in shearing sheds in his holidays or something, because his parents had a business there. They had mail runs out of Quilpie and did a lot of building in and around Quilpie.

                  It is at times like these that we all reflect on our own lucky circumstances in Australia, but we also must remember that those who are lost—and we have lost 38 in Afghanistan—leave behind them families. It is to those that I address my deepest sympathies and condolences, not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my constituency of Maranoa and on behalf of the parliament. They will forever need our support as a nation. I know that for Rick's widow, now a war widow, and his children the work of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Legacy will be very important to support the family left behind. In this country, we must never diminish our financial support for those who are left behind. We have one of the best systems in the world. Regardless of budget surpluses or deficits, their service and support must always be paramount in the minds of all of us. To those families, and particularly to Rick's family, his mother—his father has passed away—his brother and his extended family, I say, 'My deepest condolence to you.' Rest in peace, Rick. We will never forget you.

I realise that the families, comrades and friends of these men may take a long time to bring themselves to read these condolences. It will not be easy for them to read these condolences because their grief, loss and anguish at this point are beyond measure, as the member for Maranoa reflected on. Some may never be able to read our words, such will be their loss. However, I offer my sincere condolences to Lance Corporal Milosevic's partner, Kelly, his daughters, Sarah and Kate, his mother, his brothers and his sisters. I offer my condolences to Sapper James Martin's mother, Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother and sister, Angus and Holly, and his grandparents, Lucille and

                  <p>
                   In this place, we do need to honour and respect these fine men and the sacrifice they have made for our nation, but we also need to honour and respect the sacrifice their families have also made for our nation and the ongoing sacrifice that they now will continue to make. I do not know how many others in this place have the same experience, but my mother was a war widow. My two older sisters and my mother lived all their lives with the sacrifice that they made, as well as the sacrifice of their husband and father.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So I know what is ahead for these families, and it will not be easy. As the member for Maranoa said, they will get wonderful support from Legacy, from the defence community and from their broader community. But nothing will change their loss, and they have to live with that on a daily basis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   These three specialist volunteers, these three brave men, will be remembered for their leadership, their dedication to their Army, but from what I understand mostly their love of life. All were on the very first tour of Afghanistan and all were highly respected and outstanding leaders. The loss of these soldiers is even more tragic given the treacherous nature of their death—something that I think enraged all Australians, no matter where they were when they heard this news. We all considered it such a cowardly, insider attack. We do know that we are in this battle to stay the course and to honour the sacrifice that has already been made, not to cut and run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Having been to Afghanistan and spent time with our troops on the ground in theatre, I understand firsthand what they believe about their mission and how committed they are to doing what needs doing in Afghanistan. They all understand the job that this parliament has asked them to do. I saw the work that they have done in the provisional reconstruction. In 2000-01 in Afghanistan there was no government, no health services, no basic governance and no education. They see firsthand what they are able to achieve on the ground. But the actions of our enemies, given the cowardly attack, will not define our actions nor change our attitude. That is something that has been reinforced across this parliament. We will keep doing what is right in the face of such a grievous wrong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In doing so, I believe we honour the legacy of not only these three brave Australian soldiers but all who have gone before them. Above all, though, these three men were loved by their families, and they will be mourned and missed forever. Their families have to live with this loss for the rest of their lives. I know that there have been requests to respect the family's privacy during this time, but I do hope there will come a time when their loved ones and those closest to them can bring themselves to read these condolence motions and understand that we in this place share their grief, and we simply want to show respect for those who have been lost.

Along with the rest of his squadron, Sapper Martin's force concentrated in Townsville with the 3RAR in early 2012 in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan.

Like all of Stjepan's mates who called him 'Milo' or 'Rick', Cedomir Milosevic was called 'Chad' and Miroslav Risojevic was called 'Rizzo'. I can only tell you one thing on behalf of all of them: if you have a bloke by the name of Milosevic in your team, you are going to go okay; he is going to be tough, he is going to go hard at the ball and he will take no prisoners—he will be hard at it.

                    3RAR has only been in Townsville for a short time. We are part of a very big defence family and we feel for the people who have copped this loss. We feel it as a community. For those who are wounded, we need to help you with your recovery; we need to understand what is going to happen to you when you come home and the problems you are going to face. And we need to look at the way that our allowances and pay are done for these people. There are the soldiers who accompany home the bodies and there are the wounded men who come home and go to hospital but want to move out of hospital to be with their families. All of their allowances and tax-free benefits must be looked at to support these people as best we possibly can. They have enough to worry about.

                    The overall command of the Australians in Afghanistan is now under the control of Major General Stuart Smith, who is the immediate past brigadier at the brigade in Townsville. He is the son of a Vietnam casualty. He knows first-hand. Those of us who have been to the funerals will understand the grief that has been shown by the families who have suffered these losses. The Defence Force Welfare Association and Legacy will do a great job for these families, but it is cold comfort for someone who has lost a family member. We just had a ball in Townsville to raise money for Legacy. I did the auction. We raised some fantastic money and everyone had a great night. It is these things that bring it home very quickly.

These guys understand that they have a role to play. We have professional soldiers and a very professional Army. Lest we forget.
