       <p>
        This year, 2021, has been a challenging year, to say the least.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Christmas" rel="nofollow">
         This Christmas
        </a>
        is sure to be difficult for those doing it tough, which is why it is more important than ever to think of those who are less fortunate than us. There are wonderful and selfless people in every community who are looking out for others at this time, but I would like to highlight just one organisation in Bennelong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Christian Community Aid, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCA" rel="nofollow">
         CCA
        </a>
        for short, works in the greater Eastwood area to ensure locals have what they need throughout the year. They offer food services, English services and activities for the isolated and the elderly. Through the pandemic, as local needs have become more pressing, CCA have stepped up and done incredible work to ensure that no-one is left behind. At Christmas time they organise hamper deliveries for locals, and I am delighted to say I will be joining them to assist with the packing in the next few weeks. When I'm there, I will also be congratulating them on a federal grant they received recently of $20,000 to go towards an adventure play space for children from disadvantaged families. Thank you to Heather Pinto and her dedicated team at CCA for making sure nobody is left behind this Christmas, and thank you to everyone out there who may also be looking out for others at Christmas.
