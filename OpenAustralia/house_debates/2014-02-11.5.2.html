        On behalf of the

         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        , I present the committee's report entitled
        <i>
         Review of the listing of Jabhat al-Nusra and the re-listing of six terrorist organisations
        </i>
        ; and

       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”The report reviews the initial listing of the terrorist organisation known as Jabhat al-Nusra and the re-listing of seven previously listed terrorist organisations under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulations listing these organisations were tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 12 November and 2 December 2013. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the committee's review of the regulations tabled on 12 November requires the committee to report to the parliament by today, 11 February 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        Madam Speaker, I will now take this opportunity to outline the committee's findings in relation to each organisation. As mentioned, this is the first listing of Jabhat al-Nusra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jabhat al-Nusra plans and conducts attacks in Syria against individuals and groups perceived to be supporting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Its attacks include security and military targets using improvised explosive devices (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
         IED
        </a>
        s), sniper and small-arms attacks, as well as kidnapping and torture. Jabhat al-Nusra targets urban areas, resulting in indiscriminate civilian attacks. The group has been responsible for numerous attacks since it announced its existence via a video statement on 6 January 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of particular concern to the committee were reports of Jabhat al-Nusra's recruitment of Australians to fight in Syria, as well as the suggestion that it is deliberately recruiting and training foreigners to go back to conduct terrorist attacks in their own countries. The committee therefore supports the listing of Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation and does not recommend disallowance of the regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to the organisations being re-listed, this is the fifth re-listing of al-Qaeda,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">
         Jemaah Islamiah
        </a>
        , al-Qaeda in the Lands of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Maghreb" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic Maghreb
        </a>
        , Jamiat ul-Ansar and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Sayyaf_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Abu Sayyaf Group
        </a>
        ; and the first re-listing of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In each case, the committee was satisfied that the groups continue to engage in terrorist activities which could be a threat to Australians or Australian interests either here in Australia or overseas. The committee therefore supports their ongoing listing as terrorist organisations and does not recommend disallowance of the regulation for each of these groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to particularly mention the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        of Iraq and the Levant. This group has been listed since 2005 under different names including, most recently, Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        In December 2013 the government took the decision to re-list the organisation under the name Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The committee was informed that this was to reflect the expansion of the group's activities into Syria, with the change of name not reflecting a change in leadership, membership or methods of operation. Described to the committee as 'one of the world's deadliest and most active terrorist organisations', the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant conducts daily, often indiscriminate attacks. It targets crowds and public gatherings to maximise casualties and publicity. Of additional concern to the committee were reports that the group actively recruits Australians who have travelled to Syria to fight.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee notes that the regulation reflecting the change of name to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is to be tabled in the House this Thursday. The committee supports the re-listing of this organisation and does not recommend disallowance of the regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity to thank my fellow committee members for making themselves available to complete this review in the short period between the establishment of the committee and the end of the disallowance period today. I also acknowledge the support of the secretariat in ensuring this work was done in a timely manner. I commend the reports to the House.
