        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the government's response to the Harper competition policy review? How important is it that Australia's governments work together to find new ways to update our economy and promote growth in jobs?

              <p>
               The question goes to the Harper review, and delivering better services and more choice for Australian consumers and working with the states and territories are what will drive growth and jobs in the economy. Working together with the states and territories to drive growth is what our response to the Harper review is all about. It is resetting the agenda on competition policy and setting out agenda for productivity growth over the next 10 years, because we know on this side of the House that we need to drive productivity growth to ensure that the real incomes of Australians are improved and the earnings of Australia are improved against the headwinds that we know are in place in front of our economy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now our economy is transitioning and it does need these productivity enhancements in the years ahead to ensure that we can drive growth. That was acknowledged by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                Reserve Bank
               </a>
               governor only in the last 24 hours. He acknowledged that the transition that is taking place in our economy is underway, and he said in his speech:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               A number of data points over recent months suggest that prospects for firmer conditions in the non-mining economy are improving. Business surveys indicate that firms report conditions to be, if anything, above their long-term average in some key sectors. Firms seem to have stepped up their hiring. Job vacancies have been increasing, hours worked have been increasing and employment growth, even before the most recent month's data, had strengthened noticeably over the past year. Labour force participation has risen, and the unemployment rate has been stable. This is supporting income growth as the terms of trade decline works its way through the economy.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the economy is growing, and it is growing in spite of those headwinds. What we have had in the reaction to the government's announcements in response to the Harper inquiry is the

              <p>
               The Ai Group says it will:

              <p class="italic">
               … usher in a range of measures to boost national productivity, investment, and economic opportunities for Australian businesses …
