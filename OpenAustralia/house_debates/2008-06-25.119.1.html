       <p>
        I rise to update the House on a promise that was made by the then opposition in around July last year on a major piece of infrastructure in my electorate: the missing-link pipeline between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_Creek_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Mangrove Creek Dam
        </a>
        and Mardi Dam. While the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        receives a lot of rainfall, people may not know that we have been on level 4 water restrictions now for many years. In fact, midway through last year our water supply levels dropped to only 13 per cent; we were reaching absolute crisis point.
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem that we have on the Central Coast is as a result of the design of our water storage areas. We have a small dam, the Mardi Dam, which is close to the coast and constantly close to being 100 per cent full, but our main storage dam, Mangrove Creek Dam, is currently storing less than 10 per cent of its capacity. That has meant level 4 water restrictions. This is a problem that has been in existence for many years—in fact, for some decades. After a long 18-month campaign, which we ran locally, we got the then opposition leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        to come to the electorate. He announced that, if elected, he would provide $80.3 million to fund a pipeline between these two dams. Subsequently, the then government matched that particular promise, so it was a win for the Central Coast—whoever won the last election, this vital piece of infrastructure would be constructed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In constructing the pipeline, there are difficulties regarding the actual route of the pipeline between the two dams, particularly in ensuring that the impact on roads, existing rivers and private landholders is kept to a minimum. At this stage, we can report that eight out of the nine stages have been designed and are ready to go. There is one stage left, which has some geographical challenges. The council are looking at whether they will tunnel through hills and mountains for that last stage or go over private land. At the moment, it looks like it will go very close to a residential house, and there is further consultation underway with that particular landowner in relation to that. I can report that this absolutely vital piece of infrastructure is proceeding on time. Eight stages of the nine are ready to go. When completed in 2010, the Central Coast water supply will be secure for the first time.
