         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         is aware of the report on manufacturing in Melbourne's North and the challenges being faced in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
          North Melbourne
         </a>
         and other regions affected by structural change. The Government is also aware of the Census data on the share of manufacturing employment for the electorates of Wills and Calwell.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In relation to reskilling opportunities, the Government has in place a $476 million Industry Skills Fund (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISF" rel="nofollow">
          ISF
         </a>
         ) to address Australia's skills demand and that will help Australian businesses access training so that they are better placed to succeed in a rapidly changing economy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It will deliver 200,000 training places and training support services over four years, starting in January 2015.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Fund targets Small and Medium Enterprises (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
          SME
         </a>
         s), including micro businesses (0 to 4 employees), which plan to up-skill and re-skill their workforces to better position themselves for growth opportunities.
