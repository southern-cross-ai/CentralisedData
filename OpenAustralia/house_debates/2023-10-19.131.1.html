        The electorate of Holt is one of the youngest in the nation. Over one in four in my electorate are under the age of 14—the highest rate of young people in the country. It is self-evident that education is crucial to my community. In my first speech in this chamber, I referenced a quote by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Monash" rel="nofollow">
         Sir John Monash
        </a>
        , who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The best hope for Australia is the ballot box and good education.
       </p>
       <p>
        While our community has evolved significantly from the time when he said this, the 1930s, the principle is forever true. While I remember the area I now represent being nothing but paddocks, it has now become a thriving and growing community. Thus, our need to invest in education has become more and more important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud that the Albanese Labor government, particularly the Minister for Education,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Clare" rel="nofollow">
         Jason Clare
        </a>
        , recognise this need for investment and have put education front and centre of their priorities. Schools in my electorate are fortunate to have secured $125,000 for upgrades and refurbishments through the federal government's Schools Upgrade Fund. They are excited to utilise this funding in a way that will assure the best possible outcomes for students—our nation's future.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndhurst_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Lyndhurst Primary School
        </a>
        and Cranbourne Park Primary School will undergo classroom refurbishments to provide the best possible learning environments for our children. Devon Meadows Primary School will oversee the upgrade of essential
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        equipment to ensure our kids will have the skills of the future. Cranbourne Carlisle Primary School will benefit from the construction of new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        learning spaces, fostering a dynamic and modern learning environment. Cranbourne West Primary School is set to receive the installation of shade structures, which will provide for the safety and comfort of our students.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, by partnering with the Victorian government, we have continued to deliver the essential services and infrastructure our community requires. In this light, I had the honour of attending the opening of new facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Peter's College
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Francis" rel="nofollow">
         St Francis
        </a>
        de Sales, Lynbrook recently. Investment in education is an investment in our future. As Holt's voice in the House of Representatives, I will keep advocating for the education support that my community needs.
