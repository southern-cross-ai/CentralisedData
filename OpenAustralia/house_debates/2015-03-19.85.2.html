        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will he take his plans for $100,000 degrees to the next election? Will he take his plans for $6,000 cuts to family payments to the next election? Will the Prime Minister take his plans for $80 cuts to weekly pensions to the next election whenever it is?

         What this government will be taking to the next election is a very strong record of achievement. The carbon tax is gone and every household is $550 a year better off. The mining tax is gone and Australia is once more a safe place to invest. Roads are being built right around Australia, except where the state cohorts of the members opposite want to say no to the jobs and economic opportunity that new roads will bring. And the boats have stopped. We will have a very strong policy platform to take to the next election. What will Labor's platform be? Bring back the carbon tax, bring back the mining tax and bring back the people smugglersâ€”that is what Labor will take to the next election.
        </p>

         This government, as I have constantly said, is open for business. And because this country, under this government, is open for business our economy is strengthening. Economic growth in our first year is 25 per cent higher than economic growth in Labor's last year. Jobs growth in our first year was three times jobs growth in Labor's last year. Over the last 12 months exports are up seven per cent, housing approvals are up nine per cent and retail sales are up four per cent. Confidence is returning to our country. And why wouldn't confidence return to our country when you have got low and stable interest rates, a competitive and stable exchange rate, the lowest petrol prices in years and, thanks to the policies of this government, the biggest fall in power prices on record. So there will be a platform of competent administration, of delivery, of commitments and prosperity, upon which this government will base its appeal to the Australian people.
