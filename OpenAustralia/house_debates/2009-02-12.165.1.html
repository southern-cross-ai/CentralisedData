        Don Lindner was particularly renowned for his sensational high marking. In speaking at his funeral, South Australia’s greatest footballer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie_Robran" rel="nofollow">
         Barrie Robran
        </a>
        , remarked that, in his opinion, Don Lindner was the best high marker to play the sport. I know that anyone who has seen Don Lindner play would not disagree with that statement.

        Football today has changed markedly from the way it was played in the 1950s and 1960s, so it is very difficult to draw comparisons between footballers of that era and footballers of today. I have no doubt, however, that if there had been a national football competition similar to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        when Don Lindner was playing, his would be a household name not only in South Australia but throughout Australia. Don Lindner was a dominant character both on the field and off the field. To quote
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Cornes" rel="nofollow">
         Graham Cornes
        </a>
        in the Adelaide

        on 3 January 2009:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Never was there a character larger than life itself, more confident in his ability and more striking in his persona … You knew when Don was in the room.
       </p>
       <p>
        People looked up to Don Lindner, both literally and metaphorically. To many he was affectionately referred to ‘Sir Donald’ or simply ‘the Don’. Off the field, Don Lindner was a successful livestock agent, managing the family business known as the House of Lindner. Through that business, he also became a South Australian identity in the livestock and farming communities. He continued to manage the business until the end. It became clear from listening to the many speakers at his funeral service that Don Lindner enjoyed life to the full and, equally, brought so much enjoyment to others. He entertained football fans and inspired young footballers, including the great Barrie Robran, who I understand went to North Adelaide from Whyalla in 1966 as a young, promising footballer to play with his then football hero.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday, 9 January, Don Lindner was given a fitting send-off with around 1,500 people, including many distinguished South Australians, attending his funeral service at
