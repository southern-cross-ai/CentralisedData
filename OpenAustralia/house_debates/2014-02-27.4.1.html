        the Honourable Quentin Bryce AC,

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        General Cosgrove will be sworn in as Governor-General on 28 March 2014. Section 3 of the Constitution prevents the Governor-General's salary from being altered during his term of office. As such, the salary must be set prior to the appointment of General Cosgrove as Governor-General on 28 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Governor-General serves at the Queen's pleasure, it is usual to serve for approximately five years. As such, it is necessary to set the next Governor-General's salary at a level appropriate for the duration of this term.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been longstanding practice to set the Governor-General's salary with reference to that of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court. The proposed salary is based on a forecast of the Chief Justice's salary over the next five years using wages growth projections. I note that the Chief Justice's salary is determined annually by the Remuneration Tribunal, a body that is independent of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In setting an appropriate salary, the Governor-General designate requested that regard be given to the Commonwealth-funded military pension he will be entitled to receive during his term in office. This is consistent with precedent established by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Deane" rel="nofollow">
         Sir William Deane
        </a>
        in 1995 and continued most recently for Her Excellency Ms Bryce in 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed salary of $425,000 per annum therefore takes account of General Cosgrove's military pension.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
