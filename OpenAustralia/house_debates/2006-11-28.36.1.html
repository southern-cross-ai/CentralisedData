        My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Minister, what is the government doing to ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of international research?

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I note her deep interest in science and research, particularly in biofuels research—she has the largest ethanol plant in Australia in her electorate.

        <p>
         The Howard government is committed to providing our best and brightest researchers with world-class research facilities. Yesterday I announced that half a billion dollars would be invested in world-class infrastructure so that our scientists and researchers can continue to focus their world competitive research in areas of national importance—for example, climate change, biofuels and the development of new drugs and therapies. This will mean that our researchers will have access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. It will also assist them in continuing fundamental research in life sciences, environmental sciences and the physical sciences including astronomy, in which we are a world leader.
        </p>
        <p>
         This strategy has been developed over the last 12 months. The research community has come together to collaborate and focus on priorities for research infrastructure in Australia. Some of the projects that will be funded include two pilot projects for biofuels research, a genetic bank for developing better crops for Australian farmers, a system for monitoring our oceans so that we can better predict weather patterns and a national network of medical imaging facilities. Instead of denigrating our scientific organisations, which is the pastime of the Labor Party, the Howard government—

           ? Yes, you do. The Howard government is focused on ensuring that our scientists and researchers are supported. In fact, this year the Australian government is investing nearly $6 billion in science and research—that is, the Howard government is focused on ensuring that our scientists and researchers are supported. In fact, this year the Australian government is investing nearly $6 billion in science and research. That is a 56 per cent increase on the funding that Labor put into science and research when they were in office.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the decade from 2001, the Howard government will have invested over $50 billion in science and research in this country. That is the largest investment by any Australian government at any time in our history.
