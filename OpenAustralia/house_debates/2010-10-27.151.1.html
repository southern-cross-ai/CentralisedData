         As I said earlier during the debate on the second reading, this is an uncontroversial bill and the opposition do support regulatory reform of the TGA. The opposition have not sighted the government amendments. This was a bill which was only introduced in the first or second sitting week of the parliament, and we are not in a position to comment, having not even seen the amendments. On what the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing has said, they sound uncontroversial. If they have been circulated I do not have a copy in front of me. I just make the point that this bill was referred to the Main Committee as an uncontroversial bill, but the opposition are not in a position to provide any comment on the government’s amendments to its own bill—for which there was considerable time to have properly drafted when it was first introduced—because we have not sighted the government amendments.

          I extend my apologies to the member for Boothby. I had understood that that process was underway, but obviously there has been an issue in terms of communication around those amendments. I am just seeking to make sure that you now have available, via the clerks, a copy of those amendments. Obviously you may want to take some time to look at them.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government amendments to this bill, as I stated, are not controversial. They are around the issue of product information—the document that contains important technical information. They are about making sure that that product information cannot be changed without the approval of the Secretary to the

           Department of Health and Ageing
          </a>
          . The government amendments also make changes to the act relating to the business process reforms, which have been widely canvassed in the Australian community. I understand that the opposition is aware of the business reforms that have been undertaken by the TGA and I am quite sure it would have received representations from industry around those as well because it has been a lengthy and ongoing process in which a large number of consultations have been undertaken. There is also just a small clarification of the operation of section 9D of the act, which relates to requests for the variation of entries in the Australian Register of

          and how they can be made.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I said, these amendments are not controversial. They are amendments that have been supported by industry and they have certainly been supported by consumer groups as well. I certainly think that they should be supported by the opposition.

             Under our standing orders, we do not have the capacity to resolve a question here if there is dissent. So, if there is a vote to be taken—and I realise that there has been no decision made on that yet—it will be taken in the main chamber. Because there is opposition to this particular proposal, it will be referred to the main chamber, where it will be dealt with. Does the parliamentary secretary wish to make a comment?

              Yes. I am in the hands of the chair on this. There is a possibility that we could adjourn the matter here in the Main Committee and we will provide the opposition with some time to scrutinise those amendments.

                Again, my apologies; I thought that had been the case. If that is possible, that may be another pathway forward to allow the opposition some time. I am in the hands of the whips a little bit here too to see whether we could then bring that on again later in the Main Committee, if that is possible.

                 That is possible, but the effect is that it would be picked up at the same position of debate in the main chamber, so it is probably better to refer it to the main chamber. I am referring the
