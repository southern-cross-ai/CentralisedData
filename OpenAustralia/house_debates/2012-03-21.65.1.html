         Special Minister of State

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. It reflects an interest that many members of parliament have in the integrity of our electoral system. It reflects a concern that this parliament has had since 1984, 28 years ago, the first time we legislated to create a disclosure regime for political donations—a regime that was put in place to ensure transparency, a regime that was put in place to ensure integrity and a regime that was put in place because it acknowledges the fundamentally important role played by individuals and organisations who wish to contribute to the political debate.
        </p>
        <p>
         On my side of politics we have trade unions that make donations to political parties. Their donations are disclosed. I was asked in particular about donations of $1 million, and it is of course the case that in the last election the Greens party did receive a donation of $1.6 million from Mr Greg Wood. But I was caused earlier this week following media reports to peruse the total contributions of other individuals too. The House may wish to be aware that the contributions of individuals of substantial net worth are now at a point that should be brought to the attention of this place. High net worth individuals of course are at liberty to make decisions to support our political parties and our political processes, as is their wont. I was made aware that last year Mr Clive Palmer made a contribution in the order of $1 million to the coalition. I am aware that the total contribution now to the coalition from individuals—

          Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I refer you again to page 553 of the

           Practice

          and the holding of previous Speakers that there should be no contrast between government and opposition. I would remind the minister that the Western Australian Labor Party received $160,000 in donations from Mr Palmer.

            While on the subject of the core of the question, which is individuals of high net worth making contributions, the total contribution to the coalition now from Mr Palmer is over $4 million—in the last few years, $4 million. I make the observation that never in the history of our parliament have we had an allegation of corrupt or inappropriate behaviour from any of us in this place about donors to the political system. I do make this observation.
