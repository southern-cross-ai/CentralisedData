        I rise to thank the

        </a>
        Labor leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Foley" rel="nofollow">
         Luke Foley
        </a>
        , for visiting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        last Friday and announcing that, if elected, New South Wales Labor will repeal Premier Baird's anti-protest laws. Luke Foley made the announcement whilst meeting with representatives of the Knitting Nannas, Lock the Gate and Gasfield Free Northern Rivers in Lismore.
       </p>
       <p>
        These new laws have been brought in by Premier Mike Baird. He brought them in last month. They were strongly opposed by New South Wales Labor at every stage, and they prevent legitimate, peaceful protest by law-abiding members of the community. Activities that were once completely legal now expose farmers and groups such as the Knitting Nannas and the wider community to jail for up to seven years for acting to protect their land, water and food security. In addition, further reform by the Baird government has effectively reduced the fines faced by large mining companies for exploring or mining without permission.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a government in New South Wales that sides with corporate interests and not the community. But Labor certainly sides with the community. That is why New South Wales Labor have announced that they will repeal that anti-protest legislation as a priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes that the Baird government have brought in are particularly directed at community protests against coal seam gas and other unconventional mining projects, especially on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast_of_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast of New South Wales
        </a>
        . We as a community have been very vocal and very outspoken about our objections to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSG" rel="nofollow">
         CSG
        </a>
        mining and other unconventional gas mining, so these laws are designed specifically to stop our community raising our voices and concerns about it. In fact, all of the North Coast Nationals voted for this harsh, draconian legislation, but New South Wales Labor stands with the community and will repeal these anti-protest laws if elected.
