       <p>
        On 14 and 15 June, as part of my responsibilities under the Defence subcommittee of the

        </a>
        standing committee, I travelled to Rockhampton to inspect exercises Hamel and Sea Raider underway at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        training area. I was accompanied by the committee defence liaison officer, Wing Commander Jacqui Carswell and

        the committee secretary.
       </p>

        We were greeted at

        and escorted to our waiting

        -90 helicopter. We joined a number of ADF personnel transferring to the Army base at Shoalwater Bay, where we were briefed about Exercise Hamel. I was greeted by Major General Paul McLachlan, who had read all about my announcement last Wednesday of Praesidium Global of $2 million for the supply of four unmanned ground vehicles. The Army are keenly awaiting the supply of these tremendous vehicles, constructed in Caloundra in my electorate of Fisher, so that they can put them through their paces during operation Talisman Sabre next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a short drive from the Army headquarters in a magnificent Bushmaster, we were off again in an MRH-90 headed for

        <i>

        </i>
        and her sister ship HMAS
        <i>
         Adelaide
        </i>
        comprise the Navy's class of large air-capable amphibious assault warships, designated as landing helicopter docksâ€”

        . To date, they are the largest vessels ever operated by the Royal Australian Navy and a vital asset in the pursuit of the nation's current force protection strategy.

        is capable of many roles but is primarily assigned to the conduct of amphibious operations, along with tactical logistic support, command and control support, and military support operations.

       <p>
        Unfortunately, I had to leave the
        <i>
         Canberra
        </i>
        at 13:30, just a few hours before her embarked forces of 900 infantry were to leave by helicopter and landing craft. Two years of planning had to come to a crescendo on that day and the ship was abuzz with excitement. This would be the largest amphibious assault, albeit as an exercise, undertaken by the ADF using Australian-owned resources. On 15 June, Australia joined the ranks of only six countries around the world with capacity for amphibious assault. The men and women serving onboard HMAS

        and
        <i>

        and
        <i>

        </i>
        did our country proud, and it showed to our friends and allies and, indeed, the world, just how capable she is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to particularly acknowledge the following service men and women for making our trip to the
        <i>

        so memorable: the flight crew on the MRH-90; Major General Paul McLachlan; Brigadier Ben James AM; Captain Ashley Papp; Colonel Matt Sieber of the
