        Madam Deputy Speaker, I'm disappointed that I'm trying to pay tribute to volunteers but members of this government are being disrespectful to them.

          Madam Chair, it's disrespectful not only to this chamber but also to the hardworking volunteers. As the

          like to deride them, I will congratulate them.
         </p>
         <p>
          This event has grown to be one of the most popular family events anywhere in the south-west of Brisbane, and it continues to go from strength to strength, which means record crowds year after year. Not content with just providing a fantastic local event, the 4074 Family Fun Day reaches out to charities that are perhaps a little lesser known but are a huge support to many in our community. This year the Family Fun Day was proud to support the Logan House Fire Support Network and DanDaLion Friends.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just as in previous years, the 4074 Family Fun Day featured rides, market stalls, food, face painting, an animal farm, kids' games, competitions, raffles, music and, of course, the famous annual Just Poppy's Burger Eating Championship. I'm proud to say that I gave it my best shot in the qualifying rounds last week, with a bit of practice, but I was no match for other locals who powered through and competed in the main event on Sunday. They included men's winner, Nick Robson, who polished off his burger in two minutes and two seconds. The event also, importantly, raised $2,000 for the Charleville drought relief fund. My congratulations again to Lisa Baillie and the 4074 Family Fun Day team.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also want to congratulate the latest round of Local Sporting Champions grant recipients. After receiving applications from far and wide across our community, I was pleased to approve grants of between $500 and $700 for 31 aspiring athletes to chase their dreams at state, national and even world championship events. They included grants for Tom Gillett, to compete in the 10- to 12-year-old national

          championships; Mercedes Siganto, to compete at the 2018 School Sport Australia swimming championships; and Zac Dos Santos, to compete at the under-13 state hockey championships. Their dedication and commitment to sport cannot be underestimated. While juggling a full-time study load at school, many of these students finish their daily school routine only to complete hours of rigorous training. I commend each and every one of them for their endeavours and I particularly congratulate their parents, families and friends who support them to make sure they get the best from themselves on the sporting fields.
