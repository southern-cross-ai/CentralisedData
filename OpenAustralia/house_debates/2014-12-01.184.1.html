        My electorate of Hasluck in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        is lucky enough to have men's sheds in the Foothills, Gosnells, Kalamunda and Hillside regions. Men's sheds are an established part of the health infrastructure to improve men's health and wellbeing by providing welcoming spaces for men to spend time together or take time out. The determination and strength of the Hasluck community has recently seen the construction of a new community shed in the Walridge Country Estate for retirement living in Gosnells.
       </p>
       <p>
        The local men's shed gave considerable support to the construction of the new shed. The Mundaring and Foothills Men's Shed provided support and advice. The Kalamunda Men's Shed provided tools and equipment. Members of the HillSide Church Men's Shed assisted with the construction of the shed, and two local branches of the

        </a>
        also provided a $5,000 grant. The shed was also constructed with the assistance of four outstanding residents of Walridge Country Estate:    Mr Bruce Wilson, Mr John Lathwell, Mr Kevin Ryan and Mr Richard Holmwood. Sadly, Mr Bruce Wilson did not live to see the completion of the shed. Bruce was well-known as a lone wolf who would come in to work on the shed in the wee hours of the morning. He would always ensure he returned home in time to make his wife, Bev, a cup of tea with her breakfast.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the launch, Bev unveiled a plaque on the shed that was dedicated to Bruce. I commend the community's initiative on the construction of the Woolridge Community Shed. Strong local communities for aged care in Hasluck is a key priority, and knowing that the community is behind me gives me great comfort.
