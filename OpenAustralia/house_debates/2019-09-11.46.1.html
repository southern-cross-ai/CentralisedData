       <p>
        As both the federal member for Burt and shadow minister for WA resources, I'm happy to celebrate the introduction of Australia's first nationally recognised qualifications in automation in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . The Certificate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        in Autonomous Workplace Operations will be introduced to the South Metropolitan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        curriculum and piloted by a group from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto" rel="nofollow">
         Rio Tinto
        </a>
        iron ore workforce from later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am especially proud to share that this program will be piloted for year 11 and 12 students in selected high schools across the state, including Burt's own Cecil Andrews College. Over the last few years as a federal MP, I have had the opportunity to observe the fantastic work of Cecil Andrews College in my electorate, which is leading the way in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        education. They're the only P-TECH school in WA and have had some fantastic success nationally, competing in robotics competitions as well as leading the way in direct industry engagement at a high-school level. It's programs like these that will train the next generation of miners and explorers.
       </p>
       <p>
        These new certificate courses will be the first to provide education pathways to jobs in autonomous operations. As the shadow minister for WA resources, I can't wait to see how these talented students will help shape the future of the mining and other resources industries in Western Australia. They continue to be at the forefront of training and innovation in our nation. I look further to working closely with the South Metropolitan TAFE, Cecil Andrews College and Rio Tinto on this exciting new educational endeavour, which will benefit our whole community.
