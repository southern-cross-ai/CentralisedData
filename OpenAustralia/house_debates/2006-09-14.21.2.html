         I want to take this opportunity, having seen this motion on the

         , to have my say on behalf of the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         , because
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Shoalwater Bay
         </a>
         is part of the electorate of Capricornia. The use of Shoalwater Bay and the prospect of increased defence activities in Shoalwater Bay following the signing of the agreement with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         armed forces are matters of interest and concern to people in my electorate. I appreciate that the works proposed under this motion—the exercise control building and the Urban Operations Training Facility—will not in themselves cause any great impact on Shoalwater Bay, and I understand that was the conclusion of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
          Public Works
         </a>
         Committee following their hearings in Rockhampton earlier this year. But it is important to understand that this project will take place in the context of the proposed expansion of use of Shoalwater Bay as part of the Joint Combined Training Centre project.
        </p>
        <p>
         The main concerns of people in Central Queensland relate to the pressure that the increased activities will put on our local infrastructure. The Livingston Shire Council in particular has made this point on many occasions to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         . We understand that the decisions concerning Shoalwater Bay made by the federal government are made with reference to matters of national interest, but we ask that, in doing so, the defence department and the federal government take into account the interests of the local community as well. When they talk about expanding exercises in the Shoalwater Bay training area there has to be a recognition that that puts extra pressure on the infrastructure surrounding Shoalwater Bay, particularly the road infrastructure that is left for Livingston Shire Council to maintain. The council and ratepayers face increased pressure to maintain that infrastructure when it comes under greater use from military exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other concerns that have been raised relate to environmental matters. Shoalwater Bay is a very special place. It does have environmental significance, and it is very important to the people of Central Queensland that its environmental values are preserved. There have been concerns about the types of weapons that may be used during military exercises in Shoalwater Bay. I again call on the defence department to do everything it can to work with the communities adjacent to Shoalwater Bay and to do the testing that has been requested by those communities in order to allay their fears and give them reassurance that the water and soil around and within Shoalwater Bay are not unduly affected by the military activities that go on there.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a great deal of support within Central Queensland for the defence forces that come to use Shoalwater Bay and I would hate to see the relationship between the defence forces and the local community break down through lack of communication or a feeling that somehow the communities surrounding Shoalwater Bay are being taken for granted. There is good support within Central Queensland for what goes on there and it is important that Defence respects the interests of the local people in using Shoalwater Bay in ways that enhance our national security. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to have my say on this. As I said, it does not appear that this particular project will have any great impact on Shoalwater Bay, but it has to be seen in the context that the use of Shoalwater Bay is being expanded.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to make one point arising from the Public Works Committee report which also came up at the committee’s hearing in Rockhampton. In paragraph 1.6, under ‘Inquiry process’, the report says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

           I am sure, but it is not read in Rockhampton! There were some concerns voiced at the public hearing in Rockhampton earlier this year that perhaps people were not given the best possible opportunity to take part in the inquiry process and that the consultation was not done as well as could have been. I am not sure whether that is a typo in the report, but if indeed the inquiry was advertised in the
           <i>

              training area, Rockhampton, Queensland. The proposed facilities upgrade will provide (1) an exercise control building to accommodate the significant increase in personnel and systems that are required to control large joint and combined exercises; (2) an Urban Operations Training Facility to allow combat team training for defensive and offensive operations, screens, search and rescue operations, aid to civil power and evacuation operations; and (3) a live-fire capable urban assault range, which complements the Urban Operations Training Facility. The estimated outturn cost of this proposal is $11.16 million.

The objective of the proposal is to provide facilities and infrastructure that are critical to the initial introduction and continuing operation of the multirole helicopter 90 in Townsville. The proposed facilities and infrastructure works involve a mixture of new facilities and the adaptation and refurbishment of existing facilities. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $20 million.

               This is a great day for Townsville. I was just indicating to the member for Dawson that she has an interest in this. With the new redistribution in Queensland, Dawson now comes well into areas in Townsville that are populated with defence families. You cannot underestimate the importance of this decision. I thank the

               This is a $20 million project ultimately to refurbish and to build new facilities to take the latest high-tech heavy troop lift helicopter in Townsville. Its key significance is that the

               90 supports Townsville’s 3rd Brigade, the home of the ready deployment force for Australia. It is also a key enhancement because we have recently announced that Townsville is going to be the home of a third battalion. In fact it will be the 3rd Battalion,
