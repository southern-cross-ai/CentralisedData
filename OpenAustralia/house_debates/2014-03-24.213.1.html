        I would like to congratulate the Kingsway City Shopping Centre for its most excellent 18th birthday celebrations on Saturday. It certainly drew a big crowd.

I was most fortunate that my desk was right across from there, so we were in a great position to interact with the crowd. There were several thousand people who turned out for the day. It was very gratifying to know that no-one came up and had a go at us for anything. In fact, I felt a lot of support there on the day, which augurs well for the 5 April election. I would like to thank the owner of the centre, Raymond Tan, and centre manager, Michael Tilaka, for such great organisational abilities to bring the whole thing together.

        Also there on the day were a couple of minions from the

        movie, and great local talent Veronica Bravo, who lives in Landsdale. I saw her father there; he is very proud of her great success and the opportunities she is getting in Hollywood as a singer. It is great to have a local talent in the Cowan electorate. There were many people who were involved in making the great day a successâ€”the face painters, the singers; it was just simply an excellent event, so congratulations to the Kingsway City Shopping Centre.
