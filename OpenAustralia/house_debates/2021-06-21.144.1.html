        I often say how proud and honoured I am to be the representative for the Chisholm electorate. The reason why I am so proud of Chisholm is largely down to those living in Chisholm. I have met some of the most incredible hardworking and committed individuals across my time as the federal member. Members of my community never stop ceasing to amaze me with their achievements and work they do in the area. I'm thrilled to see a number of these individuals are represented in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        this year. I've had the privilege of calling a number of those who received awards to congratulate them and talk about the outstanding work they do in Chisholm and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take the time to highlight those who have contributed enormously to those around them. Firstly, there is Professor Kylie Ball, who has provided significant service to physical activity and nutrition education. She is an academic powerhouse and an impressive woman. Congratulations to Professor Ball. Then there is Jan Rice, a strong and capable woman who I had the pleasure of speaking with last week. She has been instrumental in the provision of services to nursing, wound care and education. Well done on your award, Jan.

        is another resident of Chisholm who I had the privilege of speaking with last week to congratulate her on her achievements. She has played a pivotal part for youth in the World Association of

        . Thank you, Susan.

       <p>
        Finally, I give a shout-out to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Mitchell
        </a>
        , our very own ex-football legend in the electorate and another well-deserving addition to the Order of Australia. Even off the field, he has continued to make a notable contribution to the game. For that I commend him.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could continue to talk about the impressive achievements of all recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , but we simply don't have enough time. So I would like to give a quick shout-out to Mr Hong Nguyen, Ms Kay Speed and Ms Deborah Appel, all worthy recipients. Congratulations to all of you on the recognition you have received for your contributions and achievements.
