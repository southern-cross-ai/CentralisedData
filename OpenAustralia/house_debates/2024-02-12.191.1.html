              The meritorious awards recognise outstanding and distinguished service by public servants, members of the police force, fire, ambulance, corrections, intelligence or emergency services or in support of outstanding work with an Australian Antarctic expedition. On the South Coast, after so many years of seemingly never-ending natural disastersâ€”not to mention the pandemicâ€”these first responders are the true heroes of the South Coast community. It's a privilege to congratulate and thank Donna Brotherton
