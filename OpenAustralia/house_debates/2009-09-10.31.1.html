          <p>
           My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">
            Social Inclusion
           </a>
           . I refer the minister to reports in the press today that the grant of $250,000 to the one-student school at Evesham, under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
            Primary Schools
           </a>
           for the 21st Century program, will follow that child to another school should Evesham State School be closed. Isn’t it the case, as the minister told the House yesterday, that grants were made to every school not on application but as a universal, formula based policy, in which case, when our fortunate one student goes to another school, will that school receive a second grant? Will the money be returned to the taxpayer as a saving, or will it simply be pocketed by the Queensland government?

                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can interject all she likes upon me. This is a matter that I have suggested could be settled, if there is a problem for members of the House, by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                  Procedure Committee
                 </a>

                  North Sydney
                 </a>
                 , who thinks that he can interject upon me: I think that the person from whom I learned the most about this matter was in fact the former Prime Minister, who reminded us, each time, when a question was worded in a way that allowed it to be opened up, that, if a program was mentioned, that was sufficient. Whether the House as a whole is satisfied by that is a different matter. But—and I go back many, many parliaments—a number of governments have not taken the opportunity that was given to them by Procedure Committee reports to change this. So, consistent with past rulings, no matter how much criticism it brings to me, the mention of other matters under the program suffices the terms of relevance as they have been known in this chamber.

                  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and can I say that I think the sensitivity displayed just then by the opposition shows an important point to the parliament, which is: the member has approached the dispatch box to ask about one school. But of course what he does not want to be reminded of is that he voted against resources going to every school in this country: he voted against resources going to the 72 schools in his electorate, he voted against resources going to schools in my electorate, he voted against resources going to schools in National Party electorates, he voted against resources going to schools in the electorates of independents—every school in this country. He came into this parliament and he put up his hand and he said, ‘When it comes to spending money on schools, I say no.’ And, in line with that kind of philosophy, apparently the member for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
                   Wide Bay
                  </a>
                  is now saying the summit of his political career will be to come into this place and to say, ‘$250,000 that could be spent on a school should not be spent on a school.’ That is the summit of his political career, apparently.

                  The government will work with the Queensland education authorities as this consultation process goes through. We will work with any suggestions about alternative uses of that money. If an alternative use is identified, I will then come into the parliament and I will ask the member for Wide Bay—if we have identified a school that needs that money—to walk up to the dispatch box and say, ‘I do not support that school getting that money.’
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course, this shows the sleight of hand across the board by the opposition about

                  . We have the shadow Treasurer, known for his sloppiness and his inability to think logically, out there saying, ‘Cut the program; take money out of schools.’ The member for Sturt, who is only known for part-time work, at least had the wit—

                       say to the shadow minister: I was just about compliment him, so I did not want to be interrupted, because it is a rare day. The shadow Treasurer is out there saying, ‘Let’s cut funding to schools, to

                       .’ The shadow minister, the member for Sturt, at least has the wit to guard his language and not use that terminology. When he has been asked, he has said that funding should be maintained to schools. The opposition had better sort out its position on this—two different forms of words, and they voted against it.
