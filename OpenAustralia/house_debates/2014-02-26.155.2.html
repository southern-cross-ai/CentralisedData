       <p>
        Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful member of the Geelong community, Alison Murphy, who very tragically and very suddenly died yesterday. Ally was the embodiment of joy and optimism and fun. She was blessed with a fierce intellect, a strong sense of compassion and an infectious 'can-do' attitude. For Ally, anything was possible, and in every aspect of her life she made things happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met with Ally back in 2009, when I was running for preselection. As the owner of her own strategic communications company, RedStick, and as a member of the executive of the Committee for Geelong, Ally played a vital role in so many of Geelong's success stories. She was a trusted adviser and a first-class strategic thinker. As adviser to

        </a>
        , a former senator for Victoria, Ally made her mark. She was an incredible asset to Judith, particularly in her work in agriculture. I have spoken to Judith this morning, and she, like so many of Ally's close friends and colleagues, is devastated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judith described Ally as devoted, smart and a shining light—and that she was. While Ally worked here at parliament on one side of politics, she built her business by building loyalty with those on both sides of politics. This was an impressive feat and demonstrated the scope of Ally's skill and capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        She became a trusted adviser to the likes of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong Football Club
        </a>
        , GMHBA and the City of Greater Geelong. She built a great team—James, Karen, Jess, Jo and Julia—all of whom are numb with this dreadful news. She touched so many lives, and today so many people in Geelong and here in parliament House can barely come to terms with what has happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        In various ways, I have worked closely with Ally for the past five years. I was proud to call her my friend. She was a great friend to Senator Michael Ronaldson and to my electorate officer Melissa Bann. They too are devastated. This morning the member for Corio spoke about his family's wonderful friendship with Ally and her family. Being Ally's friend was easy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last time I saw her was 12 days ago, when we met as part of a steering committee working hard to bring the Land 400 defence project to Geelong. As the clock approached 3pm, we both looked at each other with that knowing smile as we prepared to do the mad dash to school pick-up. On Monday, Ally suffered a massive stroke. Today my thoughts are with Ally's husband, Peter—or Stevo as he is known—her stepson, Tom, and her precious twins, Charlie and Lucy, who have just started school. To them I say: your beautiful wife and mother was a shining light in so many lives. She will forever remain a shining light in your lives. Ally Murphy, we will miss you.
       </p>
