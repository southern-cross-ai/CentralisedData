       Dear Mr Murphy
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 1 March 2011 to Senator the Hon. Kim Can, Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, about the petition requesting CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses, factory farms and dairy farms, submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. Your letter was forwarded to me as I am the minister responsible for the matter you raised. I regret the delay in responding.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian standard for the hygienic production and transportation of meat and meat products for human consumption, abattoir operators must have systems in place to ensure that animals do not endure unnecessary injury, pain and suffering, and that they have the least disturbance practicable. Systems are in place in all states and territories to ensure that animal welfare in abattoirs is not compromised.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Where animals are on-farm or being transported, the Australian Government has no legislative responsibility. State and territory governments are responsible for their own animal production and welfare legislation. The government has played a leadership role by engaging the states and territories to develop model codes of practice for the welfare of animals. These model codes aim to ensure that farm animals are treated humanely and responsibly. The codes are reviewed from time to time to keep them up to date by taking into consideration technological and scientific developments.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The codes are being replaced progressively by a new series of nationally agreed standards and guidelines, which will be legislated by the states and territories. All states and territories are now working to implement the first of these, the Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelinesâ€”Land Transport of Livestock. The government ensures the inclusion of farming industries and animal welfare organisations, including the RSPCA, in these processes.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for bringing this petition to the government's attention. I trust this information is of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig
