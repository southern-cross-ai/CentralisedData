        I rise today to honour the memory and contributions of Bill Heck, who sadly passed away earlier this month, aged 90. Bill and generations of the Heck family have been stalwarts of the Beenleigh, Woongoolba and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobs_Well" rel="nofollow">
         Jacobs Well
        </a>
        area and the sugarcane industry for over 140 years. The family established and runs the Rocky Point Sugar Mill, which remains in operation today. Bill and the company provided significant economic benefits to the local area, through the mill, employing many residents and helping the sugarcane farmers develop their businesses. It was that service to the community, in addition to that hard work, that showed his true heart for our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through his work preserving our local history in Beenleigh, as the president of the Beenleigh Historical Village and Museum, and helping establish the Woongoolba pool, at which, for over 50 years, children learnt to swim, Bill was always giving back. Bill was instrumental in donating the old Heck homestead, Friedensheim, to the historical village for use as a function and information centre. I have had the immense privilege of knowing Bill and his family for many years. While Bill has passed, his legacy will live on. My condolences to his wife, Pat, and his family. Thank you for everything, Bill. May you rest in peace.
       </p>
