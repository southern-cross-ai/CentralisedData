       <p>
        I have a great number of terrific sporting clubs across my electorate of Forde. One of the benefits of sport is that it brings communities together and unites people of all backgrounds. In my community, sport is a great source of pride and honour. Today I wish to recognise the achievements of Eagleby Giants Junior Rugby League Football Club. I have the pleasure of regularly attending their games, and it was wonderful to see Eagleby Giants given a platform to share their unique story just last week, when Channel 10 news did their sports report live from the grounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a club which had humble beginnings in 2012. It was founded with the aim to develop a strong culture within sport that will assist players to become not only good footballers but also good people, which is why I believe the club's motto is very fitting and a good reminder to young people: 'Dream big and live large.' Sadly this year on the field, whilst the junior program is going gangbusters, the senior program have had one of those years they'd probably rather forget. But I'm pleased that the club has strong support and stewardship from two local legendsâ€”Mr Arthur Joyce, the club president, and Chappy Nick Carroll, the team captain. I wish them all the best. As Chappy Nick would say, onwards and upwards from here on out.
