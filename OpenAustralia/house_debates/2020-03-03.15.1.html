         International Women's Day

        . The day has been marked by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        since 1975, and its origins can be traced back to 1909. The theme this year is: '#EachforEqual. An equal world is an enabled world.' On Friday I'll be joining an International Women's Day breakfast held by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Community and Business Women’s Network with Business and Professional Women Central Coast and the Central Coast Festival of Women.

       <p>
        The Central Coast Community and Business Women’s Network was founded in 2018 by Sharyn Burgess. Membership opened just 14 months ago and it's climbed to 264. Sharyn was recognised for her outstanding efforts connecting business and community in this year's Central Coast Australia Day awards. CBWN believes connecting women leads to growth and resilience for the person, their business and our community. New members have described CBWN as a wonderful network of like-minded women and a fabulous opportunity to connect with like-minded-women in the local community. Congratulations to the Iris Foundation, Sharyn Burgess and all the local women who are joining forces through the Central Coast Community and Business Women’s Network to bring life to this year's International Women's Day theme: EachforEqual.
