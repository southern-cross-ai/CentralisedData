        I rise to raise concern about Telstra's plan to construct a mobile base station tower in Torquay at the Quay Reserve. This must be moved to a more appropriate location. This tower, in such a special green reserve, such an important recreation area, would be an absolute eyesore. Last week I met with residents who formed the group Save our Quay, and this week, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , I met with senior management from Telstra and urged them to relocate the tower. I'm also calling on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Coast_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Coast Shire
        </a>
        , including my Labor opponent, who is a counsellor, to refuse Telstra's planning permit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, once again, we see Libby Coker terribly conflicted in her dual roles as counsellor and candidate. This demonstrates, again, that she's not prepared to put the people of Corangamite first. If she was truly committed to the people coming Corangamite, she would have stood down from council. She would have done the right thing, as Brian McKiterick, the Liberal Party's first-class candidate for the seat of Bellarine, has done. Brian is making fantastic inroads in his campaign against a very poor Labor member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Neville" rel="nofollow">
         Lisa Neville
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There's no doubt that Libby Coker has been a very poor representative. She initially backed a council plan to destroy the Anglesea Bike Park to build the Messmate Track bypass. She wants to destroy the town boundary in Anglesea. Development is out of control in many parts of the shire, particularly in Torquay. Of course, as everyone knows, she has turned her back on thousands of families who are desperate for a pool in Torquayâ€”a pool which is vital for swimming safety, particularly for young children, as well as for wellbeing, health and tourism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the people of Corangamite will not forget how she has now abandoned them over the city deal. She stood with the member for Corio and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        several weeks ago, announcing $150 million for some very good projects in both the electorate of Corio and Wannon but, would you believe, not a cent of direct investment for Corangamite. This candidate has shown no capacity to stand up to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Corio and to fight for Corangamite over such an important deal. Frankly, that is not good enough. I'm very proud to be working hard to ensure that Corangamite gets its fair share of investment from the city deal and I will obviously continue to work very hard on that project until we announce it.
