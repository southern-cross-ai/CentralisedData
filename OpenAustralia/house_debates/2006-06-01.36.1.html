         I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his previous life of service in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         . At the moment across the world, in nine different theatres, the Australian government has approximately 3,600 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed. In deploying those men and women soldiers, sailors and air men and women, the government is very mindful and cognisant of the importance of the safety of our Defence Force personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
         We were reminded of that yesterday when an Australian light armoured vehicle, otherwise known as an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASLAV" rel="nofollow">
          ASLAV
         </a>
         , suffered an explosion from what we believe to be an improvised explosive device, otherwise known as an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
          IED
         </a>
         . Across Iraq there are about 2,000 such incidents a month and about 80 a month currently in Afghanistan. It is likely that in Afghanistan, in particular, the use of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEDs" rel="nofollow">
          IEDs
         </a>
         will increase. There was in yesterday’s incident relatively minor damage sustained to the ASLAV—to tyres and to a fan blade—and fortunately there was no injury at all sustained by the soldiers involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 21 May in Afghanistan, a long-range patrol vehicle was hit similarly with an IED. Significant damage was sustained by the vehicle and only very minor injuries were sustained by the soldier. Since September last year, five Australian soldiers have been injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. Four of those soldiers have returned to service with relatively minor injuries; the fifth, whilst sustaining a much more serious injury, I am advised will also return to service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recognising the potential risks of IEDs and the importance of working with our allies, the Australian Defence Force, in early March this year, established the counter-IED task force. It is looking specifically at improving our purchase of equipment and technology, which give us a better understanding of IEDs and how to deal with them effectively. We also have sent two senior ADF officers to work on IEDs with the United States joint command and its task force. Also, the Explosive Hazards Centre has been established by the ADF to further improve the training of our soldiers and Defence Force personnel, before they are deployed, in the risks of IEDs and how to deal with them effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         To date, Australia’s Defence Force personnel, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq, have suffered relatively few injuries compared to our coalition partners. We hope and pray that remains the case—and it is the case because of outstanding training; equipment, which indeed is the envy even of some of our allies; outstanding leadership by our officers; and also an Australian culture, which has a way of particularly wanting to understand the people with whom we work. But, as we see in the recent deployment into
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         , it is also important to remember that there are significant risks associated with it. Australians should appreciate that the risk in Afghanistan, as we go through the summer there, and also in Iraq, as we move into the next phase of transferring security across to the Iraqi security forces entirely, will further increase the risk to our Defence Force personnel. I also take this opportunity to thank and congratulate again the Australian Defence Force personnel in East Timor and to ask all those Australians who so rightly support an independent and democratic East Timor to also ensure that the support of Iraqis living in a democratic and free society be considered no less important by Australia.
