        I rise today to pay tribute and bid farewell to a friend and colleague,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Dunn" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Dunn
        </a>
        , who sadly passed away on 30 August. Chris was one of the most loyal, hardworking local members of the Labor Party, and his absence in the local community will be greatly missed. His Labor values stemmed from his own upbringing, coming from a working-class family, having completed a joinery trade apprenticeship to become a successful carpenter. He also spent more than 20 years working for the Sydney Water Board. Chris's contribution to the local community was diverse and invaluable. He was the public face and also life member of Parents Without Partners New South Wales. He held that position up until his death. Chris was also a bus driver for the South West Community Transport, where he assisted elderly residents to their appointments as well as shopping and social excursions. As a volunteer, he also drove buses for James Busby High School and several Liverpool community groups.

        His carpentry skills were also well used for the good of others. As a member of the Liverpool wood-turners guild, Chris helped others develop carpentry skills and made wooden toys for local children, hospitals and communities in need. Christmas was always a busy time for Chris Dunn. On many occasions, I have seen Chris's work on display at a number of trade and craft exhibits and local festivals. He was a very popular, gregarious and larger-than-life character. He was always there to help. His contribution to the local community led Chris to stand for Labor as a candidate at the Liverpool city council elections in 1999 and again in 2008.
       </p>

        I acknowledge Chris's contribution to the Hinchinbrook Branch of the Labor Party, where he served with distinction as president. Community contribution and voluntary work is certainly important, but there is no doubt Chris would have said his greatest achievement was being awarded

        in 1986. In the end, it is love and our connection to those closest to us that matter the most. Chris Dunn was a great bloke. He will be sorely missed by everybody who knew him. My condolences are with his family, especially his wife, Sue, and his mother, Margaret. May he rest in peace. Well done, old chum.
