       <p>
        On 16 May 2010, I was pleased to officially open the Scenic Rim Community Hydrotherapy and Health Management Complex. It is a fantastic initiative and I congratulate the whole Boonah community. I was present with Labor candidate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ramsay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and his wife, Trish, and it was a pleasure to be there. This project is an initiative of the Boonah Shire Disability Support Group, a volunteer community agency performing a wonderful service to the Boonah district. The pool will include top-class facilities, providing a number of people with wonderful support. I look forward to the day when the

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        go to Boonah to stay for the weekend and enjoy the wonderful facilities. The complex will offer age and disability assistance. It is centrally located in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and will be very beneficial for people requiring physiotherapy post surgery and for people with sports injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd Labor government has committed$480,000 to the project through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. The total cost of this program is over $1 billion. The facility will have year-round use, including learn-to-swim classes for youngsters, and will attract health professionals to the Boonah shire. Forty jobs were created as a result of the initiative. We are determined to provide for local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I announced at the venue, the claims by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        that the Boonah Hospital is to close are simply nonsense and rubbish. Labor is committing enormous funding to regional communities in terms of health.
