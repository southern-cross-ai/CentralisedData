       <p>
        Work continues on the recovery phase of ex-Tropical Cyclone Marcia in my electorate of Capricornia. This was the biggest storm in a generation to strike the

        . Rockhampton, Yeppoon and Marlborough districts have been declared state disaster areas. I want to stress that I have not been idle while here in Canberra. In the past 72 hours, I have been pounding the corridors of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        , meeting with senior ministers and lobbying for help for residents, small businesses and industries in our region. There are many issues to face.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capricornia's primary producers have been dealt an overwhelming blow. Our pineapple industry and horticulture and tropical fruit sectors have sustained terrible losses. It is not only fruit crops that have been destroyed; established fruit tree stock has been wiped out. One farm alone is expecting losses of between $600,000 and $1 million. These are family farms that employ local people and are an important part of our economy. I am anticipating an announcement outlining an assistance package for primary producers in the near future. I have also been lobbying for workers who cannot earn their normal income because their place of employment is shut down. Finally, I want to thank and acknowledge all the people, both professional services and volunteers, who were working tirelessly to help those affected.
