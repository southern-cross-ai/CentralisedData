       <p>
        Last week in the House I raised concerns that some constituents have with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Network" rel="nofollow">
         Job Network
        </a>
        providers. Today I would like to raise concerns of a constituent who has had enormous problems with Centrelink. This constituent had a very serious car accident. He was awarded compensation. Governments of all colours have always enforced a preclusion period, and I acknowledge that. But what I would like to point out to the House is the lack of compassion, the lack of sympathy and the inability of Centrelink to move on issues like this.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I mentioned, this guy had a serious car accident and suffered severe physical injuries, but subsequently he has had two brain haemorrhages and he has the preclusion period. As a consequence of the head injuries, he has suffered severe depression. He has blackouts. He collapses. With the money he received in compensation he bought himself a house and thought he had set himself up properly for the future. Now, with the exacerbation of his physical condition, he has no money and he has only paid off part of his mortgage. He has an elderly father who is assisting him. That is the only way he is keeping going. He is unable to even access a health care card.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have been working to try to waive the preclusion period. Unfortunately we have been experiencing a lot of difficulties. This is because of the inflexibility of the system and the failure of the system to take into account the extenuating circumstances. He cannot get his medication under the current system, and he suffers really severe disabilities—he has slurred speech and memory difficulties. I have to say that I was absolutely disgusted when I heard what Centrelink’s advice was to him. They told him to sell his house. This man is extremely vulnerable. There was one thing I mentioned earlier that was not quite correct. He is not my constituent. He is a constituent of the member for Dobell. He went to see the member for Dobell and got no satisfaction. But I am not going to turn him away. I am going to help him.
