       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to identify and praise those involved in two different sets of environmental activities within the electorate of Flinders. The first is in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Corps" rel="nofollow">
         Green Corps
        </a>
        project at Sages Cottage, Baxter. This is a project to refurbish and beautify the lands around Sages Cottage, Baxter. Sages Cottage has been taken over by Menzies Inc. Menzies Inc. is a community service organisation that has helped children within the Melbourne vicinity who come from disadvantaged homes. Many of them have been abused and have suffered deprived upbringings. This project will allow them to rehabilitate and discover something of themselves and nature in a wonderful and beautiful environment. I congratulate Menzies Inc., which takes care of disadvantaged children. I congratulate the Brotherhood of St Laurence and also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greening_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Greening Australia
        </a>
        , which is running these Green Corps projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second environmental initiative which I wish to deal with is in relation to community water grants. I am delighted that we have had a series of successful applications within the electorate of Flinders for community water grants, put forward by schools and community groups. All up, about $745,000 will be allocated under the Community Water Grants program to community groups, schools and other organisations within the electorate. In particular—and this is what is exciting—it is expected that this funding will help to save over 42 million litres of water which would otherwise be wasted every year. That saving of 42 million litres is being replicated around the country in 1,750 projects. As well as that, about 18 hectares of land which is currently degraded will be rehabilitated.
       </p>
       <p>
        What does this mean in local terms? It means that projects such as Balnarring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        ’s utilisation of stormwater for ablution facilities will help to save up to four million litres per year in this one school alone. Balnarring Primary School is one of the leading environmental schools on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        . It has its own wetlands. The children are involved in the propagation of species and the development of the wetlands. This is another example of a great local activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other schools, such as Hastings Primary School, using rainwater tanks, will save over a million litres of water a year. The Lord Somers Camp and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_House" rel="nofollow">
         Power House
        </a>
        will save 250,000 litres of water year in Somers. Tooradin Primary School will save almost 100,000 litres a year. These are tremendous local activities.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Island
        </a>
        Nature Park, on Phillip Island, will save almost 5½ million litres a year. The Powlett Project, which involves schools in

        and Dalyston, means that all of these areas are saving water. I commend the projects. I commend the schools.
