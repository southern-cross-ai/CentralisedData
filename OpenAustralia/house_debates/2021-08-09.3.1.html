         Committee
        </a>
        for the 46th Parliament, together with 73 petitions and 96ministerial responses to petitions previously presented—you might need a forklift for them!
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last sitting week I tabled the committee's report on its inquiry into petitioning security and accessibility. During this inquiry, the committee conducted a thorough examination of the security features of the House e-petitions system and considered what impact they had had on the public accessibility of petitioning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also considered whether additional security features, such as the use of official records to verify identity should be implemented, if an age requirement should be imposed on petitioning and whether the current practice of users self-declaring their Australian citizenship or residency was enough to uphold the legitimacy of the petitioning process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the inquiry, the committee were particularly mindful of how any change to the system would impact on a person's democratic right to petition the House, and to ensure that the process for petitioning electronically was, as far as possible, no more onerous than signing or creating a paper petition by hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's final report on the inquiry provides a thorough presentation and analysis of the evidence received, including from some international and domestic jurisdictions that support petitioning. In the report, the committee concluded that any proposed changes to the current system security or processes, beyond routine upgrades, would disadvantage certain cohorts of the community and diminish their right to accessible petitioning. The committee therefore made no recommendations for change, but instead will continue to monitor the current process and conduct reviews as necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.
