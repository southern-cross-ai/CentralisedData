        area continue to provide surprising hope for the endangered species's survival. Science for Wildlife researcher Dr Kellie Leigh says that less than a decade ago the general view was that there weren't many koalas in the Blue Mountains and, if they were around, they were at low density and not of great significance. But her project, running since 2014, has found koalas breaking all the rules, living above 800 metres, on sandstone country where soils are poor and the size of the gum trees is limited. Plus, the koalas are free of chlamydia, which has ravaged other populations, and they've been found to have the highest genetic diversity in the nation. That makes them pretty special, even with the big losses during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        fires.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, ecologist Dr Lachlan Pettit is investigating the suitability of the Blue Mountains area for avoiding the worst of temperature rise due to climate change, given the effect that heat has on koalas. Dr Pettit says the habitats of the World Heritage area, which can't be cleared for development, are critical because there are deep gullies and old-growth forests which provide a lot of shade and cooling. Estimates are that the koala population has fallen by 62 per cent in the last 20 years, so our Blue Mountains is going to be a vital habitat for their survival. That makes it even more important to ensure the integrity of the Blue Mountains World Heritage area, not just for koalas but also for all the other biodiversity.
