        The ice epidemic on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        is having a huge impact on our community. Methamphetamine and ice usage on the Central Coast has increased by 112 per cent over the last two years. What is most frightening is that we know that ice usage has increased dramatically since these figures were released. This drug is hurting families and placing enormous pressure on community and health services. Government and community need to work together to stop this terrible affliction on our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        To assist the National Ice Taskforce, I have facilitated the Central Coast Ice Summit, to be held on 22 May. Our community is at crisis point with this drug. It is disheartening that during my consultation with constituents I heard time after time the effects caused by this despicable drug. Its usage is wreaking havoc on our community. Families are being torn apart, health professionals are facing threats to their personal safety and lives are being lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        The support for this event from law enforcement agencies, health professionals, community organisations as well as print and radio media outlets and venue sponsors demonstrates how important this issue is for our region. I would like to thank Mingara, the
        <i>
         Central Coast Express Advocate
        </i>
        and radio stations Sea
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        and 2GO for their support. By working together on a local level, we can develop a coordinated, strategic approach to tackling the devastating consequences of ice usage.
