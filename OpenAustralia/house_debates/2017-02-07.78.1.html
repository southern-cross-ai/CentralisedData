        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry, representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister outline how industrial relations reform supports the creation of jobs for hardworking Australians? Is the minister aware of any unions who do not support the restoration of the rule of law to building and construction sites around this country?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I know that he, like the rest of the government, is very interested in the effect that the Australian Building and Construction Commission can bring to the wider economy in Australia, creating jobs, investment and growth. I am very pleased to say that the last time the Australian Building and Construction Commission was in place it saved consumers $7½ billion in costs, it increased productivity in the building and construction industry by 16½ per cent and it led to a very real reduction in days lost due to industrial strife. Last year, as the House would know, the Turnbull government passed legislation to bring back the Australian Building and Construction Commission—a signature achievement—after many attempts over the previous three years.
        </p>
        <p>
         One would assume that every member of the House, whether they were Labor, crossbench or government, would want to create the kinds of jobs that can be created through higher productivity in building and construction by having less union militant behaviour and by reducing the price to consumers. But it is not so. The Leader of the Opposition led the Labor Party into opposing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Many of us in the national policy area scratched our heads and wondered why. I think we have now picked up a few reasons why. There may well be a coup because of the revelations of the year of funding up to the 2016 federal election. The union movement spent an incredible $26½ million of other people's money campaigning against the Turnbull government.

           There was $9.7 million donated directly to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
            ALP
           </a>
           , including $1 million from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           donated directly to the ALP. There was $16½ million spent on political campaigns, including $300,000 from the CFMEU. So the CFMEU spent $1.3 million in the lead-up to the 2016 election in one year campaigning against the Turnbull government. So the union movement spent $26½ million of other people's money into campaigning against the Turnbull government.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Leader of the Opposition has certainly followed the adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune. The No. 1 priority of the

           was to stop the Australian Building and Construction Commission and that is precisely what Labor's policy was. Labor dismantled the

           . They opposed it root and branch. That is because this Leader of the Opposition is in hock to the union movement.
