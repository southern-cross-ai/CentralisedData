        Every year, bartenders across Australia help the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Leukaemia Foundation
        </a>
        by showing us their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGLY" rel="nofollow">
         UGLY
        </a>
        , which stands for 'understanding, generous, likeable you'. These people are all helping people who are dealing with the challenges of blood cancer. The Leukaemia Foundation's UGLY bartenders create fundraisers, games and experiences that people visiting the pubs and clubs can get involved in. The aim is to come up with unique and fun ways to raise funds.
       </p>

        There are many bartenders and venues that got involved across my electorate of Page, and I would like to congratulate them and their workplaces on getting involved: Blake Astley from the Rous Hotel in Ballina,

        Together they have raised over $30,000, and I congratulate all of them and their employers on their support for this worthy cause, because, Madam Deputy Speaker, as you would know, the Leukaemia Foundation offers many services to those suffering from blood cancers. They offer free apartments and other accommodation for people who need to have a home away from home when they are undergoing treatment. They also have patient transport services, where volunteer drivers help people get around. They have other support services like counselling, education sessions and literature on blood cancers, and much more. They also do research and clinical trials, and have put millions of dollars into that over the last number of years. I congratulate everyone involved in the Leukaemia Foundation—and I must declare an interest: my wife works for the Leukaemia Foundation. I know the great work they do, and I thank everyone for their fundraising efforts.
