        The people of Petrie are doing it tough under this Labor government. Fourteen months ago, when he was Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister made some promises that life would be cheaper under him, under the Labor Party. This was shared in a headline in the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        on 22 May 2022. He also promised at the national Labor campaign launch in 2022 that mortgage repayments would be cheaper under him, and on 97 occasions he promised to lower electricity bills by $275. Clearly, on every single one of those promises he has failed miserably, and so has the Labor government. They were clear

        s, key performance indicators, from the Prime Minister: life would be cheaper under him, mortgage repayments would be reduced, electricity costs would be lower by $275.

        , says: 'I am impacted the same as all mortgage holders: a thousand dollars or more per month on top of what I was paying previously, on top of the cost of living.' For Amaya, that's an additional $12,000 a year or more since the Prime Minister was elected. Life was cheaper under the Liberal and National coalition; that's clear. The Labor government have broken election promises, clearly.

        Henry Johanson, from Deception Bay, says: 'My rent has increased by $300 in twelve months. Labor government'—

       <p>
        that is, the Queensland Labor government—'changes to laws mean that landlords can only raise rent once a year but now increases are larger.'

       <p>
        The issue is that the Albanese Labor government's budget did nothing for working families, nothing for middle-income Australia—the vast majority of people in my electorate. There is an alternative, and that is a Liberal-National government. We will continue to fight hard and put forward alternative policies to those of this bad government that's currently leading Australia.
