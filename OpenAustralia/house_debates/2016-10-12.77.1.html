        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism. Will the minister update the House on how the

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Last year the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP

         alone, unfortunately, received more than 11,000 reports about online child exploitation. It is becoming increasingly important that we bridge the digital divide by educating parents, teachers and carers to be vigilant and to look out for dangers that may face their kids online. Predators can be very clever at exploiting young people online, so it is vitally important that we show the risks that our kids face, how they might be exposed to these risks and how we can go about minimising them. We also need to educate people about where to report problems.

         annual report. ThinkUKnow is a vital initiative that demonstrates the commitment of the government and the Australian Federal Police to educating our children on how to say safe, respectful and resilient online. ThinkUKnow is free. It is an evidence-based cyber safety program that provides educational presentations to parents, carers and teachers, and students, across Australia. Over the past year dedicated volunteers have delivered more than one presentation every day of the year to more than 10,000 parents, carers and teachers. These sessions are delivered by a network of trained volunteers and are about the benefits and the challenges associated with different technologies. Over the past year state and territory police delivered ThinkUKnow presentations to more than 150,000 school students from years 3 through to 12, with students being educated on topics such as cyber bullying, sexting, online grooming and other inappropriate content.
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of state and territory police forces are partners with us in this program. It is Australia's first and only nationally delivered crime prevention program that is delivered through the police in conjunction with the private sector. As a result of the success of ThinkUKnow and the increased risk of younger children being exploited online, the government has expanded the ThinkUKnow partnership to begin educating children from, unfortunately, ages as young as eight. Given the ongoing success of the program, the AFP is working to further expand and develop presentations and information for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians

         , for culturally diverse communities and for Australians with a disability. I thank the AFP, their state and territory police partners and their industry partners in the ThinkUKnow program for the tireless work they have been doing in this area. It is important that we ensure that parents, carers and teachers understand the risks that our children do face in the online environment and that we do make a difference in teaching them to keep themselves safe. We are committed to this ongoing protection of our children online and to providing parents and carers with the information that they need particularly if they see that something has gone wrong.
