        I rise today to congratulate Hockey
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        on their incredible achievement of being named the 2023 sporting organisation of the year at the Pride in Sport Awards. This award is a testament to their unwavering dedication and exceptional efforts in fostering
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTIQ
        </a>
        inclusion within Australian sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout 2022, Hockey ACT embarked on a journey to promote inclusivity and create a welcoming environment for all. Their initiatives are truly commendable. They hosted the pride round, a significant event that not only increased the visibility of the LGBTIQ community but also raised awareness and provided education and training to the wider ACT region. Additionally, the organisation appointed seven Hockey ACT pride ambassadors, reinforcing their commitment to LGBTIQ inclusion. By improving governance among LGBTIQ members and fostering a safe and welcoming atmosphere, Hockey ACT set a new benchmark for inclusivity in the sporting realm. The recognition Hockey ACT has received is even more exceptional when considering it has come with the highest pride index score in the history of the award. I also want to pay tribute to the ACT government's Office of LGBTIQ+ Affairs, which was instrumental in providing support, resources and knowledge to drive these positive changes within Hockey ACT. While this award is an important milestone, Hockey ACT also acknowledges that the journey towards full inclusion is an ongoing one. Thank you, Hockey ACT, for showing the rest of the country how it's done.
