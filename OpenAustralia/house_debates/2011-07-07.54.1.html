        On Sunday there will be a lot of discussion, and in fact Labor members are reported to have been prepared with a household-by-household analysis in their electorates of the impact of the Labor carbon tax—household by household data to help Labor survive walking into its own political disaster. Taxpayers' money has been used to analyse household impacts in order to support the survival of Labor MPs, but no data has been collected on the impact of this carbon tax on Australia's small businesses. In fact, small businesses are the unspoken word of the carbon tax debate. We hear it might be 1,000, it might be 600, it might be 700—who knows precisely, in this muddled mess that is the carbon tax?

        today that indicate that small business is fearful of this tax. Small business has not been factored into any of the government's decision-making and compensation packages. The question is, why does Labor so hate small business?
