        I spent an amazing Saturday night in the member for Bruce's electorate at the Dandenong Basketball Stadium to watch the under-20 men's final between Victoria and Tasmania. It was a gripping match and one that went down to the wire. It went into double-overtime, ending with a score of 105-104. In the middle of the game the power went out because of an electrical storm, and we had to sit there for a while waiting for the lights to come on. I was there in the capacity of a family member, watching my nephew Matthew McCarthy on the ground.

        It was an amazing event. I want to put on record a big shout out to the Victorians, who took a clean sweep of this national championship, winning all four of the events on record, taking out the men's under-20, against Tasmania, and the women's under-20, against WA. There was also the Ivor Burge metro men's and women's teams. These are teams for people with intellectual disabilities. Again, Victoria won both the men's and the women's. Amazing. The women's overcame

        in a great final game, and the men's defeated Japan, an overseas visiting team. A big shout out, and thank you to all those involved in this amazing tournament. To the players, coaches and referees and, most particularly the parents, a big thank you for the efforts you make on behalf of your kids participating in a sport they love. The kids are driven all around the state to get to these events. It was a terrific event and it was sad that it was not covered by anybody.
