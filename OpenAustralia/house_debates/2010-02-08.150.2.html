       <p>
        Tonight I want to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Murphy" rel="nofollow">
         Don Murphy
        </a>
        , a very special man from my electorate. Don died on 29 January 2010 at the age of 67 after a two-year battle with cancer, which I understand he fought courageously right to the end. Don was a restaurateur. He was the welcoming face at Woodchoppers Inn, at Mudgeeraba. Indeed, he was a great bloke, well known by everyone in the Mudgeeraba community. He was often referred to as ‘the mayor of Mudgeeraba’ or ‘the silver fox’—he had a great head of silver hair.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was certainly a very generous and warm human being, he was kind and considerate and he hosted some wonderful events at Woodchoppers Inn. In fact, his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         New Year
        </a>
        ’s Eve parties were legendary; I have attended a couple myself. Don was passionate about local business. He was an active member of the Mudgeeraba Chamber of Commerce and he promoted Mudgeeraba at every opportunity. He certainly was a true ambassador for Mudgeeraba. He also supported local events and charities. He was always there when we needed a helping hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Don’s family I want to extend my sincere sympathies tonight: his wife, Gina; his children, Alison, Luke and Victoria; Andre, Sean and Sarah, to whom he was father-in-law; and his grandchildren, Sam, Max, Charlie and Ellis. To all those people, all his relatives and friends, our sincere sympathies, and may Don rest in peace and be forever remembered as the smiling and welcoming face of Mudgeeraba.
