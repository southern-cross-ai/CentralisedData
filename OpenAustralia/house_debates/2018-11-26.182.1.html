        After Mackelly's clothing store and Sid Jones's butchery, Carney's shoes is Maclean's third-oldest family business, recently marking its 70th year. The store owners, Marcia Carney, Patricia Skinner and Stephanie Tunstead, have decided to call it a day and have put the business on the market. The family-run store has been at its 247 River Street address for all but six months of those 70 years, when Maria and Patricia's father, Bill, knocked the shop down to build the Carney Arcade. Long-time family friend Stephanie was appointed as manager before Marcia and Patricia bought out the other family members. Their focus and understanding of their community has seen the shop go from strength to strength. Located in sugarcane-growing country, the shop offers monthly accounts because the owners know that growers and farmers don't always get a weekly pay cheque. Quite often, family and friends of older members of the community who are living in retirement villages will take a selection of shoes for their elderly relatives, to see if they want to buy them. Marcia says simply, 'We support the community, and they support us.' My wife has commented often on the great selection of shoes they have. I'd like to congratulate Marcia, Patricia and Stephanie for being the heart and soul of Carney's Shoes. I wish them all the best.
