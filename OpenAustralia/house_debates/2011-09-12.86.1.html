        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. What action is the Australian government taking with the international community to ensure the reduction of carbon emissions from ships? Minister, what evidence is there that the world is acting to address climate change?

         I thank the member for Fowler for his question. Indeed the world is acting on climate change, contrary to what those opposite have to say. On 15 July maritime countries agreed to the first ever shipping emissions regulations. Fifty-five of the world's biggest seafaring countries agreed at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Maritime_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          International Maritime Organisation
         </a>
         to reduce climate emissions from shipping with a global agreement to reduce energy use in new vessels from 2013 onwards. Of course, Australia as a founding member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO" rel="nofollow">
          IMO
         </a>
         was a key player in this action.
        </p>
        <p>
         This agreement represents the first ever mandatory global greenhouse gas reduction regime for an international industry sector. It is an international industry sector that has come together, regardless of nationality, to put in place an international regulatory regime to take action on climate change. The agreement will force all ships over 400 tonnes built after 2013 to improve their efficiency by 10 per cent, rising to 20 per cent between 2020 and 2024 and 30 per cent for ships delivered after 2024. This agreement is expected to lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions in shipping of 45 to 50 million tonnes a year by the year 2020. We know that there are economic productivity gains from good action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as is the case with shipping. There will be savings of some $5 billion a year by 2020, once again reinforcing this government's view that good environmental policy is also good economic policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Shipping currently accounts for about three to four per cent of man-made
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
          CO2
         </a>
         emissions worldwide. This figure is expected to rise by six per cent by 2020, with emissions doubling by 2050 if no action is taken. It is consistent with this government's view, which is why we have also promoted a shipping policy that will support coastal shipping and support greater use of shipping as the most greenhouse-gas-efficient transport mode around our coast. This is another example of the government's good environmental policy. Taking action on climate change is consistent with international action and is good for jobs and good for our economy.
