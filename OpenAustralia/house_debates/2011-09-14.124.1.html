        On Sunday, 4 September 2011, I joined with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Mayor
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith City Council
        </a>
        , Councillor Jim Aitken
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , to officially open the new facilities and refurbishments undertaken at Howell Oval and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Stadium
        </a>
        in my electorate. At the 2007 election I committed the federal Labor government to providing $5 million towards the development of a Penrith Valley sports hub. I am delighted to be part of a federal Labor government that has delivered on this commitment and ensured that our local residents now have access to some of the most impressive sporting and recreational facilities in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the original proposal involved a double-sided grandstand, the project had to be reshaped after rising sewer mains were discovered under the proposed site. I thank the members of the Penrith Stadium redevelopment working party for their efforts in working together to overcome this significant obstacle and for ensuring the successful delivery of this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Howell Oval now features a new cricket pavilion, clubhouse and training facilities, including new change rooms, additional seating, indoor nets, scorer's box and function room. Penrith Stadium has also received a new entrance, new spectator facilities, new toilets and amenities, and new food and beverage facilities at the southern end.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge and thank those who contributed to the success of these projects. Firstly, I thank Penrith City Council for their management of the projects, in particular the general manager,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Stoneham" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Stoneham
        </a>
        , and Mr Andrew Robinson. I thank the Penrith Cricket Club, especially the president, Mr Greg Gavin, and the secretary, Mr Ross Graham, for their patience and flexibility during the construction process. I look forward to seeing the Penrith Cricket Club benefiting from these new facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge and thank chairman, Don Feltis, and the board of directors of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Panthers" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Panthers
        </a>
        for their commitment to ensuring the success of the Penrith Stadium redevelopments and their ongoing service to rugby league in our local community. I acknowledge local sporting icon Mr Trevor Wholohan, after whom the new function room at Howell Oval has been named. I commend Trevor Wholohan for his 60 years of outstanding service to cricket as a player, volunteer and administrator.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the opening it was a pleasure to meet a number of the descendants of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howell" rel="nofollow">
         William Howell
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Hunter" rel="nofollow">
         Norman Hunter
        </a>
        , after whom the oval and pavilion were named. These gentlemen have left a strong sporting legacy in our local community of which their families can be very proud. The recent opening of the Penrith Valley Sports Hub was complemented by a fantastic win by the Penrith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XI" rel="nofollow">
         XI
        </a>
        over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        SpeedBlitz Blues in a Twenty20 match, showcasing some of the exceptional sporting talent in our region. The fact that Penrith was able to attract such a high-profile fixture, with the New South Wales cricket selectors attending, is a testament to the quality of these new facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am extremely proud to see the vision of a Penrith Valley Sports Hub become a reality. I offer my sincere thanks to all of those who have contributed to the success of these projects and I look forward to seeing many generations of players and spectators in our local community benefiting from these fantastic new facilities.
