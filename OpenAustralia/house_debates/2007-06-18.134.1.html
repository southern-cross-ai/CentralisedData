        Early this year, in National Youth Week, I launched the first ever Scullin youth survey. The survey arose out of the work of the Scullin youth advisory committee, which I set up during an earlier National Youth Week. The members of the committee thought that a survey which indicated those things that young people thought important would be the best way of reflecting the needs of young people in the electorate of Scullin. Six hundred and sixty-one young people participated in the survey. Of interest, the results showed that 79 per cent of respondents indicated that they had some form of paid work, 52 per cent of those that had employment indicated that it was on a casual or part-time basis and 56 per cent of respondents indicated they were undertaking some form of educational activity. Another interesting aspect of the survey was the question of unions. Whilst only 23 per cent of respondents indicated that they were members of unions, which is about the national rate—

         That’s a bit high.

          It was very high if you look at the number of people who were actually in the workplace. But the very important question was that 64 per cent supported the role of trade unions in Australia’s workplaces. The other aspect that I found slightly surprising—but I think that, on more mature reflection, I can understand it—was that when asked who they would turn to if they were having personal problems, 95 per cent of the young people said they would turn to parents, relatives and friends. I think that that was a reflection of the fact they do not use community agencies or the internet and they do not use other services that are available. Importantly, I think this is an indication of where we should filter messages that we wish to get through to young people about where they should turn for assistance through those primary sources of information. Any campaign that actually targets youth, quite obviously should be empowering parents, relatives and friends to assist young people when they seek assistance.
         </p>
         <p>
          As you know, my electorate is a very diverse electorate and that was one of the things that young people indicated that they liked. Comments about what they liked or disliked about their area included: ‘It’s a good community’, ‘Poor public transport to city, it’s slow and overcrowded during peak time’, ‘I like all the different people and the services available’ and ‘Diversity of the nationalities and the general friendliness’ compared to ‘Isolated, too far from city and bad public transport.’ When asked what they would like to see changed or improved in their local area, they said: ‘More public transport, for instance bus stops’, ‘More events/locations for people to hang out with peers’, ‘There is a need for more job opportunities locally’ and ‘More activities for young people that promote harmony and friendship.’
         </p>
         <p>
          The other aspect was that they indicated that employment was very important. They also indicated the issues that were most important to them. When we looked at the four most important issues, they were health—by a street; education; employment; and family. Thirty-eight per cent indicated that the most important issue was health—physical and social. Comments were made such as: ‘Health and wellbeing is vital to happiness’ and ‘Health and wellbeing is important for quality of life.’ When talking about education: ‘Education is necessary for employment and career development’, ‘Education provides me with better job opportunities’ and ‘Education is knowledge.’ Employment was not just about the economic basis of employment. Comments were made such as: ‘Employment is important for personal finance and confidence.’ When talking about families, comments were made such as: ‘I believe family is the building block of a good society.’ Other comments were along the lines of: ‘Family, togetherness and support is part of wellbeing.’
         </p>
         <p>
          Of interest on the question about unions—and, in fairness, in the survey we published both the positives and the negatives—there were negative comments such as: ‘Unions are a form of politics. I’m not interested’, ‘Unions aren’t really relevant in my chosen career’ and ‘They never helped me in the past.’ But those comments have to be balanced against: ‘They are the representatives of workers’, ‘Unions make sure industry standards are maintained’, ‘They ensure everyone is treated fairly and equally’ and ‘Unions help balance work commitment and assist with problems that may arise.’ And, perhaps from somebody who has been paying attention to campaigns that are going on, one comment was: ‘They fight for my rights at work.’
