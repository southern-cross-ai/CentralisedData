       <p>
        I rise today to convey the news to my electors in Corangamite that I have announced with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keenan" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Keenan
        </a>
        , the Minister for Justice, very important emergency relief for those who suffered in the recent bushfires in Victoria. Minister Keenan has announced, along with the Victorian Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Jane Garrett, under the joint Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, a range of assistance for those affected by the bushfires. In my electorate there was one particular man—I will not go into the details because he has gone through a very, very tough time—whose name is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Carter" rel="nofollow">
         Brad Carter
        </a>
        . I spoke to him this morning. He lost his home in a fire in Wensleydale which burnt 10 hectares and completely wiped out his home and his tools. So it has been a very devastating time for him.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased to say that eligible individuals and their families suffering personal hardship and distress will now have access to the following emergency grants: Emergency Relief assistance of up to $520 for an adult and $260 per child to cover emergency food, shelter, clothing and personal items; and significantly Emergency Re-establishment assistance, which provides assistance of up to $31,950 per household for clean-up, emergency accommodation, repairs, rebuilding—that is for a principal place of residence—and replacing essential household contents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the state and Commonwealth governments have obviously acted very quickly to provide this very important relief in the areas affected by the bushfire: the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Macedon Ranges
        </a>
        , Mitchell, Murrindindi and Surf Coast, which I represent. More details are available on my website, sarahhenderson.com.au, as to how people can make an application.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have talked a lot about the importance of governing with care and with compassion, and I know that the people of Corangamite will see that we have acted quickly in relation to the particular family which has been very severely affected by this bushfire. It is a very scary time, in some ways, in the lead-up to summer. I have been very proud to advocate for the upgrade of a roundabout in Anglesea, which has caused huge issues with traffic build-up, coming into summer. For those who suffered on that terrible day of

        so many years ago, those memories are very alive as to what happened along the

         Great Ocean Road
        </a>
        in places like Anglesea, Moggs Creek and Lorne. I am very pleased to make this announcement with the minister and, as I say, it is just one more reflection of a caring and compassionate government.
