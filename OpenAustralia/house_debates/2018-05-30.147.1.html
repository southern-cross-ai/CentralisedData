        On 6 May, I attended the Bankstown Sports Little Athletics Centre presentation down at Bankstown Sports Club. It was a fantastic afternoon with a really high-quality presentation that did the club proud and showcased the talents and skills of the little athletes involved at the club. There was a very professional audio-visual presentation, which highlighted each of the kids who were being acknowledged on the day. As I said, it was a very, very high-quality professional presentation. I presented the Banks outstanding sporting achievement awards to some younger athletes involved at the centre. A great afternoon was had by all. I'd like to thank the club president,

        ; vice-president, Greg Facer; championships officer, Steve Sorojevic; publicity officer, Debra Topalidis; secretary, Leanne McDonald; and all of the other many volunteers involved at Bankstown Sports Little Athletics Centre for everything that they do for kids in our community.

        On 16 May, I attended the meeting of the Mortdale Probus club. We have a very strong Probus community in the Banks electorate, with many Probus clubs. Probus clubs provide a great environment for friendship, for activities and for putting back into the community. The first Probus club in Australia was established some 40 years ago. Probus really is one of the linchpins of the local community in the Banks electorate. Mortdale is particularly active and participates in a wide range of different activities, such as bushwalks, fishing, craft, various lunches and other outings. Thanks to the president, Janice Owen, and everyone who was there on the day for their hospitality. I look forward to visiting the club in the future.

        On 24 April, I caught up with Ted Palumberri, the president of Renown United Rugby League Club, down at Renown Park in Mortdale. Renown is one of the largest rugby league clubs in the St George area, with more than 10 junior teams. When I was at Renown Ted showed me the plans for the new clubhouse. The old clubhouse has given loyal service over many decades but really does need to be replaced, and it's great to see that will be occurring. Renown is a really important site, not just for rugby league but also for soccer and other sports in our community. One of the issues at Renown Park is that the lighting needs to be improved, and that's something I will continue to work on. Thanks to Renown Rugby League.
