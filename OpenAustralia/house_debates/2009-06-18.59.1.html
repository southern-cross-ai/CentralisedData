        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to comments made yesterday by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Sam Williams
        </a>
        , Chairman of the Naracoorte Primary School Council in my electorate, in which Mr Williams described how that school had been forced to use non-local contractors, at a cost of ‘about 2½ times dearer per square meter to have our buildings built’ than the non-government school in town. Can the minister explain how this represents value for money?

         I am very pleased to get a question, while representing the Deputy Prime Minister, about education and infrastructure. An important part of the government’s commitment to infrastructure is indeed the $14.7 billion
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Building the Education Revolution
         </a>
         fund. That is delivering infrastructure to every primary school in the country, including to the electorate of the member for Barker: Angaston Primary School, $950,000; Berri Primary School, $2 million; Bordertown, $2.5 million; Morgan, $2.5 million. All of these schools will benefit, including Naracoorte Primary School—and not just Naracoorte Primary School but Naracoorte South Primary School as well—because we on this side of the House are determined to deliver for every school in the country, no matter how unfortunate they might be in being represented by the member for Barker, who, of course, voted against this very project.

            There would be no need to shout if people listened first time up. The point of order is simply relevance. The minister is responding to the question. I would have thought that, if people were asking about value for money, the context of the program under which this was being funded and matters relating to that were of relevance.

                         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. It is not the role of the Speaker to have critiques on questions, but if you want me to I will. In this case the member for Barker asked a question about a specific primary school. A course of action has been suggested by the minister. The minister is now, I assume, going on to explain how that course of action, by giving examples of other schools, can be put in place. I think if the behaviour of the chamber were to improve we might get through question time, after an hour and 20 minutes, and the behaviour has added to the length of time that we are here.

If we just get back to basics, it strikes me as ironic that having asked a question earlier on there is an objection based on the fact that it was an earlier question. But that is not why I am ruling that this is relevant. It is relating to the program under which the school that was mentioned by the member for Barker is being funded.
