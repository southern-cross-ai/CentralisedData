        Over the weekend just passed, the prowess of the Mornington Peninsula's sporting women was on full and fabulous display. I had the pleasure to meet with the President of the Peninsula Surfriders Club, Sean McDevitt, at the East Coast Cash Competition at Shoreham Beach, and cheer on our local competing champions. The event featured club participants from all over the state, competing for a $1,000 prize, each for best male talent and best female talent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Flinders local Ava Holland came second in the open women's event. Ava started surfing on the Peninsular as an 11-year-old and quickly rose to stardom. She is currently ranked third in Australia in under-16 women surfers. I also met other talented female surfers like Rose Holland, Sophie Wilkinson and Ruby Armstrong, all aged between 11 and 15.
       </p>
       <p>
        Somerville Senior Netball A and C grade girls also won their grand finals over the weekend. Waves Junior Football Club, who I visited a few weeks ago, have two teams playing in the upcoming grand final in the under-11s and under-15s. Waves junior footy also had two previous female players graduate to the AFLW. Somerville junior footy club's under-13 girls were valiantly defeated in a preliminary final, but the fearless Pumas under-15 girls are playing in their grand final this weekend, and we wish them all the best of luck.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition's announcement of $250 million for community sporting infrastructure specifically to benefit girls' needs will significantly help the local sporting clubs in our electorate to help improve facilities and encourage more participants on their journey to sporting greatness.
