         Air Services Australia
        </a>
        proposes to undertake a continuous improvement program to replace or refurbish the Airservices Australia air traffic control tower inventory. Airservices Australia operates 26 air traffic control towers throughout Australia and, as the age of the towers increases, the ability to cost-effectively maintain the facilities and to maintain and upgrade equipment diminishes. The control towers range in age from 10 years to around 50 years with an average age in excess of 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The objective of stage 1 of the National Towers Program is to replace the existing control towers at Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Rockhampton airports. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $94.5 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that a design and construct contractor will be appointed by the end of 2007 with construction completed some 20 months later. This will, however, be subject to the responses received when the market is approached. I commend the motion to the House.

        proposes the redevelopment of the Defence Force School of Signals at Simpson Barracks, Watsonia, Victoria. The objective of the proposal is to address current facility shortfalls required to deliver communications and information systems training to Defence personnel. The proposed facilities and infrastructure works involve a mixture of new facilities and adaptation and refurbishment of existing facilities. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $101.3 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence in early 2008 with completion by late 2009. I commend the motion to the House.
