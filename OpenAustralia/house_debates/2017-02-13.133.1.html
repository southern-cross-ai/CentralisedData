       <p>
        On a sad note, I rise today to speak about someone who was such a great contributor to the electorate of Hindmarsh and the western suburbs and to senior citizens clubs in my electorate. I am speaking about the passing of Tricia Clement, who, sadly, passed away on 23 November. Tricia had been involved in the Active Elders senior citizens organisation in my electorate for many years, and that is where I first met her. She was also a member of the executive of the Council of the Aged in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and assisted, volunteered and helped in aged care, social clubs and a whole range of things, helping them with getting grants for their groups et cetera. Tricia used the experience that she gained as a volunteer at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COTA" rel="nofollow">
         COTA
        </a>
        to help many groups get many grants, especially for the Active Elders senior citizens in my electorate. Together with her partner in crime, Jan, the treasurer of Active Elders, she would call me regularly for letters of support to assist them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tricia not only helped Active Elders get grants but also helped many other senior citizens groups. Together they put together the paperwork for Marion council that got them a grant for a new kitchen. Tricia was also heavily involved in the applications and presentations that resulted in the Active Elders senior citizens winning the Every Generation award twiceâ€”not once but twice. That is a very big award in South Australia. She was involved in setting up the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justices_of_the_Peace" rel="nofollow">
         Justices of the Peace
        </a>
        and community dinner that is now in its eighth year, and she was fundamental in helping set up the over-50s forums held by the Marion council every quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tricia was a passionate person. She was passionate about involving older South Australians in the community. She helped set up the intergenerational programs at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Ascot Park
        </a>
        and Marion primary schools. This involved the senior citizens groups having interaction with some of the primary schools and getting to see what kids are doing and kids getting to see what senior citizens are doing. This was a wonderful idea and a wonderful concept which involved groups of women from Active Elders, for example, spending one afternoon every week in a classroom sharing art and craft activities with the kids. This was a wonderful way of linking the classroom to the neighbourhood and connecting the students and their learning with the local community. This led to a number of joint activities that greatly benefited both the children and the members of Active Elders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main thing that Tricia Clement offered was her enthusiasm, her friendship and her humour. She will be sadly missed. At pretty well every Active Elders function that I went to, she would be there to greet me and to lobby me about getting a particular grant for something or about someone that she knew was in need and thought that I could assist. She will be deeply missed by all, but I am certain that her influence and her indelible mark on Active Elders and the wider community will be remembered for a very long time to come. Thank you, Tricia, and rest in peace.
