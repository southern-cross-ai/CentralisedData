        I would like to bring to the attention of the House a visit I made to the Taree Motorcycle Club at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bar" rel="nofollow">
         Old Bar
        </a>
        on 29 August for the Australian dirt bike championships, which were enjoyed by 4,000 to 5,000 people from the region, interstate and internationally. The Taree Motorcycle Club was the recipient of a $70,000 Commonwealth government grant, which it used to upgrade the toilet facilities and the point-scoring board in its newly renovated grandstand. During my visit I was given a great tour of the facility by none other than

        The races were incredibly exciting. I was disappointed to hear that Troy Bayliss in the finals on the following day had quite a bad crash. He is recovering back at home on the

        . All of the people in the electorate really value this club. It has been there since 1961 when it moved from the old airport nearby. They had the first Australian dirt bike championships there in 1966. They also have the Troy Bayliss Classic, which brings similar numbers to the area over the Christmas-
