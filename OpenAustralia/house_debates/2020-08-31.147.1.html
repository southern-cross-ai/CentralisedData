       <p>
        I rise to speak in support of the Morrison government's JobKeeper program. It's an initiative that has benefited thousands of hardworking people in my electorate of Robertson.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since its introduction JobKeeper has supported more than 990,000 businesses and over 3.5 million employees Australia wide. In doing so it has injected more than $42 billion into Australian households and businesses to help fast track our nation's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. I'm really proud to be part of a government which, through JobKeeper and other economic initiatives, is helping to keep our national economy afloat. A big part of this is ensuring that our small and family businesses remain open, including the more than 47 per cent of enterprises across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        local government area that are currently using the JobKeeper payment to keep their employees in jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've heard from many of these businesses about what this program means to themâ€”businesses like South End Social, which is a really great newish cafe in Gosford. It has 12 staff on JobKeeper, and it's one of many, many new cafes which have been opening around the Central Coast over the last couple of years. The co-owner of the cafe, Michael Griffiths, said: 'Without the JobKeeper payment my cafe would still be closed and I'd have to have let go of my hardworking staff. It's the sole reason I can keep my cafe open and running today. The day this payment was announced I, and many other people in the hospitality sector, breathed a huge sigh of relief, knowing that there was light at the end of the tunnel.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Rod Dever, from the Gosford/Erina and Coastal Chamber of Commerce, said that the JobKeeper payment has been a lifeline to many small businesses. He said that not only has it ensured employees have an income during this difficult time but it has also kept people engaged in their employment and has maintained their valuable skills and training.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Jackson" rel="nofollow">

        , from Ettalong Diggers, actually rang me to express his appreciation for the JobKeeper initiative. He said that it had been a massive help for his local club, particularly during lockdown when they were unable to open. Bill said that it's really given his club the confidence to plan into the future and to see a way out of the coronavirus pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just some of the many examples of businesses in my electorate of Robertson who are benefiting from the JobKeeper program. But the government recognises that Australia's recovery is still in its early stages and that several businesses and individuals remain significantly affected by the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. That's why, despite plans for JobKeeper to run for an initial six-month period, the government announced that the program would be extended for a further six months until 28 March 2021. Our recent amendments have also ensured that the program continues to be available to those who need it and that Commonwealth, state and territory government agencies have access to the information that they need to best tailor policies in response to the continued impact of coronavirus.
       </p>
       <p>
        The extent of the program has been particularly important to those businesses that simply cannot shut down. This includes businesses like the very important
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Reptile_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Reptile Park
        </a>
        in Somersby, where the park director, Tim Faulkner, explained that closing was simply not an option, given the many animals that rely on them for care, day in and day out. Tim said he really felt protected by JobKeeper and that it was a real game changer for him and his staff. An employee at the park, Liz, said it was wonderful to know that she'd be able to continue to care for the wildlife which brings so much joy to those who visit the park and which is also important to conservation efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another crucial service that's been supported by JobKeeper is CrocStars Swim School, which provides swimming lessons for children with disability. The owner, Natalie, said to me that she had to close the swim school for 14 weeks, but because of the financial backing that JobKeeper provided she was able to maintain contact with her staff. She has recently reopened and she is again able to offer classes that provide students with important life skills and social interaction.
       </p>
       <p>
        These examples highlight the tenacity and dedication of so many Central Coast business owners this year. I really want to thank each and every one of them and all of those who have not been mentioned tonight as well for adapting to recent challenges and for the crucial role that our local businesses play in creating jobs for our local community. I know the government will continue doing all it can to support small and family businesses, so important to my electorate on the Central Coast. Our policies are not set-and-forget, and we will continue to monitor the evolving impacts of COVID-19.
