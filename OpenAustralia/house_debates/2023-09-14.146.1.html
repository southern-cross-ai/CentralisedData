       <p>
        There have been a number of exciting events involving my wonderful constituents in Chisholm over the last few weeks. It is my great pleasure to inform the House of some of these activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I had the enormous pleasure of meeting with the Minister for Education,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Clare" rel="nofollow">
         Jason Clare
        </a>
        , and a brilliant young woman from my electorate, Jaya Bladthorn, in the parliament. Jaya is currently studying nursing at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University
        </a>
        in Chisholm, and she visited parliament along with a delegation from the university that included acting provost and senior vice-president Sharon Pickering and Aunty Carolyn Briggs. This meeting was quite remarkable. Jaya beautifully shared her personal story of growing up in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Hill
        </a>
        , coming from disadvantage and ultimately being able to access a scholarship, allowing her to move to Melbourne to pursue her studies. Monash University's enriched scholarship program, Kummargi Yulendj, empowers Indigenous and economically disadvantaged students, including those from regional and remote areas, to reach their full potential through a holistic experience that extends well beyond the classroom and includes the financial support required to not just get to university but stay in university.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to commend Monash University for this significant investment in our communities and the next generation of leaders. It has been such a wonderful time in my electorate. I recently had a very fun time seeing the Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Victoria's performance of the Pirates of Penzance. This is a group that's based in my electorate, and the production was at the lovely
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Theatre" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at Monash University. It's wonderful to be able to support such exciting arts groups in the community. I want to extend my congratulations to all involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations are also due to the Surrey Park Football Club under 19.5s team, who won the 2023 premiership. What an amazing achievement! It's been more than a week since the victory, but, by all reports, the teams are still celebrating. I want to add my voice to the many voices in my electorate congratulating the team. This sort of success hard-game success isn't limited only to the players on the ground. We all know that about our sporting clubs in our communities. It takes terrific administration, staff, volunteers, supporters, family and friends to get teams in a winning position and, of course, to help clubs thrive. To the whole Panther community: congratulations! Next time we're in parliament, I look forward to again updating the House on my wonderful community in Chisholm.
