        I stand today to honour a great leader, Percy Iszlaub, of Wondai. He passed peacefully this week, just two days after his 92nd birthday. He'll be put to rest at 1 pm on Friday, 9 February at Wondai. Only last week I travelled to Wondai to visit Percy. We shared a lot of great memories from over the past 10 years that we've known each other. Percy was known as the face of Wondai, and for very good reasons. He represented all those marvellous trades of the bush. His face would beam with joy every time he would welcome a visitor to his town. For almost 40 years Percy dedicated his time and energy to working for the Wondai community and the shire council. He served as deputy chairman, chairman and, later, mayor. He was critical in achieving so much for the community during his time.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">
         South Burnett
        </a>
        Australia Day awards, Percy was presented with a special award acknowledging his lifetime of service for the South Burnett. Percy was also a keen rugby league player, cricketer and target shooter. In addition to his family, he loved his tuba and playing for the Wondai and District Band. Percy is survived by his wife, Alison; his two daughters, Jane and Leigh; and four grandchildren. Rest in peace, Percy.
