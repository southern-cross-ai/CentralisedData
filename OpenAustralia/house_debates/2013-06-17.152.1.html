       <p>
        I rise tonight to ask the Treasurer and ask the minister for agriculture what is going on with the Farm Finance package. Farmers across Australia need some certainty. They need to know what is going on: whether they are going to see this package by 30 June so that it can be rolled out come 1 July, or whether the incompetence, whether the blame game, is going to continue. Currently all we are seeing are glossy brochures on the department's website advertising the fact that this Farm Finance package is ready to go, yet what we have is the Commonwealth not knowing where it is at, the states not knowing where it is at and farmers completely in the dark.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was 5½ years ago, or probably a little longer, when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        said to Australians that if he was elected, then the Labor government would stop the blame game. Now, 5½ years later, what we have is the blame game continuing to farcical levels. Let us have a look at the letter that Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, sent to the state governments on how this package will be finalised. In it he says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would be extremely disappointed if farmers in need of immediate assistance were disadvantaged by a state refusing to contribute only the administration costs of the concessional loan element.
       </p>
       <p>
        He then goes on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am of course open to consider options you may have identified to reduce overall administration costs and seek your views on how this might be achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        So first we have the Labor government saying, 'States, we want you to pay all the administration costs'. Then they are writing back to the states saying, 'Well, we might not want you to pay them all; we're happy to negotiate with you.' What has led to this change? We found out that what the Commonwealth was happy to do was borrow money at three per cent, but then loan it the farmers who are suffering at 4½ per cent—keeping the 1½ per cent interest rate for their own administrative expenses and yet saying to the states: 'Well, don't come begging to us. You've got to find a way to implement your own administration costs.'
       </p>
       <p>
        So what have we got the states coming out and saying? That the Commonwealth should not profit from farm loans. This is a fair thing to say. What I cannot understand is why the Commonwealth cannot say to the states: 'Let's sit down, let's negotiate. We're obviously looking to make sure that we don't get hit with the costs of implementing this. We're happy to work with you on this. Further, we're happy to address the concerns that you have raised.' For instance, the states have said they are still waiting for final documentation that will establish the funding mechanism, the loan criteria and the reporting requirements. Once this is received, they will be happy to roll out the Commonwealth funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also found out that there have been letters that have gone to the Commonwealth from Rural Finance asking them about the details of the package, yet still Senator Ludwig or the Treasurer has not responded. I do not put the blame with Senator Ludwig because, when this package was announced, all the reporting seems to indicate that it was done by the Treasurer and by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Katter" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Katter
        </a>
        and that Senator Ludwig was in the dark. Treasurer, your incompetence knows no bounds. It has been on display for over 5½ years. Do one last thing that might help redeem yourself just a tiny bit. Be honest with the states. Sit down, negotiate with them and get this package finalised. Your legacy is not glossy documents on a website but the detail of the package not finalised or negotiated properly with the states. The incompetence has to stop. We need proper governing. Treasurer, you have one small chance to redeem your appalling record. Get this farm finance package sorted.
