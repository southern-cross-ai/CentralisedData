         I thank the member for his question. The government are proud that 12 months ago, when we were sworn in as a government, we had already declared that we would be the first country to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. Now, 12 months on, this chamber has passed the measures. We expect that the measures will be before the Senate next week. I hope very much that the Senate will support the measures in the same fashion that they were supported in the House. It would be particularly timely given that next week, as part of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>

         </a>
         , the first non-communicable diseases conference is being held. It will be only the second time in the history of the United Nations that they have had a dedicated health forum combined with the General Assembly. Last time, as members would know, it was to deal with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
          HIV
         </a>
         . Now it is to deal with the growing burdens caused by cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and a range of other illnesses, which are caused in large part by a number of risk factors and tobacco is the leading one amongst them.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are very proud to be part of a government that is delivering on our commitment to be the first country to introduce plain packaging. Of course this reform has not been easy. It will not necessarily have an easy passage in the Senate. It is being met by very ferocious opposition from big tobacco companies that have spent in the order of $10 million on negative advertising campaigns. We are absolutely determined to do what is right here. We know that, if we can reduce the harm from tobacco related disease, not only will we significantly reduce the number of Australians who die each and every year from tobacco related illnesses—15,000—but, more importantly, we will also ensure that the number of families who suffer as a result of those deaths is reduced in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         I hope the opposition will encourage their Senate colleagues to support this measure in the Senate next week. I think it will be a proud moment for Australia, which has a history of both sides of politics having taken ambitious steps in leading the world on tobacco control, to have this measure passed at the very time the rest of the world is debating measures that can also be taken on tobacco control. If Australia is the first to introduce this measure, we know we will not be the last. That will be good for countries around the world and many thousands of people. It is estimated nearly six million people around the world die every year from tobacco related illnesses. We can take a step to make a difference. We can help the rest of the world take a step to make a difference too.
