         on indulgence—Just in recognition of the unusual times that we're in and the fact that, to hold this sitting here today across this chamber, 47 of our colleagues—on this side and on the opposition benches—aren't here, as they've been paired. I'd like to just acknowledge their names for the record: the member for Bennelong, the member for

          on indulgence—I, too, would like to name all the members who are not here today from the opposition. Their nonattendance has allowed us to be here to pass necessary legislation to help in relation to the coronavirus. The opposition agreed to pair 47 government members, and, because of that, many of my colleagues were not able to be here today. As a matter of fact, as a consequence, only 21 Labor members are here in the chamber. We owe a debt of gratitude to those who showed their cooperation in allowing us to have our sitting today with the necessary social distancing that applies.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to thank Ms Aly, the member for Cowan;
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Burns" rel="nofollow">
           Mr Burns
          </a>

         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to acknowledge: we did have a reserve list of members to be in the building but not necessarily in the parliament, just in case we needed to have others to attend. So I acknowledge Ms Bird, the member for Cunningham; Dr Freelander, the member for Macarthur; Mr Husic, the member for Chifley; Mr Gosling, the member for Solomon; Ms McBride, the member for Dobell; and

            on indulgence, if I may—it's not in exactly the same category, but the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, who I spoke to beforehand, has expressed that he is also staying away to facilitate a parliament that can meet with restricted numbers. I understand that the members for Mayo and Clark may have also separately corresponded and had their correspondence tabled; they are in the same position.

             I thank the Chief Government Whip, the Chief Opposition Whip and the Leader of the Greens for placing the names of all of those members on the record. It is very important that those members are recognised. I know electorate offices are very, very busy, as we know here, but I thank them for the sacrifice of agreeing not to come. Looking around the chamber, it's self-evident why they couldn't all come.
