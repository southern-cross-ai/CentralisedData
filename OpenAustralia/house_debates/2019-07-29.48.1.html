       <p>
        There are 50 outstanding schools in my electorate of Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is always a privilege to visit them, as well as to host students from year 6 when they come to Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today to encourage all 50 schools across my electorate to consider applying for funding under this government's new Local Schools Community Fund. It's a fantastic program, which will see up to $200,000 delivered to each electorate to help local schools with small but vital projects. Every school can apply for funding with a project between $1,000 and $20,000. Projects could include things like small extensions; landscaping; installation of shade structures, air-conditioning, playgrounds; sports equipment; the installation of new

        equipment or software; musical instruments perhaps; or facilities for students with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Applications are now open and schools and P &amp; Cs can apply through the SchoolsHub portal with applications closing on 30 September. I encourage all schools to get involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the applications are submitted we'll convene a local advisory committee. This process is very similar to the very successful Stronger Communities Program. I'm looking forward to seeing some great outcomes from this particular program too.
       </p>
       <p>
        School leaders are best placed to know which projects will benefit their school community and students. The fund will allow them to pursue those projects that will make a huge difference. There are guidelines and eligibility requirements, and schools can expect to receive some further information over the coming days. I can't wait to see some of these important local projects come to life.
