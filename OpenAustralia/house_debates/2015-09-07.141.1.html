       <p>
        Last week Australia celebrated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flag_Day" rel="nofollow">
         National Flag Day
        </a>
        . Now, few Australians may fly the Australian flag in their backyard, but many of us wear it, whether it be on caps, capes, thongs or T-shirts. And why not! We love Australia and we love to celebrate the fact that we live in what is, indisputably, the greatest nation on earth. Whatever background they come from, Australians share a joy of their good luck from being born in this great nation. But what does our flag say about Australia? What does it say to us? What does it say to our region? My view is that the Australian flag represents the country that we once were, not the nation that we have now become.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian flag was first flown in September 1901 at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_Building" rel="nofollow">
         Exhibition Building
        </a>
        in Melbourne, the then seat of the federal government. The flag was one of two winning designs from an international competition.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Barton" rel="nofollow">
         Edmund Barton
        </a>
        is claimed to have said it encapsulated 'the Australian identity and pride'. Australian identity was much different then than it is today. Consider that in June of that year, Edmund Barton introduced the bill for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Restriction_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Immigration Restriction Act
        </a>
        into that same parliament—a bill that formed the basis of what was better known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have come along way since then. Australia is a nation transformed. Approximately 15 per cent of all Australians were born in Asia, with many more claiming Asian heritage. In total over one in four Australians is born overseas. Hindu is our fastest growing religion. China is our largest trading partner, our second is Japan, our fourth is Korea and our fifth is Singapore. First- and second-generation

        remains on Australia's flag say to them? Does this represent them? Does this reflect them on the international stage? Few Australians would say that we are not a far greater nation today than we were in the time of Edmund Barton. But, if we can acknowledge that we have changed since those times and acknowledge that the Australian identity has changed since the Federation parliament, can we also not acknowledge that we need to update our national symbols—that we, like Canada and as

        is currently doing, need to engage in a discussion about whether we as a nation can come together and adopt a flag that better represents the nation that we have become and better reflects the diverse, multicultural, open society that we now are? I hope that in future on National Flag Day we will be able to celebrate such a flag.
