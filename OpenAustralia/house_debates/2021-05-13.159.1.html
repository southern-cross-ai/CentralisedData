       <p>
        On Tuesday evening, the Treasurer detailed our government's plan to create jobs and guarantee the essential services that will build the stronger and more resilient Australia of tomorrow. This budget delivers a critical lifeline to the Australian economy, which is dealing with the economic consequences of a one-in-100-year pandemic. In doing it, our budget reduces personal income tax for low- and middle-income earners. In Barker, 66,000 low- and middle-income earners will benefit from these measures. People earning between $48,000 and $90,000 will benefit, with up to $1,080 for individuals and $2,160 for couples. That's more money for the hardworking burghers of Barker to keepâ€”money they earned. We're also continuing to incentivise business to invest, by expanding for a further 12 months the instant asset write-off scheme. That means tradies can buy a new ute; a farmer can buy a tractor or harvester; and many of the food manufacturers in Barker can have additional capex. That's in addition, of course, to the expanded loss cap measures, which will support around 4,600 businesses in Barker. To assist businesses in getting the skills we require, we extended the 50 per cent apprentice wage subsidy scheme. That has already supported a whopping 2,455 apprentices in Barker, but there is more work to be done.
       </p>

        To make Barker an even greater place to live, work and raise a family, our government is building generation-defining projects, part of the $110 billion infrastructure pipeline over 10 years. The Truro bypass, at $161.1 million, is something I've advocated for almost all the time I've been in this place. There's an additional billion dollars for the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, including $17 million for councils in Barker. There's a further round of the Building Better Regions Fund, at $250 million, and, of course, the very popular Stronger Communities Program, providing modest but meaningful grants to community organisations. But, more than all of this, this budget secures our essential services. There is more funding for hospitals, schools, aged care, Medicare, mental health and disability support, which are always better guaranteed under a coalition government. There are too many wins for Barker in this budget for me to go through here today, but I'm pleased to say that the Australian government is supporting the Australian economy and people in Barker to roar back into action.
