       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill makes a number of important improvements to the tax law.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, it improves the fairness and integrity of the fringe benefits tax system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, it restores the intent of the tax treatment of employee share scheme arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        And third, it aligns the period over which taxpayers can write-off depreciable in-house software with that for computer hardware.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures are part of a budget that has delivered significant reform of tax expenditures to improve productivity, fairness and integrity in the tax system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has moved with the times on this.
       </p>
       <p>
        A major theme of the 2020 Summit was the need for a tax system that is fair, simple and efficient.
       </p>
       <p>
        I quote the following from the initial summit report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia needs a tax system that supports the global competitiveness of our economy, provides incentives, minimises distortions and supports fiscal responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reforming tax concessions is an important step in this direction.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill restores the original intent of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBT" rel="nofollow">
         FBT
        </a>
        law by tightening the arrangements for eligible work related items, and property consumed on an employer’s premises.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBT law currently exempts certain work related items.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the exception of mobile phones, computer software and protective clothing, there is no requirement that these items be used for work purposes in order to be FBT exempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBT exemption was introduced in 1995. At the time it was thought that generally any private use would be incidental.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, changes in technology have meant that certain items are commonly acquired for personal use.
       </p>
       <p>
        Laptops are one example.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBT exemption allows employees to enter into tax-effective arrangements to acquire these items out of their pre-tax income.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments restore the original policy intent to restrict the FBT exemption to items used primarily for employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The exemption will also be limited to one item of each type per employee each FBT year, unless it is a replacement item.
       </p>
       <p>
        The list of eligible work related items will also be updated for technological changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will remove uncertainty for taxpayers, industry and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        as to whether electronic devices with more than one function are FBT exempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also remove depreciation for FBT exempt items purchased after 7.30 pm
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Eastern_Standard_Time" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Eastern Standard Time
        </a>
        13 May 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        This addresses a double tax benefit under the existing law whereby an employee can claim depreciation for an item that is also FBT free.
       </p>
       <p>
        For items purchased before that time, depreciation will be removed for the 2008-09 and later income years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is also tightening the FBT exemption for the private use of business property.
       </p>
       <p>
        With a meal card, an employer pays for employee meals provided by a third party located on, or delivering to, the employer’s premises.
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee can salary sacrifice a meal card to purchase lunch, coffee and other consumption items out of their pre-tax income.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments will exclude meals from the FBT exemption where they are provided as part of a salary sacrifice arrangement.
       </p>
       <p>
        This restores the intended policy and improves equity in the treatment of employee remuneration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Genuine staff canteens will not be affected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure may also promote greater competition between meal providers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is because it removes a disincentive for employees to shop around for the best price or quality available for meals.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also amends the income tax law to close a loophole in the employee share scheme provisions and addresses double taxation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amending the election requirements in the employee share scheme provisions will stop taxpayers manipulating when they have a tax liability for discounts on employee shares or rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will ensure discounts are properly included in assessable income.
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee will be required to make an election by including the value of the discount in their income tax return.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amount must be included in the income year they acquire the shares or rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second change will remove double taxation where certain employee share schemes use an employee share trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments will ensure that the trustee or beneficiary of the trust can access CGT relief.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 2 amends the tax law to extend the write-off period for in-house software from 2½ to four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the same as the tax commissioner’s safe harbour period for computer hardware.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amount deductible is unchanged, but the write-off period is extended by 18 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the software is scrapped before four years, the business will still get an immediate write-off for the remainder under the existing tax law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Small businesses are generally not likely to be impacted by the measure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses that pay an annual licence fee for their software generally won’t be affected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments in this bill help restore fairness to the tax system and contribute to funding the government’s key priorities for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.
