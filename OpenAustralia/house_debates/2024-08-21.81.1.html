        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, why is Australia handing out tourist visas to Gazans from a terrorist controlled war zone in an average of 24 hours and, in some cases, as quickly as one hour, while bypassing all the usual checks, including those that the former coalition government used in Syria? Will the Prime Minister admit that the government's visas for votes scheme was only done to shore up votes in the seats of Watson, McMahon and Blaxland?

          Mr Speaker, as you previously ruled, under standing order 100 there is a rule on imputations that doesn't apply elsewhere in debate. You ruled previously that, when it was used in a question, that exact phrase is not appropriate. It's now being used deliberately in defiance of that ruling.

            Mr Speaker, the first point to make is that this was a question about the government's policy settings. There was no reference to any individual. This was a question about the government's policy settings. The standing order that the Leader of the House refers to is one that the government flouts on numerous occasions. For example, the question asked of the Minister for Health and Aged Care after decades of cuts and neglect. Let's have a consistent approach, Mr Speaker, to the questions asked by both sides.

             I'm going to deal with this in an orderly and respectful way. We don't need commentary from the sidelines. I'm going to ask the member to state the question again because I didn't hear the full question. I want to make sure it's within standing orders and that, within the question, there are no reflections on any ministers or individuals.

                More people came from Syria under visitor visas when they were in government, when

                 ISIS
                </a>
                was in charge of a large amount of Syria, than the 1,300 people who have come from the occupied Palestinian territories.

                note this as well: there have been 5,491 visitor visas granted from Israel as well. And let me say this: those people are welcome here.

               <p>
                What is going on here is so obvious, and the member for Groom is certainly very conscious of it. You know it's a shocker when no-one on the frontbench will ask you. It goes up the back, in order to sledge a whole group of people who live in

                 Western Sydney
                </a>
                . I say this to those opposite: you can continue to sledge people in Western Sydney. What I'll continue to do as Prime Minister is represent the entire nation, including the good people of Western Sydney. They know that we take the same advice from the same security agencies, as the previous government did. We've rejected more than 7,000 visa applications. They also know—the member for Groom mightn't know, because he just asked the question he was given, so I don't blame him—that the

                </a>
                is controlled by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities and it has been closed since May. But the member for Groom didn't come here from anywhere in the
