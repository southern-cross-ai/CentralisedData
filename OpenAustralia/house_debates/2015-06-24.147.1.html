        I rise today to update the House about an important infrastructure project in my electorate of Swan, which I have been working very hard with both my federal and my state colleagues to secure funding for. The project will be of significant benefit for every single resident of my electorate of Swan. This is about the relocation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        and the redevelopment of Lathlain oval.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project is a plan to redevelop a facility which, if it comes to fruition, is going to not only provide state-of-the-art training facilities for the team and administration but will also provide vital sporting, recreational and social facilities for the community of Swan and the surrounding areas. It is an ambitious plan which will cost $67.93 million to fully implement, but this West Coast Eagles Lathlain Precinct Redevelopment Project is exactly what the Lathlain community—or, more broadly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Town of Victoria Park
        </a>
        —needs to boost its local economy and provide much needed community facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been campaigning for this project since 2010 when I first had a quiet word in West Coast Eagles
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Trevor Nisbett's ear about this particular project, as I knew that their club was looking to relocate. Lathlain oval is also the home of the Perth 'Demons' Football Club. I am sure that the Prime Minister would attest that I have had a lot more than just a quiet word in his ear about this particular project, which has had an application for $10 million in federal government funding, and that is what it needs in order to progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just to highlight the benefit that this project really will have for the community—aside from the two football ovals, the synthetic running track and the indoor and outdoor training facilities that will be developed, which, I highlight, will also be accessible to the public and junior football leagues—it will also include education areas with dedicated areas for community development programs; a community hub, including a cafe and club museum; a new home for the Wirrpanda Foundation, which will deliver community outreach programs locally; and barbecue areas, playgrounds and walk trails.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, another key aspect of this project, which I believe is important to highlight, is the club's landmark agreement last year with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        Resources Trust for the provision of rehabilitation facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathlain_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Lathlain Park
        </a>
        . This will play a vital role in the development of medical research in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , with the two parties intending to collaborate with Western Australia's five universities on a research project. This project will be the first time that the five universities have come together.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also had support from
