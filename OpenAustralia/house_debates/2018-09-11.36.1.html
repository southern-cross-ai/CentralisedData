       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Leslie Roy Davies, known to his family as Les. Les was born in Gympie, Queensland, on 13 December 1923 as the sixth of nine children to a not-so-well-off family. Losing his mum at a very young age, Les left home at 15 to start a new life. He found work as a porter for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Rail" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Rail
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        then ensued. Les joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        , enlisting to become a pilot. He did well in his training, but a big night before his test meant he failed to pass. Les didn't let this deter him. He trained as an

         AG
        </a>
        , an air gunner, joining

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Command" rel="nofollow">

        . Les was one of three from his crew to survive the war. The death rate of Bomber Command was 41 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1943 to the end of the war, Les and his crew flew 34 operations over Germany. Upon returning from the war as an officer, Les moved to Sydney to study. What became of his life post-war is a true testament to his character. The boy who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, Les worked as a publicist for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and then as a director for the Metal Trades Industry Association, where he was an integral part of negotiating the 38-hour week. Les also met a life partner in Patricia at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA" rel="nofollow">
         MTA
        </a>
        , and worked there until his retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 12 August, Les passed away at the age of 94. He was a father of five, stepfather of one, grandfather of five and stepgrandfather of four. May he rest in peace.
