       <p>
        On Monday, 17 October Radius Disability Services entered into administration. It caught everyone off-guard and caused a lot of distress within the community. Radius had been serving people with a disability and their families in our communities for 62 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Going into administration caused a lot of distress for many people: 130 supported employees found themselves without employment, 102 day clients found themselves without a place to go, and 78 general employees were all caught up in the situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the patience of the families and employees involved and how they have worked with the department to see placements going forward. It is good to stand here today and say that this week we have learnt that all 130 supported employees have been offered a place and that the day clients have also been found suitable services to take over their placements. We hope the general staff will transition with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the work of the assistant minister in this place, who has worked with my office and the agencies involved, but I call on the government to support the organisation taking on these clients and supported employees and, if extra funding is needed, to provide it.
