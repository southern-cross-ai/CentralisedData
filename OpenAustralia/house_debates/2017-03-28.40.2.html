        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister update the House on the actions currently being undertaken by the

         Australian Defence Force

        in preparation for the disruption and damage as a result of Tropical Cyclone Debbie? How will the ADF assist Queenslanders during and after this natural disaster?

         I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. As the Prime Minister has already said, Cyclone Debbie is quite probably making landfall as we sit here in this chamber in question time debating the issues of the day. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         , who are yet again going through another destructive cyclone—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         wreaking her revenge on us poor humans here on Earth. The member for Capricornia has been through this before, of course, with Cyclone Yasi, and now again with Cyclone Debbie.

         The ADF is ready and willing to do its part to support the residents of North Queensland—the businesses, the communities, the individuals and the families—that will be affected by this natural disaster which is shaping up on our shores. To update the House, a joint task force, primarily made up of personnel and engineering equipment from the Townsville-based 3rd Brigade, is prepared to provide support within the region, including aeromedical evacuation, search and rescue, road clearance, restoration of essential services, emergency accommodation and the delivery of stores.

         It is sad to hear the member for Batman trying to make political mileage out of a tragedy that could well engulf people in North Queensland. His cynicism is really disgraceful, and stands in very stark contrast to the comments of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of Queensland
         </a>
         , Anastasia Palaszczuk, who said today about the role of the Commonwealth and the ADF:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I have never seen this level of preparation. I also want to thank the Prime Minister. I spoke to him first thing yesterday morning, I spoke to him again late last night. The level of cooperation is unprecedented and I said to him, I thank you very much for making the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

         personnel available to help Queenslanders in their hour of need.
        </p>
        <p>
         We agree with the Premier of Queensland. The ADF will put its best foot forward to ensure that the people of North Queensland are supported by the Australian government. I, and on behalf of the government, thank those people for the sacrifices that they will make on behalf of Australia and on behalf of the government.
