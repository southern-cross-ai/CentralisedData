        Today in the House we were joined by some very motivated young, professional Queenslanders who are proud members of the Queensland Young
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP

        . All have undertaken a road trip out of Queensland to come to Canberra to catch up with their idols and to become a little more politically aware of the current debate. However, these young Queenslanders have a political position and opinion that they want to share with their colleagues back home. These outstanding young Queenslanders have a strong opposition to the carbon tax. There is a growing number of young people standing against the carbon tax. The Young Liberal-National Party are a part of this anti-carbon tax movement in Queensland. They understand the economic impost that this toxic tax poses to their livelihoods and to their fellow Australians. The opposition to this reckless tax has been on display in a series of demonstrations by young people, including Liberal-National Party members, throughout Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        These Young Liberal-Nationals are a group of like-minded people aged between 16 and 30 years. They are motivated to make a difference by protecting individual freedoms for all Australians. They do this by being an integral part of campaign teams across the state, even so far as by helping their interstate counterparts. They also develop policy in conjunction with senior party members of all levels of government. This was demonstrated recently at the Liberal-National Party convention in August when all the policies put forward by the Young Liberal-Nationals were adopted by the party as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the devastating Queensland floods, the Young Liberal-Nationals were a driving force for the recovery of the affected areas. Many of the young people were students of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        which was greatly affected. They assisted in the recovery efforts of the campus and the surrounding residential areas. In the proud tradition of conservative politics, the youth wing of the LNP supports small business. In the tradition of youth politics, many of those small businesses are located in the entertainment districts of the towns in which they actively engage. Most of the small businesses that they support are the local clubs and pubs. With the upcoming state election in Queensland, they have what they call flying squads. These flying squads go out and help the likes of 'Can-do'

        to try to ensure that they get him elected as the next

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I started as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_LNP" rel="nofollow">
         Young LNP
        </a>
        in Queensland. I believe that I was tricked into joining that organisation. I heard an invitation to come to a party, so I rolled up with a carton of beer only to find out that I was the only one with a carton of beer. It happened to be the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        of the local LNP branch meeting. Being the only one at the AGM with beer, I got elected as the next branch chairman. I thought if I were going to run the show, everyone would have to bring their own beer from then on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage these young, motivated professionals to keep going with their political pursuits. I thank my colleagues who warmly welcomed this group to this place. I trust that their relationships from their initial encounters today were beneficial not only to them but to the members they met. I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, you may have started in the party as a member of the youth wing as well. I encourage this fine group of young Australians to continue to pursue their political goals. Each of them should note that if there is anything I can do to assist them in their political endeavours, I am more than happy to do so. I take this opportunity to thank them for their commitment to the party and I wish them every success. I also compliment them on the professional way in which they have conducted themselves whilst in this House and whilst in my presence.

         I must confess to the House that I was a state president of the Young Nationals.
