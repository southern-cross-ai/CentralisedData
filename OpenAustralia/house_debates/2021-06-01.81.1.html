         I thank the member for her question. The Morrison government knows that the safety and security of our families and communities is central to what makes Australia great. That's why we've maintained our strong borders, which has kept Australians safe and secure during this pandemic. But we also know that COVID is not the only threat to our community's safety. Organised crime gangs have found new ways to adapt and grow their evil trade in the COVID environment, whether it's preying on vulnerable people who are spending more time online or using the dark web to offer a range of illicit products and services, including child sexual abuse. Also, as our ports and airports have adapted to changing demands, they are being targeted by criminal gangs as gateways for drugs and weapons trafficking—drugs and weapons that can only end up on our streets, making them less safe for mums, for dads, for kids, for grandparents and, of course, for all of our individuals right through our Australian society.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is not the Australian way and not something that we will tolerate under our watch. That's why we are tackling organised crime and unlawful gangs across all our national security agencies, including through the specialised national task force Morpheus, which targets the highest-risk outlaw motorcycle gangs. It is also why we are delivering a funding boost in the budget of almost $52 million for the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and almost $60 million for the

           <p>
            As soon as we start to make the point that this government is absolutely committed to keeping our community safe, the interjections start from those opposite. That is a very good indication of the softness that those opposite have on crime and how the Morrison government has always had the strength to stand up to outlaw motorcycle gangs and to stand up to criminals in our community. We will not be taking a backward step, because we know that during COVID that activity has not stopped and there have been many opportunities for those that engage in that illicit conduct to actually escalate the work that they are doing in our communities. I would encourage those opposite to start having a good look around themselves and to make sure that they are standing up—

              interjecting
             </a>
             . I'm going to say to the minister: I heard one or two interjections that I couldn't decipher, and the response to that has now caused a wave of interjections. She was asked a very specific question. We have instances where ministers say they will take the interjection. They have no right to take the interjection. If anyone is going to intervene, I will. There is not an opportunity to give those on the other side a character assessment. You weren't asked about that, because it's not within the standing orders.
