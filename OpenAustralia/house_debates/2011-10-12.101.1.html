        Mr Speaker, I would normally ask this of you privately but, given that there was a fairly public event from the gallery this afternoon, could you ascertain whether any of those people who were removed from the gallery were signed in to this chamber by members of the House of Representatives and report back?

         Order! Everybody will sit down. I was not going to respond to the Leader of the House's question but, encouraged by everybody who has to have a comment, if you want me to investigate this morning, I will investigate this morning—but have the decency to get up and put your name to that question. And remember that the gallery where that occurred this morning is the public gallery. The difference is that the gallery where it occurred this afternoon is a gallery where people get allocated tickets that have been asked for by members. I would hope that some people would adopt some care about raising these issues without understanding what has happened both today, possibly, and previously. There is a responsibility on members who sign guests into this place, and from time to time members are reminded of those responsibilities. Quite correctly, not much public attention is given to that, so please tread carefully. All I am saying is that there is a responsibility on those who sign people in for their behaviour.
