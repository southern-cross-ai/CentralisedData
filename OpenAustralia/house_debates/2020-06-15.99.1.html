        Will the Prime Minister reverse his decision to deny

          Teddy Sheean
         </a>
         is not under question. He was an incredible and brave Australian, like 40,000 others who lost their lives during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . Each and every day of those six years, acts of bravery, acts of selflessness and acts of sacrifice took place. At that time, over the course of that campaign, there were a small number of Victoria crosses that were handed out. And there were a very small number who were mentioned honourably in dispatches, particularly from the Navy, and Teddy Sheean was one of those.

         When you look back into the history, 80 years ago, you've got to be very careful about putting yourself in the position of those who stood before you and made these decisions. All I'm seeking to do is assure myself, with the responsibilities that I have, that the policy test that was adopted by the previous government can be held by our government. There needs to be compelling new evidence that would justify the revisiting of that award. The valour inquiry found there wasn't. There has been a subsequent tribunal which was not reviewing the decision of the valour inquiry but was initiated by a separate process. Each of those inquiries have come to different conclusions, so I am simply seeking to honour the system. I have advice from the

          The interjections come from those opposite. I sought advice from the

           CDF
          </a>
          and I have accepted his advice, but I have also asked for this very specific issue to be addressed. I'm simply seeking to preserve the integrity of the honours and awards system, and I will receive that advice from the eminent Australians Dr Nelson, Dr Shergold, Brad Manera and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bennett" rel="nofollow">
           David Bennett

          for the constructive engagement I've had with them. They have been engaging with me on this issue for some time. I've respected and appreciated their meetings with me. We are working through this issue. We just have to make a decision that is consistent with government policy and respects the honours and awards system. But I want to make this very clear:
