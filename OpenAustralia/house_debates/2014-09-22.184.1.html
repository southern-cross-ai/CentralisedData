        Last week I was privileged to attend a number of year 12 farewells and presentations in the electorate. I was overwhelmed by the quality and the achievements of the young people who were present at these presentation nights. Each year, I award a prize at most of these schools, and the prize generally is for citizenship. This year at Whitebridge High School Shanara Stanek won the prize for citizenship. At Swansea High School it was

        It is phenomenal that we have young people finishing 13 years of education and going out into the workforce, into study, having achieved so much and having so much to offer our Australian community. We need to embrace them. We need to provide them with every opportunity possible so they can move from school to work and along the way develop the qualifications they need.
