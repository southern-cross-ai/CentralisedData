        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. The Australian Audit Office told Senate estimates last night that it had provided information to the Federal Police on 10 July about the possible defrauding of the Commonwealth. Does the Deputy Prime Minister still say paying $30 million for a piece of land valued at $3 million is a bargain?

         Whilst I appreciate this is the subject of many inquiries being made by Senate estimates, as you would expect—the

          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         are looking into it and the

          ANAO
         </a>
         has referred this matter to the

          AFP
         </a>
         , as has the secretary of the department of infrastructure, and of course an independent investigation is also going into the matter, being conducted by the Commonwealth Ombudsman Dr Vivienne Thom, or, I should say, former Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and Commonwealth Ombudsman, Dr Vivienne Thom; they are all looking into the sale of that particular land—in time, people will look back at this moment and say: 'Well, thankfully, the Commonwealth invested in that in 2020.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, as I've said, over and over, again and again, it was paid at way over the odds. I acknowledge that. I recognise that. The government has said that.
        </p>
        <p>
         In time, people will say: 'Well, thankfully, the Commonwealth owns this land, and now we can build a second runway; now we can build supporting infrastructure to help the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney

         Airport.' As I stated in my previous answer, with 11,000 jobs during construction and 28,000 jobs within five years of opening in 2026, this is going to be and is a significant investment in Western Sydney.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2009, the member for Grayndler said: 'It is vital we commence work now.' That's what he said. He wanted it started in 2009. I'm quoting him about Western Sydney Airport and the value of it. I see you're just about to jump out like a racehorse at the spring carnival, but this is what the member for Grayndler said. He said that it was vital that we commence work now. Well, it took a Liberal-Nationals government to get on with it. It took us to build it. And that's what we're doing.
