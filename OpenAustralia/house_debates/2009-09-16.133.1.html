        I present this petition, which has been approved by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions. The petition is from the citizens of Trundle and surrounding areas and draws the attention of the House to the impending closure of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Bank
        </a>
        in Trundle. I support this petition and ask the House to intervene on their behalf to retain full banking facilities in Trundle.

        The petition read as follows—

        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of the Citizens of Trundle and surrounding area draws to the attention of the House: of the pending closure of the Commonwealth Bank in Trundle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We understand there is a proposal to transfer banking facilities to the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Post Office
        </a>
        ; this will include deposits, withdrawals and account enquiries. Unfortunately, this is unsuitable for the elderly and disabled as the access is unsuitable. If customers want full banking facilities they will need to travel to the Parkes branch. Trundle is situated approximately 68kms from Parkes in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Parkes Shire
        </a>
        . We are a small rural community with no public transport and rely on local businesses and facilities to meet our daily needs. For some, it is almost impossible to travel to the larger centres.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Trundle has a large number of elderly citizens, with most of them using Gophers to get around. This helps them to keep a certain amount of independence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to intervene on our behalf and help us to retain full banking facilities in our town.

        I have another duty which I am honoured but very saddened to do, and that is to bring to the House’s attention the fact that yesterday afternoon the former mayor of Parkes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Wilson
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , died near the town of Manildra, between Parkes and Orange. He did not survive a car crash. Robert Wilson was described by a previous Premier of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        as the ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman" rel="nofollow">
         Don Bradman
        </a>
        of local government’. He was the mayor of Parkes for well over 20 years. He was the mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan_Gate" rel="nofollow">
         Bogan Gate
        </a>
        municipal council prior to that. He was in local government for over 40 years. He and his wife, Vicki—who obviously has the sympathy of everyone in the Calare electorate and, I am sure, my colleagues—were a part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">
         Central West
        </a>
        for as long as I can remember. I was asked today on air how long I had known Robert, and I was not able to say. Robert has always been there. He was one of the leaders that you have to have.
       </p>
       <p>
        While a lot of people would remember Robert Wilson for his local issues—and he was very good on those—he never, ever lost sight of the big picture. He was fixated on the fact—and he was totally correct—that transport extended from that region right across Australia. He did more than any individual could have expected to do in his years in local government to ensure that Parkes would become the transport hub not just of eastern Australia but, to a large extent, of Australia both by road and by rail. Robert oversaw Parkes going from a large country town to what it is today: almost a de facto city because of its position, its expansion and what it has been able to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert was recognised by politicians and local government members in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" rel="nofollow">
         Great Britain
        </a>
        and Australia. Everywhere he went he was recognised as a passionate, articulate and entirely sensible advocate for Australia, for the Central West and for Parkes, in particular. He and Vicki were part of the scene for as long as I can remember. His deputy of about 13 or 14 years,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Keith" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Keith
        </a>
        , had been the Mayor or Parkes since Robert retired, around 14 months ago. Ken said recently:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Robert Wilson took Parkes 20-odd years ago and he rode with it till the day he died.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only about three weeks ago Robert rang me, still lobbying on behalf of people in his region on more than one issue. He could not leave it all alone and he will not at any stage be forgotten for his job there.
