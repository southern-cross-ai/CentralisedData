        My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that Innisfail’s South Johnstone mill, in perfect order, was sold by a liquidator for around $15 million to a company that had, at the time, built a mill with half South Johnstone’s capacity for reportedly $85 million? Much worse, this sale took place when the liquidator was aware of a second offer coming forward, involving existing farm owners and four of Queensland’s most reputable companies. Without even knowing what this offer entailed, the liquidator sold to the first offeror, a major customer of the mortgagee. Since mortgagors are sold up like this regularly, inflicting similar hardship, could the minister assure the House that his officers, already doing a very good job, will set a good example and pursue this case to the conclusion which the interests of justice and equity demand?

         I thank the member for Kennedy for that very important question. As a Queenslander and someone who has been associated with the sugar industry for much of my life I had a very good visit to North Queensland about a month ago. I went to Townsville, first of all, to talk to resource companies about the copper string project, about a transmission line between

         and Townsville of vital importance to energy supply in the north-west and also of very great potential in terms of renewable energy. We then proceeded further north to the Victoria mill, one of the largest mills in Australia. The thing I can say is that I am an optimist about the future of the sugar industry in this country. I do believe it has a bright future and that it is a very good example of what we can do if we get all the policy settings right. I believe there is more that we can do for our great sugar industry to make sure that it continues to prosper. It is such a vital source of employment, particularly in

         but also along the Queensland coast further south and, of course, into northern

         </a>
         . The member asked me about the particular case of the South Johnstone mill. I can assure him that I will follow up with the responsible regulator to ensure that everything is done that can be done to ensure that the law has been properly observed.
