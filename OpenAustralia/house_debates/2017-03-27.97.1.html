        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. Will the minister update the House on the Turnbull government's significant infrastructure investment in South-East Queensland, including in my electorate of Forde, and how the delivery of projects like the M1 upgrades will support jobs and economic development in South-East Queensland.

         I thank the member for Forde for this very important question. He is a member who is committed to delivering outcomes for his constituents. Over the weekend, we saw a very significant announcement delivering outcomes for the people of South-East Queensland—over $500 million of infrastructure investment from the Turnbull government and the Queensland government in South-East Queensland and throughout Queensland. The M1 Pacific Motorway will be widened from four lanes to six lanes between Mudgeeraba and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
          Varsity Lakes
         </a>
         . The M1 Pacific Motorway intersection with the

          Eight Mile Plains
         </a>
         will be substantially upgraded to reduce that significant bottleneck for southbound motorists. The Mt Lindesay Highway between

          Browns Plains

         and Beaudesert will be significantly upgraded and the Walkerston Bypass near Mackay will also be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a lot of credit that needs to go around for these very significant achievements, because there has been advocacy on behalf of the electorate by the member for Forde, who has done a terrific job—a terrific outcome. The member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
          McPherson
         </a>
         has done an extraordinary job in delivering for her electorate. The member for Fadden and the member for Moncrieff have done extraordinary jobs. The member for Wright has done a remarkable job.

         team are delivering for their electorates. Of course, we also need to give credit to the member for Dawson for the Walkerston bypass. The LNP team in Queensland is delivering outcomes. There is a lot of credit to go around, because this is a very significant achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I will tell you who should not get any credit—it is this lot. This lot deserve no credit. Of course, the shadow minister has the hide of an elephant, so he puts out a media release on Sunday trying to claim credit. You have to read through this entire media release and nowhere do you find the statement, 'Labor committed zero for the Mudgeeraba to Varsity Lakes upgrade.' Nowhere do you find that statement. I think this shadow minister needs to talk to the shadow minister for regional communications. They need some remedial lessons in how to write a media release that tells the truth: 'We committed zero.' Because that is what Labor is good at. There was zero for the Mudgeeraba to Varsity Lakes upgrade. This government, together with the Queensland government, committed over $500 million. This is good news for people who use the M1 every day between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and Brisbane. This is the LNP Queensland team delivering for the people of Queensland. The member for Forde, the member for McPherson and the LNP Queensland team: the Turnbull government delivering.
