        I recently wrote to the minister for social services about an issue that hits home for so many residents across the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        . The National Disability Insurance Agency and Early Childhood Early Intervention are essential services for families all over Australia and in communities throughout McEwen. In 2019, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        will finally be rolled out across parts of McEwen, specifically reaching the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Shire
        </a>
        Council. Intereach, who are currently delivering the service to the

         Goulburn Valley
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon_Ranges" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , will be partnering with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        to provide the same services in Mitchell Shire. I welcome the contribution that they make. However, a decision has been made to establish their business in Seymour. Currently, Intereach has an office in Shepparton and is offering support from the Seymour medical service while they find a permanent office. However, the residents of Seymour have already been accessing NDIA services through the established offices just up the road in Shepparton. We, as a community, are very concerned about the decision of where to locate the new NDIA hub for the Mitchell Shire, especially when it comes to early childhood services.

        The population of southern Mitchell towns, like Wallan, Kilmore and Beveridge, is booming with young families who are making the region home in unprecedented numbers. This means that southern Mitchell has an above-average proportion of children between the ages of zero and six. Our region is growing fast and the opportunities are endless, but the government's subpar performance in infrastructure and services means they are not growing with us. Most of the residents of Mitchell Shire access work, school, shopping, medical services and social engagements in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, generally choosing not to take the 50-minute drive up the road to Seymour. I've heard from countless young families and parents who don't know where to turn for local support. They're spending precious time and money and experiencing stress in driving the long distances required to access the services for their kids. Those two hours a day on the road add another layer of burden onto families doing their best to support their kids to grow and to learn.

        Data from the ABS and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHS" rel="nofollow">
         DHS
        </a>
        shows that the majority of people with disability are in the south of Mitchell Shire. With the rapid growth in our region, that number is set to increase and increase rapidly. Meanwhile, participation in the north stagnates. Southern Mitchell has a greater need for disability support pension services, which is obvious just by looking at the numbers. In Seymour, around 476 residents are accessing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
         DSP
        </a>
        , compared to almost 1,000 residents accessing the DSP in southern Mitchell Shire. The ECEI needs to be based where young families and large numbers of children are. That is plain to see. It is in the south of Mitchell Shire. We've got to continue to fight against this government because of its failure with the NDIA, particularly through the hapless minister and parliamentary secretary, who have yet to respond to community concerns. We need to make sure that we get the best opportunity for our families and make sure the minister actually responds to this decision and starts helping the people in our community who need help the most.
