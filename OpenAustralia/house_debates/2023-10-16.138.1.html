        The results of the referendum on Saturday left many in our community feeling disappointed and disheartened. Firstly, I would like to extend my gratitude and care to all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        people. We value your longstanding connection to our country and express our sadness that the modest request of the Uluru Statement from the Heart was not accepted by the Australian people. Although we are saddened, we accept the voice of and the decision made by the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although I am disappointed, I also feel incredibly proud of my community in Macnamara. We have created a formidable movement of more than 1,000 volunteers, all dedicated to recognition and reconciliation. Macnamara delivered the sixth-highest 'yes' vote in all of Australia, and the third-highest in Victoria. Every single polling booth in our electorate on the day said yes to the Voice, with the majority of them doing so by extraordinary margins. A shout-out to St Kilda Primary School, who delivered and returned an 81 per cent 'yes' vote.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our campaign brought people together from all political persuasions. I was proud to campaign alongside members of the Liberal Party, the Greens and anyone else who was part of this movement. It was the first time many people had ever campaigned or engaged in a political campaign. We were guided by our local Indigenous people and leaders, like N'arweet Dr Carolyn Briggs, Aunty Jacko, Aunty Janet and, of course, the incredible people like Shelley Ware and

        who inspired us throughout the campaign. These bonds that were formed and promises made for a brighter future will not be forgotten. This is not the end, and there is more to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I have a few people to thank. Thank you to Lachlan and Ella, our extremely dedicated captains for Macnamara for Yes. They are great people, and I'm very proud of them. Thank you to our hardworking area volunteer coordinators and vice-captains, Catherine, James, Jane S, Nick, Janet, Sean, Dave, Jane K, Jo and Keryn. And I'll give a special shout-out to Zarina, who walked with

        from Melbourne to Canberra and campaigned every single day after that until the referendumâ€”amazing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to South Port Uniting Church for kindly donating a space for our campaign headquarters. Thank you to Port Phillip Citizens for Reconciliation for your commitment to justice and recognition, which began long before our campaign. Thank you to everyone who volunteered, doorknocked and picked up the phone. None of the results that we helped deliver in Macnamara would have been possible without you. Now we pick ourselves up for a better future together.
