        It gives me the utmost pleasure to rise and speak about the Cairns Men's Shed. During the election campaign, the Morrison government made a $1 million commitment to the members of the Cairns shed that would allow the club to purchase its existing premises and undertake further expansion. I've worked extremely closely with the Cairns Men's Shed president, Bob Lavington, over a number of years to secure the much-needed funding. I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the previous work of Clive Lee and

        in securing the club's future. I can honestly say this investment will make a real and very significant difference to the hundreds of men who use the Cairns Men's Shed on a daily basis.

        The Cairns Men's Shed has come along in leaps and bounds over the past few years and is widely regarded as one of the best sheds around. However, all men's sheds, no matter how big or small, offer fantastic support to men who might need space and friendly, easygoing company. Men are often the last ones to treat their health and wellbeing as a priority. It is imperative that we do what we can to ensure that they get the support they need and deserve. I'm very fortunate to have several wonderful men's sheds in my electorate, including

        and Aurukun. The Men's Shed initiative is something that both sides of politics should be extremely proud of because, put simply, it's saving lives. It is a wonderful initiative.
