        For five years now, I have been a patron of the Belconnen Magpies Aussie Rules football club. It is a club with a proud history—originally known as Turner Football Club, then the Bees and then the Blues. Then, after its merger with the West Canberra Football Club, it became the Belconnen Magpies in 1987 and moved to its headquarters in Kippax in 1991. Although I have not gotten to as many games as I would like to this year, I did get out to 'The Nest' at Kippax to see the Magpies' convincing 118-35 victory against the Ainslie Tricolours on 29 August. The

        competition grand final was held on 19 September. Playing in both the first and second grade matches were, of course, the Magpies. Alas—despite a thrilling semifinal victory against Tuggeranong on 5 September—the first grade side was narrowly upset by Queanbeyan, 95-71.

        second grade team also fought to the end, but ultimately went down to Tuggeranong 87-39.

        The 2014 year was a tough one for the Belconnen Magpies. Fighting in the highly competitive North East Australian Football League, success was elusive, and the club was ultimately relegated to the ACT AFL competition. The Magpies now find themselves towards the top of the pecking order in the ACT. The club has amply proven its worth and, during the entire normal season, the first grade side was undefeated. The players, staff and entire club—especially coach Jeremy Rowe—can be incredibly proud of their efforts.

        Let me indulge the House with a few of their season highlights. First and second grade both claimed minor premierships, finishing top of their respective ladders. Third and fourth grade missed out on making the finals, but each fought tough and creditable seasons. Statistically, the first grade side was by far the best attacking and the best defending team in the competition. In terms of individual achievements, first grader

        had a breakout season, kicking 80 'sausage rolls' in 15 games. Club stalwart Lex Bennett played his 200th first grade game for Belconnen against Queanbeyan on 30 May—only the sixth player in the club's history to achieve this milestone. The Magpies field teams in a range of divisions and in both genders. It was great to see them winning the girls youth competition, defeating Ainslie Black 21-10 in the grand final, with Alexia Hamilton winning best on ground for the Magpies.

        An improvement on their sometimes antisocial namesake, the Magpies have swooped on social causes this year, throwing the energy of the club behind a number of community initiatives. During their first set of home games, the Magpies collected donations for a rare cancers charity and held a minute's silence before each game, with players wearing black armbands in honour of Canberra mother Rachael Netting, whose husband, Paul, played more than 300 games for the Magpies. Rachael passed away earlier this year after a battle with cancer. During the match against Ainslie that I attended, the Magpies dedicated their games and a special function to raising funds for Lifeline Canberra.

        I hope 2016 will bring even more successes. Perhaps a Magpies grand final win and a Labor election win in the same year. I cannot imagine a happier thing for a Canberra based politician than to see a Shorten government and a Magpies victory in the same year.
