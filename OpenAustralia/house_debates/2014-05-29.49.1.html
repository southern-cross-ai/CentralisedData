       <p>
        Three months' worth of rain falling over a few days has triggered the worst flooding in a century sweeping through Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia. While the death toll is, thankfully, low, thousands of homes are destroyed, multiple numbers of people are displaced, roads are ruined and there is a repair bill in the billions.
       </p>
       <p>
        These countries might sit in Europe, but they are not the strongest economically. Their need is great. Please consider this point: the after-effects of this flood are explosiveâ€”literally. Last week alone there were seven instances of exploding mines and ordnance set off by floodwater currents. Fortunately there were no deaths, but imagine being a rescuer working in that?
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not a normal flood, but the silence and lack of world reaction is definitely unusual. Australians of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian backgrounds are deeply distressed that these floods have failed to get anyone's attention or care. But they are working arm in arm to help.

        Last week I personally tried to get some non-government organisations to set up local funds to funnel the local support that is surging forward to aid people in need. Amazingly, these

        s and said 'no'. Locals are fundraising furiously. In Dandenong, the local Serbian community has raised over $200,000. I visited the Bosnian community in

        and they are gearing up to donate nearly $50,000. But they are being told to donate to agencies in country or to make their own arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have appreciated the chance to talk with foreign minister Bishop about this. I understand that the government has pre-positioned funds, but something terrible is unfolding here and we need to be ready to provide meaningful support to help people help themselves.
