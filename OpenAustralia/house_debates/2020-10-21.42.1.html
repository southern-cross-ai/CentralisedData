        On 22 October, the Warradale Primary School community will celebrate their 60th birthday. Warradale primary has a rich history. As Adelaide's population grew with the post World War

        baby boom and overseas migration, so did the need for a new primary school in the area. To meet the demand driven by local families, Warradale Primary School was built on repurposed orchards and opened in May 1960 with 274 students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fast forward to 2020 and the school boasts 376 students and 26 teachers, led by Principal Josh Vick and Deputy Principal Sarah French. Warradale has an active governing council, chaired by Mrs Carol Douglas, and it also manages the operation of the Warradale Urban Camp School, which is co-located on the site. The urban camp school was established in 1983 and provides low-cost accommodation for students from isolated regional areas who are visiting Adelaide for educational and sporting activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warradale Primary School is a very environmentally conscious school and has a number of initiatives, including eight vegie patches, a native food trail and a wetlands program run in conjunction with the urban camp school. I have been delighted to visit Warradale primary over my years as the member for Boothby, including their breakfast club. I have welcomed many of their year 6 and year 7 students to

        as well. I wish Warradale primary and its school community a very happy 60th birthday.
