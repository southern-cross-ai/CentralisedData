        and Territories. How is the Albanese Labor government investing in regional Australia and easing the cost-of-living pressures on regional Australians—the ones that they face? What policies has the government rejected for regional Australia?

         I want to thank the member for Paterson for that question—she's an amazing fighter for her local community—the community in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens" rel="nofollow">
          Port Stephens
         </a>
         , which will now be receiving an extra $3 million under the Roads to Recovery Program, bringing their five-year funding to $6.86 million. That's because on this side of the House we believe in assisting every regional community for better roads, not just some.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the last two years, I've travelled across Australia and spoken to many communities about the cost-of-living pressures, and it's why this government is taking action. In five days we will see real cost-of-living relief provided to regional Australians, with the average taxpayer receiving $1,888. That is how to deliver cost-of-living relief, not by pushing up power prices with nuclear reactors. On this side of the House, we know that power prices are a serious issue for regional Australians. That's why we're working hard to create a reliable and realistic energy future. Our Reliable Renewables plan is the only plan supported by experts to deliver the clean, cheap, reliable and resilient energy that the Australians of this country deserve. On this side of the House, in only a few short days time we will be taking $300 off power bills. But we see that the Leader of the Opposition will take about two decades to serve up the most expensive form of energy that there is.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         figures show us that this is the most expensive form of energy; it is up to eight times more expensive than firmed renewables. While we're delivering energy security, they're delivering press releases, and while we're out talking to regional Australians, they're talking to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite put out a plan, but it's probably better referred to as a pipedream. They didn't even bother to call the mayors in the areas where those seven reactors would be hosted. They're pushing action off into the never-never. In complete contrast, Labor is delivering a plan to put regional Australia at the heart of our Future Made in Australia, backed by $22.7 billion of investment in the budget to unlock economic opportunities across industries like green metals, low-carbon fuels, critical minerals and clean energy manufacturing. It's a plan that uses local skills, which supports making more things in our own backyard and which invests in our local workforce. That's how to deliver growth for regional communities—not waiting for another decade to tick by with the delays and excuses for a new power source, only to have to pay more for it. We're serious about delivering cost-of-living relief, unlike those opposite. And we're doing it by delivering tax cuts and energy reform now, not by pushing up power prices by delivering nuclear reactors in decades to come.

         <p>
          My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, the National Seniors Social Survey paints a stark picture of life for older Australia struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. Many older Australians are foregoing basics like fresh fruit and milk, and stockpiling petrol to make ends meet. One Queensland woman wrote that she has to choose between seeing her grandchildren or affording medical treatment. Isn't this another example of Labor's homegrown inflation making life harder for our most vulnerable?

          </small>
          <p>
           I thank the member for Maranoa, the Leader of the National Party, for his question. Indeed, we recognise many Australians are doing it tough. People who are on a fixed income, particularly if they're retired and pensioners, do it tough in Australian society. That's why the support you spoke about, if they're in Queensland—not just the $300 energy bill relief; that will be on top of the relief the Queensland government announced in its budget just a short time ago. That will bring that support to well over $1,000 as a result. In addition to that, I have spoken to people in the great state of Queensland—I'll say that just once today, given circumstances later this evening! I've spoken to people who have an energy bill of zero as a result of the support of state and federal governments to make an enormous difference.
          </p>
          <p>
           The second thing is people who are pensioners will be far more likely to need pharmaceuticals than you or myself. The difference it's made in having the reduction, firstly, from 1 January last year, of $42.50 down to $30—and in addition to that, the freeze will make an enormous difference. On top of that, 60-day dispensing, which literally cuts costs in half, has made an enormous difference to our older Australians who rely upon pharmaceuticals for various health conditions. In addition to that, one of the things the health minister has done regularly is list pharmaceuticals in regular use—not wait but list at regular intervals—to make a substantial difference, so they can receive that support.
          </p>
          <p>
           We understand cost-of-living pressures are the No. 1 priority, and that's precisely why we've put in place measures that are designed to put that downward pressure on inflation. That also makes a difference, and that's why as well—I know the Leader of the National Party wants divestment of supermarkets, but that's why we regarded that as not being an appropriate response. Dr Emerson's report made it clear as well that we have a mandating rather than a voluntary code of conduct—something that was never done by those opposite. They sat there—
