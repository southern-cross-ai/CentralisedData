       <p>
        Earlier today the House suspended the Manager of Opposition Business for 24 hours for defying the chair. The circumstances were that the opposition manager moved a motion including unparliamentary terms that had been included in a motion on 25 May moved by the Leader of the House when I was not in the chair. As the official record shows, last week the House resolved that the motion put to the House was in order by negativing a motion of dissent from the Deputy Speakerâ€™s ruling to that effect. I also note that, when I resumed the chair on 25 May, the Leader of the House withdrew the offensive expressions unconditionally.
       </p>
       <p>
        This morning I requested, as Speaker, that the same unparliamentary expressions be withdrawn without reservation.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manager" rel="nofollow">
         The Manager
        </a>
        of Opposition Business declined to do so. This constitutes defiance of the chair which, in the interests of orderly proceedings, cannot be tolerated. I would expect all occupants of the chair to act as I did this morning. In the interests of the way in which the House is perceived, I would request all members to ensure that the language they use in the House is characterised by good temper and moderation and that the directions given by the chair are complied with. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate that unparliamentary expressions should be withdrawn without reservation.
