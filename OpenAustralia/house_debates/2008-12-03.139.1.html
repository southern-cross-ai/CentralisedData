        In the past week Darwin has mourned the loss of some very respected and loved Territorians. Xavier

        ’s College. In 1972 Xavier started a surveying cadetship, a career that he would do with professionalism, enthusiasm and expertise his entire working life, working for local companies such as Gutheridge, Hastings and Davey; Qasco; and, in his later years, Earl James and Associates. Xavier married

        . Xavier himself played for St Marys from 1964 to 1983, an amazing 20 years. He played in three senior premierships and in 1972 kicked the winning point in the grand final. But his greatest love was Pam and his family. He spent many hours fishing, camping and hunting with them. Xavier fought a brave and inspiring fight against cancer. His pain came to an end on 24 November. Rest in peace,

        Mark James Grosvenor was born in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to Malcolm and Rosemary on 15 January 1969. His family moved to Darwin three weeks after his birth and stayed for three years but returned to South Australia. In 1984 the family moved back to Darwin and Mark completed his high school education at Casuarina Secondary College. An electrician by trade, Mark worked in this trade while learning to fly fixed-wing aircraft. Flying was his passion. He also loved adventure, spending time on his weekends with the Leech family, working cattle and hunting. It was at Ringwood that Mark got his first taste of helicopter mustering. It is this taste that he would pursue.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1996 Mark decided it was time to go out on his own, and Albatross Helicopters was born with one

        helicopter. It has grown to a fleet of 13 and is the Territory’s largest chopper fleet. Another great love of Mark’s life was sprint car racing, and he commenced racing in 1997, which was a big year for Mark, as he also met Belinda. Many of Mark’s friends could not believe he could convince this beautiful, intelligent and talented woman to move to his one-room donga in Noonamah. The birth of Madeline in November last year saw Mark take on his favourite role in life—a devoted father. Mark passed away after an aircraft crash last week. He is mourned by his family, his many friends and the communities throughout the Territory. Rest in peace, Mark.

        was also killed in that accident. Campbell leaves behind a two-year-old daughter and his wife, Tracy, who was pregnant with their second child. I offer my condolences to the families of these three fine men.
