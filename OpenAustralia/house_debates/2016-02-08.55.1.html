        My question is to the Treasurer. The government has previously said that everything was on the table in relation to changing the tax system. Treasurer, is that still the case?

         The government continue to consider all the matters that are before us on tax, as I think the Australian people would expect us to do. The member who asked the question would know about keeping things on the table, because scenario 3, as we recall, when he was Treasurer, was an increase in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         rate to 12½ per cent and broadening its base. That was the matter that was being kept on the table by the member for McMahon. So the government will continue to consider all these matters very soberly and carefully to ensure that we make the right decision, the right economic decision, for jobs and growth—because that is our focus.
        </p>
        <p>
         Wherever the government are able to properly and ably deliver support for those Australians who are working and saving and investing, for those Australians who are earning every day—not just receiving every day but earning every day—we will always seek to ensure that we leave no stone unturned to ensure that we can provide them with support. But these proposals always have to stack up and they always have to work, and this is a government that is not only good on policy but good on the implementation of policy—something the Prime Minister was referring to earlier when he was referring to a very different matter, when it came to border protection. And the member for McMahon will know all about failures when it comes to implementation on border protection.
