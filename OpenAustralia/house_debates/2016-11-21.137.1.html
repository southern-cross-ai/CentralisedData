        I rise in this place this evening to talk about a growing and not-so-silent epidemic in my electorate of Herbert, and that is the scourge of methamphetamine or, as it is commonly known, ice. The spike in this drug's prevalence in Australia has been widespread, and regional Queensland is certainly not immune. There is no group of people or social demographic that is immune or not vulnerable to this epidemic. I was recently talking to a professional in the legal field who told me of a gentleman aged 65 years who was in the Townsville court system for the first time in his life as a result of his addiction to ice. He has never committed a crime in his life. His addiction is destroying his life and his relationships.

        Families across

        are feeling the effects of the drug ice, with the number of people seeking help for amphetamine addiction in Townsville rising by 165 per cent since 2010. There is no youth drug and alcohol detox facility north of Brisbane, with young people who wish to seek treatment being required to travel as far away as Melbourne due to the pressure on the service in Brisbane. This means that many young people do not get access to treatment, and this is especially the case for Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        youth. Regional Queensland is crying for out drug and alcohol detox and rehabilitation services. Recently a desperate Queensland mother built a cage to house her son who was caught in the grip of the ice epidemic. Whilst I do not condone this action, it needs to be acknowledged that this is the act of desperate and distressed mother. This action clearly demonstrates the total lack of services in regional Queensland communities.

        government has done little to nothing to address this desperate and destructive situation. The Prime Minister launched his '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICE" rel="nofollow">
         ICE
        </a>
        task force' some time ago and to date it has delivered nothing. The announcement was a bravado act and nothing more than just that. Whilst the government has announced the ICE task force, it has also cut millions upon millions of dollars to frontline services that work to support people dealing with drug addiction. This government has cut millions from the health flexible funds, which includes funds to support drug treatment services and prevention strategies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liberal-National governments also have a propensity to cut prevention and early intervention services, and it is very clear that this investment is the most effective and cost-efficient solution. I suggest that, instead of this government focussing on people coming into Australia by boat—which they say they have fixed—maybe they could instead turn their attention to the illegal drugs that are killing our youth and other members of our communities across the nation—and these are truly are coming in illegally by boat!
       </p>
       <p>
        During the recent election campaign, I was the only candidate in Queensland who committed funds towards a drug and alcohol detox and rehabilitation centre. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        have been fundraising for over five years to include a youth drug and alcohol detox and rehabilitation centre in their much-needed new Townsville complex.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         The Salvation Army
        </a>
        's Townsville facility is both almost ready to be condemned and so overcrowded and booked out that they have had to turn away people who desperately need help. The people addicted to ICE are also often living with mental health conditions, which makes treatment complex and difficult. Our communities in regional Queensland need action and we need it now. We do not want some bravado announcement of a task force; we want facilities, treatment centres and something that can deliver action on this important issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been numerous reviews into the issues surrounding drug addiction and treatment. Let's not waste any more time or money on countless task forces and useless talk. Let's just get down to business and commit to action and support services. Drug addiction is also linked to poverty, homelessness and crime. We cannot talk about one without the other. Townsville is currently in the grip of an ICE epidemic, which is also contributing to our youth crime. I stand here today demanding that the Turnbull government takes this issue seriously and delivers the funds required to provide the much-needed drug and alcohol detox and rehabilitation services in Townville.
