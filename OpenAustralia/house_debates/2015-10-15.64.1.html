        from Dobell is worried about her daughter and two grandchildren, aged eight and five. Jill says her daughter is starting to feel panicked because this government wants to stop paying family tax benefit part B to families once their youngest child turns six. Jill says her daughter relies on family tax benefits to help with the day-to-day costs of raising her kids. Will this government reverse its $3,000 a year cut to single income families?

         I thank the member opposite for her question. The question has got this very sharp ideological edge. Having inherited this portfolio, I do not see much ideology; I see practical layers of administrative problems. Here is where we are, as I think you know well deep down: 35 per cent of the national budget goes to welfare. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">
          DSS
         </a>
         budget is $154 billion a year. The income tax we bring in is $196 billion a year; 80 per cent of all income tax goes straight to the welfare budget. Of course, it has been growing very rapidly over time—as you know, because you were the steward of that rapid growth.

           What we look at when we look at this portfolio is very rapid growth over time. A decade ago, the portfolio had $83 billion worth of expenditure. Today, it has $154 billion worth of expenditure. In 2026, that will rise to $277 billion worth of expenditure. The difficulty is that you pretend that there is no need for expenditure restraint—none. What you have said and what everyone here has to realise—

               The member is quite right—I should get to the point of the family tax payments. The family tax benefits and the changes that we have proposed and are before the parliament that you are opposing are designed to pay for the childcare package that the Treasurer, when he was the minister, brought in. It is a childcare package that you support, and indeed when pressed on radio—

                   The family tax benefit changes that are proposed are linked to, and will pay for, the very good childcare measures that the Treasurer introduced.

                       The member for Jagajaga said, 'It does have to be paid for somehow.' And, in fact, we would agree with her that they do have to be paid for somehow. So the suggestion that we have before the parliament is that they should be changed by modest changes to the family tax benefit system and, in fact, by changes that do indeed encourage greater workforce participation. Family tax benefits at the moment, going back to the point of that welfare bill, are $20 billion a year of taxpayers' money going to families. We think a modest change to pay for the childcare package is a very good idea but, as the member for Jagajaga said, the financial reality is that that change to child care, which is very positive and which you seem to support, has to be paid for somehow.
