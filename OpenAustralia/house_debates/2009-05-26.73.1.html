       <p>
        John serviced Dungog council from 1959 to 2004, holding the position of mayor from 1962 to 1982. John was very much a hands-on practitioner of local government and he expected excellence, professionalism and devotion not only of himself but also of those around him. John’s 45 years of service saw achievements such as: the longest serving local government councillor in Australian history; the longest serving executive member of the

        of Australia New South Wales Branch was more than evident. His thanksgiving service bore testament to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking at John’s incredible tenure in local government one has to say that from humble beginnings he was truly a man for the people of the shire and very much a pioneer in local government in New South Wales. His outstanding achievements and commitments to his vocation were exemplary and will always be in keeping with the finest traditions of our Australian and rural heritage. This level of commitment does not come without great personal sacrifice, but John was a passionate advocate for the Dungog community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of John’s achievements forever entrenched in Dungog shire’s history are: the pioneering of the construction of Dungog Memorial Swimming Pool; the upgrading of Glendonbrook Road; the sealing of Stroud Road; and the reconstruction of Bingleburra Road to name but a few projects. John’s contribution to local government was strongly influenced by his work ethic. His most prominent mannerisms were created by friendships forged from common interests and a sense of camaraderie that manifested trust, loyalty and indeed a strong will to defend what some would call the underdog in all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no secret that John and I were on opposite sides of the political divide. However, there was a deep mutual respect for each other based on a common cause: fighting for our community above all else. When it comes to advocating for our community, it is the things that unite us that will always be stronger than the things that divide us. On behalf of the parliament, I extend to Mrs Elaine Hawley, and the Mitchell and Lyon families, our deepest sympathy and respect. John Graham Hawley OAM will be sadly missed by the Dungog community. He toiled hard for the community and now deserves his rest. May he rest in peace.
