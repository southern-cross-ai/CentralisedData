        have sponsored a sister school in Cambodia, raising $30,000 for infrastructure and educational tools.

        On Friday, I joined a brilliant group of students for a fundraising breakfast for their much-loved sister school 90 minutes from Phnom Penh. The students themselves—a fantastic case study of Australia's multiculturalism—told us how much they have learnt from this relationship and how much they have come to appreciate what they have, after seeing how little others have. They have also been using event management experience as part of their business course. Giving rewards the giver as much as it rewards recipient.

        The ANGKOR Project was established by educationalist John Garnaut and involves 28 schools across Perth. Under the leadership of Principal Gay Fortune, Morley Senior High School has been on board since the beginning. Not only have students raised money and visited the school but staff have volunteered their time, providing teachers with training and mentorship. One important project has been to fund the building of wells and toilets, which has seen girls remaining at school after puberty—a great leap forward. The project is now working with education authorities to assess the impact this school sponsorship has had on educational outcomes. Morley Senior High School, good on you for training your students to be good global citizens.
