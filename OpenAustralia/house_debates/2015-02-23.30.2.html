       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the amendment be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addressing the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 and the returns from the Senate, I am delighted to commend these amendments to the House. What they do, in short, is allow the long-held goal of ensuring there are increased penalties—indeed, a tripling of penalties—for killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping or moving a turtle or a dugong in a Commonwealth marine area and for taking or injuring turtles or dugongs within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        Marine Park.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is dugong and turtle protection legislation. It comes about because there have been those willing to abuse the good name, the good faith, the good history and the cultural intent of traditional owners. It is the traditional owners who have spoken with myself and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Entsch" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Entsch
        </a>
        , and with Colin Riddell and Rupert Imhoff, and sought this additional protection. It responds to their approaches; it responds to their stewardship; it responds to the fact that they themselves are the great custodians of the marine resources of the Great Barrier Reef and northern Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many traditional owners have spoken to me of people who have poached in their name and they have sought additional support. That support comes in the form of strong, tough legislation to protect these majestic marine creatures. It also comes in the form of a $5.3 million dugong and turtle protection plan, of which $2 million is going to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Crime Commission
        </a>
        . They are currently conducting an investigation into illegal fishing in the form it may take here but also with regard to broader criminal activities. In particular, there is a focus on anything which may be illegal foreign fishing within our waters, because it is certainly the case that there have been examples cited. I will leave the commission to produce its own report and its own decisions. We are also providing $2 million for Indigenous ranger programs and I am very pleased and proud of those. This is about Indigenous communities being empowered to assume control and train young people within their own areas. They are taking a tremendous lead. They should be commended and they should be supported.
       </p>
       <p>
        That, in turn, is aided by another $700,000 for protection against marine debris—in particular, the swirling death caused by ghost nets: nets that have been cut and cast adrift within the waters north of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
        </a>
        and the waters of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait
        </a>
        which flow into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Carpentaria" rel="nofollow">
         Gulf of Carpentaria
        </a>
        and the marine park. Another $600,000 all up, including $300,000 in new money, will assist with the work of the Cairns turtle hospital led by Jenny Gilbert and her team, many of whom are wonderful humane volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Against that background, I am delighted to thank all the parties who have supported this. I acknowledge the work of the shadow minister for the environment, who has been of assistance. I acknowledge the work of Senator Waters for the Greens. I particularly want to acknowledge he whom I would call the father of this legislation, Warren Entsch, within the House—and his 'partner in crime', Colin Riddell. Colin has been a campaigner on a mission and he has led us to this point. It has been one of the great joys of my work that we have been able to achieve this—but it will only matter if it is followed up with further action to ensure there is a real reduction in the take of dugong and turtle; that there is prosecution of those who breach the laws; and that there is agreement with traditional people so that we can ensure there is adequate protection in green zones.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are important steps forward. I want to thank all the parties involved and I am delighted to commend this legislation, which can be colloquially referred to as the dugong and turtle protection act, to the House.
