        in the State of Origin match, I rise to acknowledge the new student leaders within the schools of Fadden. Australia’s young leaders play an important role in setting a good example by acting responsibly and making positive choices. What is encouraging is that these leaders have been selected by their schools and in many instances by their peers for their potential to make a positive and lasting contribution to their school communities. We all know that Australia needs great leaders, and much more will be demanded of these leaders in their schools today and in their communities tomorrow.

I had an excellent opportunity to talk about how the House works whilst they sat in the student gallery watching question time as democracy played out on the floor. I commend the teachers of Steiner School and the students for the great work they are doing. I hope they enjoyed their time fully in Canberra, not just in
