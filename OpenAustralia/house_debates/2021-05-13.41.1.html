       <p>
        by leave—
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget places regional Australians at the heart of our national recovery post COVID-19. A strong and thriving regional Australia is good news for all Australians. This budget delivers for regional Australians in spades—certainly with shovels in the ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year's budget was the best budget regional Australia has ever seen. This year's budget builds on that record. Through this budget, our government is continuing to provide support as regional communities recover from a tumultuous period. This support is not just about immediate recovery; we are also working to help our regions prosper long into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional areas have been through it all in the past year and a half: drought, bushfires, floods and the health and economic impacts of a global pandemic. These events have challenged regional people, disrupted key regional industries and heaped great pressure on regional communities. Our people and industries have persevered against great adversity. As the Prime Minister said at Beef Week in Rockhampton just last week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the course of COVID, it has been our agriculture sectors, our resource sectors, our primary industries in this country that have done so much of the heavy lifting economically for our country and they've been going through hard times as well before the pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether it's the farmers in our agriculture industry who drove the value of agriculture in this country from $60 billion to $66 billion in the past year, or the tens of thousands of workers in the resources sector or, indeed, our small businesses, it is the regions leading our recovery. This is the spirit of regional Australia, the spirit this government celebrates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I deliver my annual ministerial statement to parliament on rural and regional budget outcomes. Last October, when I gave the first of these statements, I announced significant investment in our regions. This was a ground-breaking commitment to regional development, particularly providing much-needed support in the face of hardships and disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Today I update the House on the progress of these vital and timely efforts. I will also detail major new packages and individual measures we are delivering to support regional communities and industries in their recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I reaffirm the government's plan for strengthening our regions long into the future. This plan sees regional Australia as the ideal place to build a career, raise a family and launch a business—the place to lead a fulfilled life. The government's plan will help sustain strong regional communities, create jobs and grow regional industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year's budget was about delivering support for regional Australians when they needed it most and about realising their economic growth potential. Now look at the statistics. In 2020, 43,000 more Australians moved from the city to the regions than the other way around. It's helping address the sharply-rising demand for jobs in the regions—on the latest account, more than 66,000 vacancies. COVID-19 has posed significant threats, but the silver lining has been to show how the infrastructure and communications improvements of this era are delivering a new regional quality of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our regions are the place to be.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">
         McCormack
        </a>
        government, is bearing fruit. In last year's budget, we committed $4.6 million towards this campaign, because we believe that our regions remain some of the most vibrant, liveable and community-oriented places in Australia, if not the world—as I say again: big enough in which to find a great cup of coffee; small enough to still care.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March 2020, responding quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government established the $1 billion COVID-19 Relief and Recovery Fund. From regional tourism to regional airlines, from small business counselling to export marketing, this fund provides vital and targeted support to industries hardest hit by the pandemic, many of which are vital to regional communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Water is the lifeblood of our regional communities and industries. The 2021-22 budget has committed up to a further $258 million from the $3.5 billion National Water Grid Fund. As part of the $258 million, a new funding pathway within the fund, called the National Water Grid Connections pathway, will provide up to $160 million nationally over the next two years to drive the construction of smaller scale projects. Up to $20 million is available for each state and territory to deliver projects with an Australian government contribution of up to $5 million per project. An additional four new construction projects are being delivered to boost water security, build resilience in our regions, deliver jobs and grow our critical agricultural sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committing $75.7 million to the construction of new and augmented infrastructure projects. This includes an additional $7½ million in funding for Rookwood Weir to deliver water security in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        , bringing the total Australian investment in the Rookwood project to $183.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was inspiring, recently, to look out over the site. The excavators, 50 of them, were busy putting the footings down, which will ultimately result in a weir 200 metres wide and a spillway five storeys high. The site has a huge camp which will house up to 250 staff, project staff working 10 days on, four days off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rookwood Weir will mean a new era for agriculture, manufacturing, resources and communities, with 86,000 megalitres of storage. It will support jobs—more than 2,000 jobs for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . How good is that? We're building the new regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commitments that we are putting in place in water infrastructure build on eight construction projects already completed since our establishment of the National Water Grid Authority in late 2019, bringing the total number of construction projects in this investment pipeline to more than 30. Delivery of water infrastructure is happening:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These are just some of the projects already completed. But there's so much more to be done, and done it will be.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have committed a further $22.3 million towards the development of eight business cases, informing future investment decisions and the ongoing development of the National Water Grid. Each National Water Grid project means our regional areas are better serviced, more liveable and economically stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget further aids the COVID-19 regional recovery. We are providing more than $5.7 million in grant funding to the new Rebuilding Regional Communities Program, in partnership with the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal. We've announced an additional $1 billion for the highly successful, highly effective Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, delivering jobs and growth throughout regional council projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government continues to deliver proactive support for regional communities, from investing in the volunteer organisations to the big infrastructure projects. Duplication of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        , the $10.4 billion

        upgrade and essential works on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        are helping to bring us into a new era of road safety and efficiency. Road safety is a paramount objective. I've made this clear when I committed $2 billion over 18 months. Half of this money was for projects which are to be completed by the end of next month—around 700 projects approved, the majority in the regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget delivers an extra $1 billion for what becomes the $3 billion Road Safety Program, and that will save lives. The budget delivers an extra $1 billion, as I said. That is such a commitment, and our regional communities are very heartened by it. Everybody has been touched by someone they know who has had, unfortunately, a road trauma or a loss of life on our country roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        This, in turn, creates a jobs benefit, making sure that we've got that investment, with the new funding to support 4½ thousand jobs, taking total jobs around Australia supported by the Road Safety Program to 13½ thousand.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've committed $100 million over two years for Regional Recovery Partnerships. These partnerships are coordinating investments with all levels of government to support recovery and growth in 10 regions across the nation, delivering jobs and economic diversification. Already, we've had some fantastic regional projects announced through these partnerships. In Gippsland, a number of projects will boost the region's tourist economy, including the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Chester" rel="nofollow">
         Darren Chester
        </a>
        , will attest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was in Gladstone, where two projects are being funded, totalling $10 million. The first project will create a more accessible and attractive waterfront and upgrade Auckland Hill Lookout near Gladstone port for locals and tourists. The second project will help develop a hub of expertise in renewable hydrogen, exploring both domestic and export opportunities. The opportunity for innovation embedded in our regions will help secure our long-term economic and social future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aviation was hit first and hit hardest when COVID-19 came to our shores. The government stepped up to the challenge with targeted, sector-wide support to sustain the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March this year, we announced a further $1.2 billion package of support for the tourism and aviation sectors. This means industry-wide assistance from this government for aviation is more than $4½ billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a vital action for regional Australia to stay connected to critical services and networks in the face of COVID-19 challenges. Regional Airline Network Support, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANS" rel="nofollow">
         RANS
        </a>
        , has meant regional and most importantly remote communities have had face masks, respiratory equipment and, in particular, frontline health workers being able to come into their communities. Without RANS, regional communities faced being denied this vital support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The latest aviation and tourism package includes 800,000 half-price airfares to regions significantly impacted by the pandemic, with more than 663,000 already sold, encouraging a record number of Australians to enjoy a holiday at home this year—and why wouldn't you want to have a holiday in Australia and come to the regions? It's the best place in all of the world in which to have that break.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just this month, with Assistant Minister Kevin Hogan, I was pleased to unveil 46 more remote airstrip upgrades across far-flung areas of Queensland, the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the pandemic, the government stepped in when it mattered and provided the right kind of support where and when it was needed the most. As regional health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Coulton" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Coulton
        </a>
        , shows, this government has delivered fair access to COVID vaccines, equipment and medical personnel to all Australians, including our vulnerable remote communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government recognises our regions need and deserve high-quality health care. In this budget we've invested across services in primary health, hospitals, aged care, Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people's health, and mental health. We're investing more than $65 million from 1 January 2022 to boost bulk-billing rebates and provide more affordable health care for patients in regional, rural and remote areas. More doctors in the regions is our goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're looking to the future and showcasing regional talent. Our communities shine at their annual shows, and we all know that. The $39 million Supporting Agricultural Shows and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Days" rel="nofollow">
         Field Days
        </a>
        package is supporting these important industry and community events so they can not only survive but, indeed, so they can thrive into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, after the challenges of flood and COVID-19 disrupted their 2020 show, the Stroud Show north of Newcastle benefited from a grant, which was described by the show president as 'a game-changer'. A month before I visited in April, the showground was underwater, but this could not stop a determined show committee, so typical of the strength, resilience and dogged determination of regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government's continued investment in regional infrastructure creates jobs and fosters economic growth. Our enduring investment in transport infrastructure buoys our commitment to a record $110 billion over a rolling decade-long program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inland Rail will inject more than $18 billion into Australia's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        during construction and the first 50 years of operation. Many supplies for construction are sourced from Australian and specifically regional suppliers, including ballast and capping from Parkes, culverts from Tamworth, steel from Whyalla and concrete sleepers from Mittagong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        . Inland Rail is already helping to revitalise regional economies and attract new and expanded investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Building Better Regions Fund, the BBRF, is a monumental funding commitment to the regions. It backs community driven projects poised to deliver direct local benefit. It creates jobs. It drives economic growth, and it's just the right thing to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        As one example, Summerland Farm in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Rivers

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        received $4½ million to expand its macadamia processing and packaging facilities. This is supporting 200 local farms as well as employment opportunities for local people with disabilities.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingborough_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Kingborough Council
        </a>
        in Tasmania and Barkly Regional Council in the Northern Territory each have funding to build and to refurbish community facilities. BBRF funds projects which enhance community capacity and make regional Australia the best place in the world in which to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 2021-22 budget, this government commits a further $250 million—a quarter of a billion dollars—towards a sixth round of the BBRF. This brings the total commitment for the program to more than $1.2 billion over the seven years to 2024-25.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the world changes, as digital connectivity becomes increasingly central to economic and social life, we are supporting communities in regional Australia to keep pace with these changes. This budget gives a $153.2 million injection to improve connectivity in regional, rural and remote communities, further driving Australia's regional led recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will build on the success of the Regional Connectivity Program by committing a further $84.8 million to the program. This includes up to $24.6 million in extra funding for meritorious round 1 proposals which were unable to be supported from within the initial funding envelope. The remaining funding will be available through a new competitive grants process. This will support new projects additional to the 81 successful projects I announced last month with colleagues Ministers Paul Fletcher and Coulton. The government is also providing $68½ million in dedicated funding to improve telecommunications infrastructure across northern Australia through the Regional Connectivity Program and the Mobile Black Spot Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past 18 months, many regions have faced droughts, fires and floods. A new national resilience and recovery agency will continue to provide ongoing recovery support for individuals and communities. The new agency consolidates and builds on the success of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, the rural financial counselling programs from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Water and the Environment and the disaster risk reduction and recovery functions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        . It will use a network of on-the-ground advisers and coordinators who will work with partners and communicate with decision-makers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agriculture, drought and emergency management minister David Littleproud is delivering much-needed drought support programs for regional areas. I thank him for that and for his ongoing commitment to improve the lives and lots of people who live in our country areas. In 2020-21 we began the rollout of the $5 billion Future Drought Fund, a continuous funding source for drought resilience initiatives. The next phase, from 1 July 2021, includes $36½ million towards harnessing innovation, $91 million for better risk management to help farmers plan ahead and $12 million for better and more accessible climate information.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has extended the Drought Community Support Initiative and will provide assistance to farming households in financial stress in 117 local government areas, until the funding is exhausted. From 1 May 2021 this includes all local government areas announced as eligible for the Drought Communities Program Extension in 2020. We have funded eight drought resilience adoption and innovation hubs Australia-wide, collaborating with regional universities and the private sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have regional Australians' backs. The agriculture 2030 package supports Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors working to achieve $100 billion in farmgate output by 2030. An array of specific actions includes funding of $160 million to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        agricultural supply chain improvements project to better connect our world-class farmers—the best in all of the globe—to domestic and international markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through strong representation from resources, water and northern Australia minister Keith Pitt, the government has committed $190 million to the next five-year plan for northern Australia—
        <i>
         Our north, our future
        </i>
        . The next five years will pilot focused investment in geographic growth areas, deliver greater digital connectivity, support businesses to scale up and diversify, and will gather data to support evidence-based economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business growth is a key to the future. Indeed, the regions will continue to take full advantage of the instant asset write-off provisions now extended into 2023. Go and buy a ute. Go and buy that header. Go and buy all those capital equipment expenditure items that you now want to improve your productivity.
       </p>

        Last year we announced $41 million to support the regionalisation of Australian businesses, in line with the trend of more Australians making a tree and sea change.
       </p>
       <p>
        We remain focused on delivering these two programs, with announcements of projects to be funded expected in July.
       </p>
       <p>
        With strong advocacy from decentralisation minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gee" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Gee
        </a>
        , we are continuing to support the regional decentralisation agenda through new actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        An independent study will identify the regulatory barriers to business relocation to regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will have a particular focus on regulations across all tiers of government restricting, delaying or increasing the cost of business relocation to regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government will also complete a scoping study on establishing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Public Service
        </a>
        hubs in regional Australia. The study will inform consideration by the government of the feasibility, costs and benefits of the regional hubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will continue to work closely with our veterans Australia-wide.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Minister Chester says, Australians value the ongoing commitments of our veteran community, and the government is committed to providing support that recognised the significant contribution veterans and their families make in civilian life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government invests more than $11.5 billion each year to support 325,000 veterans and their families, many of them in the regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2021-22 budget builds on this with an additional $702.6 million to focus on wellness, support, suicide prevention and ensuring that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        is appropriately equipped.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent years the government has invested $500 million into the most significant reform of Australia's veteran support system in decades, which has achieved ongoing success in making it easier for veterans and their families to engage with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2021-22 budget includes a further $55.1 million to build on these improvements, making it quicker and easier for veterans and their families to absolutely get that support they need, as I say.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will continue to encourage the contribution to Australian society by our wonderful volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, Assistant Minister Michelle Landry recently advised closure of applications for the latest Volunteer Grants round.
       </p>
       <p>
        Combined funding from 2020-21 and 2021-22 has made this a double grant round.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know smaller-scale grants such as these deliver large-scale strength to our communities, through our community champions.
       </p>
       <p>
        We couldn't do without our volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The policies and programs I mention today are just part of the government's commitment to regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our commitment will facilitate recovery from the hard times but equally it is about looking forward—making sure regional communities are places in which Australians enjoy the good life.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is supporting regional Australians, building opportunities and investing in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our budget announcements, across all areas of regional life—infrastructure and transport, health, digital connectivity and supporting local business and leaders—are meeting the needs of regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2021-22 budget ensures regional Australia continues its recovery and has every opportunity to thrive in the future.

         I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the opportunity to speak on the importance of Australia's regions and the contribution regional Australians have made and are making to our communities, to society and to the nation's economy. Since the beginning of COVID-19, we've seen something remarkable happening in our regions. Our communities have effectively suppressed the virus. Agriculture, mining and a whole range of different regional industries have underpinned the nation's economy. We've seen innovations in renewable energy, in manufacturing and in tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite making up only a third of our population, regional Australians continue to punch above their weight in accounting for half of the national growth over the past decade. During the pandemic, many of us have enjoyed the opportunity to base ourselves in our home towns for the duration and have discovered that working from home and connecting with people around Australia and the world is entirely possible, though, for many, it would be nice to have a more reliable

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite our political differences, highlighted just yesterday on infrastructure, the Deputy Prime Minister and I both recognise the beauty and the special sense of community that comes from living in regional Australia. The quality of life in regional Australia has begun to break through into the national consciousness. There are lists of the best regional towns to move to, and friends in the cities are looking seriously at a regional move. This is a welcome change from what is too often a very narrow cast view of regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course this success is not without its challenges, few more so than rising house prices. High house prices used to be the exclusive domain of the major cities, but not anymore. It's great that lots of people have discovered how wonderful life can be in the regions, and we welcome them. They will surely become fierce ambassadors for our way of life. But we can't ignore what this has meant for first home buyers and low-income earners trying to get their first home or trying to find affordable rental accommodation in our regional cities and regional towns. It is a social problem for families and individuals, and it is an economic problem for our businesses. Businesses are reporting not being able to open for late meals and not being able to open at certain times of the day because they simply cannot find staff who can afford to live in their area to be able to operate. The government could have done something about this in Tuesday night's budget, but they haven't. The measures towards housing in fact exacerbate the problem, and especially exacerbate the problems in our regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia's regional policy today is still stuck in the tired frame of political expediency, one-off grant programs and 'one size fits all'. I welcome the Deputy Prime Minister's announcements of additional funding for local councils and for road safety, both vital for the health and wellbeing of regional Australians. I was very pleased to see, buried a little bit in the budget papers but there for those of us who looked through the regional statement, the announcement to look into the feasibility of one of the ideas Labor has been pushing and talking about for a while now: the development of Public Service hubs in our regions. It would also be great for the government to restore the thousands of Public Service jobs they've cut from the regional towns and communities across this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also need to acknowledge the 21 new or topped-up slush funds outlined in the budget. There is $4 billion just sitting there, ready to be thrown at coalition-held or target seats. It is this approach that continues to underpin the Morrison government's approach to regions, where some regions do well and other regions are completely left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as topping up slush funds, the government's budget introduced infrastructure cuts of $3.3 billion over the next four years. They tried to hide it, but it is on page 84 of Budget Paper No. 1. That is $3.3 billion less for regional roads, for trains, for bridges, for tunnels and, more importantly, for jobs in regional communities. The Deputy Prime Minister told the House yesterday that there were no cuts, that the $3.3 billion less is because the government pays on delivery. It was refreshing to hear the Deputy Prime Minister acknowledge, even if by accident, that they've not been delivering for regional Australians—not delivering to the tune of $3.3 billion over the next four years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fifty-five per cent of the Deputy Prime Minister's newly announced infrastructure spend is not even in the budget. Instead, it's off into the never-never somewhere beyond the forward estimates. For Victoria, 87 per cent of promised new funding wasn't in the budget. For Tasmania, it was 30 per cent. For
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , it was 43 per cent. For the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , we heard in question time yesterday that, incredibly, 99 per cent of the new funding apparently announced on Monday was not included in the budget. These broken promises leave regional Australians driving on worn-out roads, leave regional businesses dealing with degraded infrastructure and reduce the quality of life for Australians in our regional cities, towns and rural communities right the way across the country. It is symptomatic of a government that is all about the photo op and never there for the follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
         In few places is this government failure as stark as in northern Australia. As we all know,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         ers are saddled with soaring insurance premiums. Despite promising, with much fanfare, a $10 billion re-insurance pool, the budget papers reveal that the Morrison government has only allocated $2.4 million to establish a task force to begin consultation on a re-insurance pool, which will not even start until 1 July 2022. It's a $10 billion pool promised but only a $2.4 million taskforce delivered—eventually. North Queenslanders need help, not a plan for a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         And, while we're on North Queensland, we can't move on without reference again to the infamous NAIF. The 'no actual infrastructure fund', as it's widely become known. The government promised to spend $5 billion in five years supporting northern Australia infrastructure projects, turbocharging the economies in our north. It might have created a flashy headline or two, but in reality, over five years—remember that it promised $5 billion to be spent out the door into northern Australia in five years—it has only managed to spend just six per cent of the fund. Just last week, the government took the extraordinary step of using its NAIF powers to actually block a $380 million renewable energy project in North Queensland that would have employed 250 people. That was 250 good, long-term, secure jobs in regional Australia in North Queensland that this government deliberately blocked. Labor will always back energy workers in North Queensland and the households and the businesses that want lower bills, not play politics with regional jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government also announced a new agency to replace the National Bushfire Recovery Agency months ago in response to the bushfire royal commission. The reannouncement of a new disaster resilience agency is yet more marketing from a government that has promised a lot on natural disasters but just has simply not delivered. Bushfire and flood victims who are still waiting to see money hit the ground will wait to see how committed to natural disaster recovery this government really is. Many people are still being forced to live in caravans and temporary accommodation years after the event has occurred. After all, this government still hasn't delivered a cent of the disaster funding it promised two years ago in the 2019 budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a similar story on water infrastructure, too. A promise of 100 dams turned out to be a mirage. There was the promise of an independent, statutory water grid authority. Well, it's neither independent nor statutory and we're not sure yet whether it is in fact an actual national water grid or whether it is a National Party seat water grid.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor Party do have a very proud record when it comes to our regions. Our party was born in the regions and it is our party that built the regions. Every government formed by our party has taken steps to advance the regions. Back in 1942, well before Australia returned to peace, it was the Curtin government that understood that the regions were the place to drive postwar recovery.

         , in the 1970s, saw the regions as a place to confront entrenched social and economic inequality. The Hawke years saw the potential of Geelong, Newcastle, Mackay, Townsville, Bunbury, Launceston and Hobart, and we invested and built them into the wonderful, vibrant cities with strong local economies that they are today. The last Labor government, under the leadership of

         , both in their regional ministerial capacities, sparked regional growth by building connections between regions and the cities. We are proud to have established and funded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Regional Australia
         </a>
         Institute, and I'm grateful that the Deputy Prime Minister has continued to support this important initiative. We established Regional Development Australia across the country to drive economic growth and to improve liveability in each region.
        </p>
        <p>
         If we are to have a recovery truly worthy of the name then our regions have to be part of it—not just some regions but all of them. A responsible, responsive government would engage with local communities, listen to local leaders and work hard to find out what investments they need, what regulations can be changed and how we can build self-sustaining industries that grow out of a region's pre-existing strengths. That's because good leadership involves understanding that not all regions are the same and, in our own home towns or in Canberra, we cannot hope to understand all of them. The people who know best what a region needs are the people who live in that region. The local councils, the chambers of commerce, small-business owners and community leaders—all of them have ideas about and insights into what their communities need to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor understand this. That is why, under the Leader of the Opposition, we are not looking to decentralise; we're looking for smart regionalisation. Smart regionalisation means having a comprehensive understanding of each region's strengths and job growth potential and playing to those strengths. For Cairns and Gippsland that might mean tourism investments; for Shepparton, high-level food processing; and for Wollongong, hydrogen and renewable energy. It can mean investing in resources, renewable energy, health care, the service economy and exclusive tourism experiences of fine wine and food. It means investing where we can create the highest number of good, secure jobs, using the base of our existing industries to do so—harnessing those existing strengths and turning them into lasting engines of growth for our regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor's national rail manufacturing plan is a good example of this. Designed to leverage government investment in rail infrastructure, the huge amounts of money that we invest in spending on rail will be used to grow secure manufacturing jobs and to build more trains here in this country. This would mean more jobs and investment in regional communities such as Maryborough in Queensland, Newcastle and my hometown of Ballarat.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lifting people out of poverty and improving living conditions are what we in the Labor Party are all about. With this in mind, we know that the current climate crisis we face is also Australia's jobs opportunity. That's why we have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and why we have announced our policy to rewire the nation. This is a $20 billion commitment to modernise the electricity grid and to help facilitate the uptake of renewable energy across the nation. We have also announced Labor's 'Power to the people' policy, which will connect up to 100,000 solar homes to shared battery storage, reducing costs and emissions, creating jobs and helping to deliver new opportunities to our regions. Tonight our leader, Anthony Albanese, may have more to say about renewable energy jobs and harnessing the potential of young people in our regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said earlier, we know that housing is an increasing challenge for more and more Australians, and our regions are no different. Despite the trillion dollars of debt the Morrison government presented on Tuesday night, not a single cent was invested in social and affordable housing in our regions. An Albanese Labor government will develop and implement a national housing and homelessness plan that will help more Australians to buy a home. It will help Australians who rent and will help to put a roof over the heads of more homeless Australians. If you want to hear more about it, tune in tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
         When Australian governments invest in Australian jobs it is often the regions that benefit first. Regional Australia does need a plan. It needs a plan that identifies what investments are needed, where they are needed and when they are needed. It needs a plan that identifies how we leverage infrastructure investments to grow local businesses and to grow local jobs. It needs a plan that treats all regions fairly, not one that prioritises those that vote for the coalition or the National Party. It needs a plan that looks at the long term, not just the next election cycle. An Albanese Labor government will develop and implement such a plan—a plan to ensure that our regions get their fair share; that they grow sustainably; that we address the challenges of rising house prices; and that we capitalise on the huge job opportunities from tackling climate change. An Albanese Labor government will work for the regions, not take them for granted.
