                   My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister’s attention been drawn to recent reactions to evidence given at the Cole inquiry? What is the government’s reaction?

                    I say to the member for Fairfax that there has been a lot of reaction to evidence given before the Cole inquiry, but one reaction that came from a

                    politician with the Christian name Kim; it came from none other than the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,

                    , in the Western Australian Labor government—bearing in mind that he is agriculture minister in the largest wheat-exporting state of Australia. I think what he had to say is a piece of very good advice to everybody on both sides of the House. I will read what he had to say:

                   <p>

                   <p class="italic">
                    but let’s wait until we hear from the Cole inquiry about what the situation really is rather than commenting on bits and pieces of evidence as they fall out of the inquiry.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The reality is that the level of investigation and the measure of transparency displayed by the Australian government is greater than that of any government in the world. This government has subjected itself to an inquiry that no other government, according to my advice, has been willing to do. We have had these indignant comments from the Leader of the Opposition and from the member for Griffith that Cole cannot investigate these matters. That is wrong. It is wrong with a capital W.

                      In other words, Cole is looking at the behaviour of DFAT. Is any other government around the world doing that? No. Cole is looking at the role of DFAT. But let me go on.

                                        yesterday, I have been advised that, having searched the files, DFAT has no record of any knowledge of the complicated arrangements to inflate wheat contract prices to enable the repayment of the Tigris debt and wheat compensation payments. I am advised that it was aware in 1995 that
                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">

                                        had funded a shipment of

                                        wheat as a humanitarian donation. However, when BHP and AWB proposed that the donation be repaid under a credit agreement, DFAT advised this would violate sanctions. DFAT also emphasised that any changes to the original

                                        agreement would require sanctions committee approval. This fact has been reported to the Cole inquiry—the point that we continue to make to the Leader of the Opposition. DFAT’s advice was clear and consistent with the UN sanctions regime, and DFAT has no record or any knowledge that the Tigris, BHP, AWB deal actually went ahead.
