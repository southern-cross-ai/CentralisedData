        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        is obviously a great reform, but, just as obviously, too many people trying to access the scheme are hitting a bureaucratic brick wall. For example, there's a long wait to get an NDIS planner and there are problems staying in touch with the planner once you get one and difficulties understanding the finished plan. Moreover, reasonable requests are too often denied. And it's especially telling that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        is spending $10 million a year on legal battles to try and stop people getting funding—fights it's often losing. Prime Minister, what will you do to fix the NDIS?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is absolutely committed to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         . It is one of the most important social and economic reforms in our nation's history. It is changing lives and changing lives for the better. On Friday I was with the member for Robertson, where in that electorate around 2,900 people are expected to benefit from the NDIS. We were delighted to see together, firsthand, with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Premier, the work of participants at Fairhaven and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Clare" rel="nofollow">
          Point Clare
         </a>
         . We met with Alexander Coppleman and the team at the Options Disability Theatre—really inspiring people—and they are benefitting from the NDIS. They represent some of the 162,000 Australians who are now accessing the NDIS, where a majority of people are receiving more support and obviously have greater choice and control. Eighty-four per cent of participants who entered the NDIS in the March quarter rated their experience as good or very good, and today the NDIS has released its quarterly report that shows that 44,945 people who had not been getting services from any government are now receiving support from the NDIS. These are people who have significant and permanent disability but were left without any assistance in the community. To demonstrate our commitment to the NDIS, we have sought to guarantee this essential service and give people certainty: the certainty that it will now be funded into the future, as the Treasurer outlined in the budget; and certainty through the landmark bilateral agreement with New South Wales, which I signed with the Premier last week, that will deliver long-term funding and support for the NDIS in that state.
        </p>
        <p>
         The level of support provided in a participant's plan is based on what's determined 'reasonable and necessary' under the act. As of 31 December 2017, the total number of

            , in response to feedback from participants and providers that their experience was not meeting the high standards expected, undertook the pathways review. In response to that review, the agency has been developing and trialling a new model which includes more face-to-face planning to ensure people are listened to and, as a result, receive better quality plans and a more consistent point of contact as well as clearer communication to participants. The authority and the government are committed to ensuring that the
