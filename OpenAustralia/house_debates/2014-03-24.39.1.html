       <p>
        In my electorate, it is vital that the government does not delay the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I am concerned by recent media reports that, again, this issue is on the agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope that the federal government will not use the review into the National Disability Insurance Scheme to postpone or delay the rollout. Bendigo was listed next as one of the places for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        to roll out. In my electorate, that would help 3,400 local people with a disability to get extra support and to have more choice over how they receive that support. Currently, the system of disability care is totally broken. It would be an absolute disaster for people in my electorate if the NDIS was delayed and not rolled out.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Friday, I will learn firsthand how the disability insurance scheme will help people in my community as I take part in 'walk a day in my Shoes' with professionals working in this sector from Radius Enterprises. From previously speaking to them, and from speaking to community organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Continuing Education
        </a>
        and Amicus, I know how important it is that the NDIS is rolled out and rolled out soon. These organisations are ready to partner, our community is ready and families are ready. It is so important that the government does not delay the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is important that we get on with job of making it happen.
