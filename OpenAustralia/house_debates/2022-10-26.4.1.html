        (2) calls on the Government to support the passage of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Ransomware Action Plan) Bill 2022, which would help law enforcement disrupt and deter cyber-criminals who engage in ransomware and cyber-extortion activities targeting Australians and Australian businesses.

       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has signed Australia up to the Global
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane" rel="nofollow">
         Methane
        </a>
        Pledge despite promising the Australian public that it would not sign the pledge during the 2022 election;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) this is a broken election promise;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Global Methane Pledge includes a target to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent on 2020 levels by 2030;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) 48 per cent of Australia's annual methane emissions come from the agricultural sector, where no affordable, practical and large-scale way exists to reduce it other than culling herd sizes;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) in the previous Government, the Coalition invested over $18 million to monitor and reduce fugitive methane emissions in the energy and resources sector, and help farmers reduce emissions from livestock; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) this pledge, in effect, creates a cap on the size of Australia's livestock industry;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) international research shows the target cannot be realised without taking behavioural and technical measures in the livestock agriculture sector, and recommends people change their diets resulting in lower meat and dairy consumption, leading to a capping or reduction of the national livestock herd;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) this will increase the price of a steak at your favourite restaurant or butcher, or a white coffee at your favourite cafe, at a time when small businesses are already struggling with mounting cost-of-doing-business pressures; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) this pledge equally calls to reduce methane emissions from the gas sectorâ€”a critical fuel source that complements the increasing share of renewables in our electricity gridâ€”which adds pressure to production and generation and is an invitation for the type of chaos we are seeing in Europe at the moment; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) install financial protections for Australia's agricultural sector which will be impacted by the Global Methane Pledge;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) provide assurances to Australia's agricultural sector that there will be no new taxes and regulation to deliver the Government's methane emissions reduction target;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) provide assurances the national livestock herd will not be capped or reduced as a consequence of the Government's methane emissions reduction target.

       <p class="italic">
        (a) Israel, as a sovereign state, is free to decide its own capital; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) for the last 3,000 years Jerusalem has not been the capital of any state other than a Jewish state, and has been the seat of government of Israel since 1950;

       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that the territory of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        (a) has been part of Israel's sovereign territory since the state was established in 1948, and is not part of the territory which Israel captured during the 1967 war;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) is therefore outside the scope of

        (3) further notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia's recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2018 did not in any way pre-empt the outcome of peace negotiations, or undermine the prospects of achieving a peaceful settlement of the conflict based on the UN-endorsed principle of two states for two peoples; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) since 2020 five Arab states have officially normalised relations with Israel, thereby disproving claims which were made in 2018 that recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital would worsen the conflict; and

        (4) calls on the Government to:

        (i) the Australian people for the lack of consultation or opportunity for public debate in the lead-up to the decision, and for effecting an important change of government policy through an amendment to a government website, and then officially denying the change, before a decision was taken by the Cabinet;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Israel for this ill-considered decision, and the hasty and careless manner in which it was made; and

        METHANE: Resumption of debate on the motion of Mr Hamiltonâ€”That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has signed Australia up to the Global Methane Pledge despite promising the Australian public that it would not sign the pledge during the 2022 election;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) this is a broken election promise;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Global Methane Pledge includes a target to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent on 2020 levels by 2030;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) 48 per cent of Australia's annual methane emissions come from the agricultural sector, where no affordable, practical and large-scale way exists to reduce it other than culling herd sizes;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) in the previous Government, the Coalition invested over $18 million to monitor and reduce fugitive methane emissions in the energy and resources sector, and help farmers reduce emissions from livestock; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) this pledge, in effect, creates a cap on the size of Australia's livestock industry;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) international research shows the target cannot be realised without taking behavioural and technical measures in the livestock agriculture sector, and recommends people change their diets resulting in lower meat and dairy consumption, leading to a capping or reduction of the national livestock herd;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) this will increase the price of a steak at your favourite restaurant or butcher, or a white coffee at your favourite cafe, at a time when small businesses are already struggling with mounting cost-of-doing-business pressures; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) this pledge equally calls to reduce methane emissions from the gas sectorâ€”a critical fuel source that complements the increasing share of renewables in our electricity gridâ€”which adds pressure to production and generation and is an invitation for the type of chaos we are seeing in Europe at the moment; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) install financial protections for Australia's agricultural sector which will be impacted by the Global Methane Pledge;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) provide assurances to Australia's agricultural sector that there will be no new taxes and regulation to deliver the Government's methane emissions reduction target;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) provide assurances the national livestock herd will not be capped or reduced as a consequence of the Government's methane emissions reduction target.
