        I rise to speak about a breakthrough that will directly help some of the most vulnerable people in my local community. Last week I was very pleased to welcome the Attorney-General,

         Central Coast
        </a>
        domestic violence unit. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV" rel="nofollow">
         DV
        </a>
        unit is operated by Legal Aid New South Wales and will bring together legal and support services in one place, delivering a greater level of support to those in urgent need. It partners with local providers to deliver services such as crisis accommodation, mental health support, financial counselling and other practical support that can be so important in helping those people escape violent relationships and situations. It's one of six new domestic violence units being established across Australia, with funding of $3.4 million from the coalition government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twelve existing units across the country have already helped more than 4,000 clients in the past couple of years. This service is based in Gosford, but it will spread help across the region. For instance, dedicated lawyers who understand the effects of trauma will attend apprehended domestic violence order list days at Wyong local court each weak. They'll be offering immediate free help for domestic violence victims and providing intensive case work for clients facing legal issues, including divorce, child abduction and financial abuse. Beyond the courtroom, a dedicated social worker will support vulnerable clients who have experienced domestic and family violence such as by helping women and children keep a roof over their heads, contacting Centrelink on their behalf or connecting them with counsellors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been urging the government to look closely at the Central Coast because of our shocking rates of domestic violence, with around 1,600 cases or more in the 12 months from last year, according to the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. But I believe that this domestic violence unit will be even more effective, because of the way it's already been working in partnership with existing organisations and services in our community. You only needed to see that more than 100 people attended the unit at the launch last week to see these people on the front line. They include the local police force, who do an extraordinary job;

        Special mention of course goes to legal aid for the work that they were already doing; to Brendan Thomas, Kylie Beckhouse, Susannah O'Reilly; Sophie Tarr; Gabrielle Cantrall; Melanie Alexander; Maria Le-Breton; Melissa Hollands; and the rest of their team, who work so tirelessly with victims of domestic violence on the front line every day. Thank you for undertaking this important work.
