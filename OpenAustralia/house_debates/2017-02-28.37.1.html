        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does government policy agree with the member for Chisholm, who told

         Again, we will not take members opposite as reliable stenographers for the statements from the government members. But the reality is that the honourable member opposite would well know that those five Labor appointees on the Fair Work Commission, every single one, were appointed by a Labor government—four by his leader, the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition. They were all appointed by the Labor Party, and the president, Mr Ross, spent his life working for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
          ACTU
         </a>
         . The reference was delivered to them by the Labor Party. He heard thousands of pages of evidence, hundreds of witnesses and came to the conclusion that a reduction in Sunday penalty rates of the levels proposed would increase employment. That was the considered decision of the Fair Work Commission, and we accept that decision. We support the decision of the independent umpire because it is their decision.

           You either support the independent umpire or you do not. We support the independent umpire and we support the independent umpire whether it is the courts or whether it is the Fair Work Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
           What the Labor Party is doing is endeavouring to walk away from a commitment over many years, many decades to supporting the independent umpire's decision. That decision is one that was carefully considered. And honourable members opposite need to look at what they have done in practice in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBA" rel="nofollow">
            EBA
           </a>
           after EBA around the nation. In fact, I understand from Mr Strong, the chief executive of COSBOA, that 80 per cent of retail workers in Australia on shop distributive and allied trades awards are working on Sundays at penalty rates lower than those set by the Fair Work Commission. That is the fact.

             , if it is good enough for them, why are those opposite condemning the decision of the independent umpire, the members of which they appointed, the decisions of which they said they would support? They appointed it, they established it, they claim they support independent umpires in industrial matters and now they are walking away from it, undermining, as
