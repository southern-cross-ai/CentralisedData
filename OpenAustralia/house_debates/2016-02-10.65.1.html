        My question is to the Treasurer. The government promised before the last election not to make any adverse changes to superannuation, but, according to reports today, the government wants to do a deal with the Greens on superannuation that would see millions of middle-income Australians paying more tax and retiring with less. Is the Treasurer so lacking in ideas, other than increasing the

        </a>
        , that he is getting his ideas from the Greens party?

           I had the opportunity to receive a copy a little later, and we are having a discussion, when it comes, about these matters of tax. I welcome contributions from people all round the country, as the Prime Minister does, about what can be done to make our tax system growth friendly. What I do not hear in this debate too often—except from those on this side of the House—is ideas about how we can reduce tax, about how we can reduce the tax burden on people who are earning every day and paying income tax on those earnings or on companies who are earning every day and paying tax on the earnings. I hear plenty of suggestions about how extra money should be spent. I hear plenty of suggestions about how taxes should be raised and how those taxes should be spent. But only those on this side of the House have been seriously considering ideas and suggestions about how you can actually ease and reduce the burden on Australians who are earning in our economy, because it is the Australians who are earning in our economy and it is the small businesses who are earning in our economy that generate the revenue to pay for our welfare system. It is true that around eight out of 10 income tax payers go to work every day in this country to pay for our welfare system.
