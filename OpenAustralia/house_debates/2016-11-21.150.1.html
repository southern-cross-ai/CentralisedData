       <p>
        I rise today to talk about meningococcal disease. This is a disease that has recently affected my communities of the Riverland and the south-east.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease" rel="nofollow">
         Meningococcal disease
        </a>
        is an acute bacterial infection that can cause death within hours if not recognised and treated accordingly. In Australia, there are five main strains of the disease, all of which now have vaccinations. Since the C vaccine was introduced in 2014, the most common strain of the disease in Australia is now the B strain. Given the quick progression of the disease, early action and treatment is vital. But diagnosis can sometimes be challenging because the symptoms mirror those of influenza.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the nature of the disease, there is a strong community push for inclusion of the vaccine for the B strain to be added to the National Immunisation Program. Under the National Health Act, the government cannot include the new vaccine on the NIP, or the National Immunisation Program, unless it has first been recommended by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBAC" rel="nofollow">
         PBAC
        </a>
        is an independent expert advisory committee comprising doctors, other health professionals and consumer representatives. The process of PBAC considering products for listing on the PBS or NIP is evidence based, and so it should be. It considers each listing submission having regard to the safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the medicine or vaccine for its intended use. The same evaluation requirements are applied in all cases to ensure consistency and fairness in the listing process.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government cannot interfere with the listing process. It is not for politicians to determine which vaccines will be included in the program or which medicine is on the PBS; it is for the medical experts. The PBAC considered Bexsero, the meningococcal B vaccine, for inclusion in the NIP in November 2013, July 2014 and July 2015. On all occasions, the PBAC has rejected the submission on the basis of cost-effectiveness and clinical uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand the concerns of the community on this question. As a father of two young children, I get their fears. They can be terrifying. That is not withstanding that the rates of meningococcal, particularly for the B strain, in this country are in decline. So I am calling on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline" rel="nofollow">
         GlaxoSmithKline
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSK" rel="nofollow">
         GSK
        </a>
        , the manufacturer of Bexsero, to make a further submission to the PBAC and to work on the cost-effectiveness in that submission so that young people in Australia can get access to the vaccine, free of charge, in the same way that young people living in the United Kingdom can. I trust that this further application will be made. I am standing firm with my community, who are concerned about this issue.
