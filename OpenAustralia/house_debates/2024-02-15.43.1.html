       <p>
        I rise today to commemorate the life of a remarkable woman,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Willis" rel="nofollow">
         Betty Willis
        </a>
        , who, sadly, passed away this week. Betty joined the Ryde District Historical Society in the late 1990s and her work with them continued for over two decades. She served as secretary and president. Her knowledge of late 20th century Ryde was unparalleled. If ever there was a question about the history of our district, Betty held the answer. Her memory was a treasure trove of information and she always freely shared it with kindness and warmth.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my role as councillor and mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         City of Ryde
        </a>
        , I was lucky enough to have the opportunity of working alongside Betty countless times in committees, meetings, events and projects. Her involvement as a committee member on the City of Ryde's Centenary of Anzac and Commemoration of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        Committee was invaluable and something that her friends and her family should be very proud of. Her knowledge and advice helped the council install new memorials and appropriately commemorate the centenary of World War I. Before Betty's involvement, Anzac Park in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         West Ryde
        </a>
        did not have an Anzac memorial, and now it does. Anzac Park's annual 9 am family Anzac Day ceremony exists because of the contributions of Betty Willis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Betty is survived by her husband of over 60 years, Michael; her children, Libby and Matthew; and her five grandchildren. Betty, thank you for your dedication to our community. We are much better because of your service. Vale.
