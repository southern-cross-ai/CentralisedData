        They are at it again.

        and Nationals are out there, scaring Australians and making stuff up rather than explaining why they're now supporting Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts. What they don't want to talk about is that this government is giving every Australian a tax cutâ€”everyone, not just some. Given that they're not talking about it, I thought I would use this time here today to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Bennelong alone 92,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut, and 81 per cent of taxpayers in Bennelong will see a larger tax cut than from the Morrison plan. We've done this because our communities have asked us to. Locals wanted tax relief to be better. Locals needed more cost-of-living relief, and locals want a government that isn't afraid to make the tough decisions. There was Annette, who wrote to me to tell me that 'revising the tax cuts in light of changed conditions is brave and necessary'. Then James reached out to tell me, 'As an average-income family with a child, I really appreciate what the Labor government is doing right now with tax.' So tomorrow I'll go back to these people to tell them that they have a local member who is part of a government that's ready to listen to them, because I proudly represent a community that wants a government that will make the hard decisions for the right reasons at the right times. With Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts, we've done just that.
