       <p>
        Honourable members may be aware that last week I celebrated my 21st birthday, the first 21st in federal parliament. I want to take the opportunity in this place to thank my family, friends, the countless locals in my community and my parliamentary colleagues for their kind wishes, gifts, cards and the many celebrations I have enjoyed. I have been humbled by and grateful for the many thoughtful and kind gestures people have made. I want to particularly thank those I do not spend as much time with as I would likeâ€”and perhaps I should. Family and friends are so important and I am truly grateful for the warmth, love and support they continue to show me.
       </p>

        In my electorate I had a spectacular handmade and decorated cake delivered to my office by Debra Casey, who is in the process of establishing a business whereby all children, but particularly those with a disability, can decorate cakes to improve their fine motor skills. The enthusiastic schoolchildren at Banksia Beach State School dressed up in hats and had decorated the school with streamers and balloons when I attended their school for Walk to School Safely Day. Students at

        sang me happy birthday at their Cultural Infusion day I opened on 20 May, an event aimed at developing a greater understanding of Aboriginal and Islander culture at the school. I thanked them for the birthday cake they surprised me with. I have been overwhelmed by the number of emails, cards and phone calls I have received from the community of Longman. It has been a further reminder of what a great community it is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this opportunity to thank my parliamentary colleagues for their birthday wishes and for the celebration that was organised for me. I thank the Leader of the Opposition,

        </a>
        for their kind words and for their support since I was elected to parliament. I thank my parliamentary colleagues, their staff and parliamentary staff and countless others who have made my transition to parliamentary life as easy as possible. It is only in the

        that we can see a 21st in the parliament. Whilst the Labor Party talks about progressive achievements we get on with actually delivering them, based on a commitment to Liberal values and philosophy. We have seen that in this parliament with the election of

        . All of us sitting on the coalition benches were elected supporting the Liberal philosophy of fair reward for hard work, of supporting the individual in their enterprise and of a hand up over a handout.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an honour for me to serve in this place and I will continue to work hard to represent my electorate and to justify the faith that has been shown in me by my constituents and by my colleagues.
