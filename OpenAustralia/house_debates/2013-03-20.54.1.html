        I rise to acknowledge a remarkable young constituent from my electorate, Caitlin Kirby. Caitlin suffers from Down syndrome. However, despite her disability, she is a very talented swimmer. Caitlin has been swimming for many years, beginning competitive swimming at the age of eight for the Wilston Crocodiles, where she still competes today. Caitlin also swims for her school, Mount Alvernia College, as well as the secondary school championships, competing at a state level for the last seven years.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the inaugural National Down Syndrome Swimming Championships at Noosa in September 2011, Caitlin won three events, establishing three Australian records, as well as winning a bronze medal. Caitlin was then selected in the Australian Down syndrome swimming team and competed in the 6th World Down Syndrome Swimming Championships at Loano, Italy, in November last year. She picked up four gold and three silver medals for her country.
       </p>

        Catlin received a local sporting champion grant to assist her with this trip, and I was absolutely delighted to present the certificate to her at the Brisbane Inner North Sporting Community breakfast last Friday, where she showed off the swag of medals that she has won. Everybody in the room was absolutely impressed with her presentation. Everyone was impressed with her wonderful achievement representing her country. The Brisbane electorate is so very proud of you, Caitlin, and as a local member I would like to echo that.
