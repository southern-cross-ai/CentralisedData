       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to a number of fantastic people in my electorate of Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        who were recognised on the 2019
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        list. These locals have come from broad backgrounds and their contributions have helped to shape the Central Coast to be what it is today: the very best region in the very best country in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Denise Lawrence from Macmasters Beach is one such person, recognised for her contribution to music. Since first picking up a cello 70 years ago, Denise has had a distinguished career as a performer, examiner and teacher. At 14, she successfully auditioned to become a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Youth_Orchestra" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Youth Orchestra
        </a>
        and a student at the Australian Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. After building her career as a soloist and orchestral player in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , Denise returned to Australia and pioneered the concept of teaching instruments in group settings with her late husband, Bruce. This is something that has been continued in almost every school around the country today. It's wonderful to see Denise's contribution to musical education acknowledged with a Queen's Birthday Honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another worthy recipient from my electorate is Dr Michael Scobie. Dr Scobie is a renowned ophthalmologist, having work for years to restore sight to people in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        . He began volunteering in 1988 in the North Queensland Aboriginal Eye Care program, where he worked for five years returning sight to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        . In 1996, he set up Central Coast Eyecare in Gosford. At this time, Dr Scobie began travelling to Papua New Guinea, which he continued to do regularly for 17 years. His work has changed the lives of thousands of people, and I commend him on his contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Patsy Edwards, another recipient of a Queen's Birthday Honour, has served the veterans' community of the Central Coast for almost two decades. I have had the very great pleasure of knowing Patsy for a number of years now. As an active member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        for the past 42 years—and I note that she is still on the stand-by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Army Reserve
        </a>
        list—Patsy is a most deserving recipient of this award. As the daughter of a returned serviceman, she has always been passionate about the welfare of veterans and their families. Patsy took her passion and became one of the first female members of Legacy in Hobart. In 2000, Patsy became a member of the Gosford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch, going on to serve as secretary of the sub-branch for the last 18 years. She has volunteered countless hours of her time organising services on Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        , as well as a number of other commemorative services across my electorate. It really is an award that is well-deserved by a person who has made an enormous contribution to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge our Chris Holstein for his tireless service to the Central Coast. Chris received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for his services to local government in the community of Gosford. I've known him for many years. He's been serving the Central Coast for many years, beginning as a councillor in 1991. In 2011, he became the state member for Gosford and served until 2015. His contribution to public life was not yet over, and he returned to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        and serves as the deputy mayor to this day. He has continually fought to make the Central Coast the great region that it is today, and there are a number of projects and a number of important community groups on the Central Coast that owe Chris Holstein a great debt of thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brenda Booth has also been acknowledged for her contributions to stroke advocacy and stroke survivors. Aged just 41, she suffered from a stroke. After her experience, she has passionately worked to improve stroke care as a member of the Stroke Foundation's Consumer Council, as well as the foundation's Research Advisory Committee as a sole stroke survivor. Locally in my electorate, Brenda is the co-president of the Working Aged Group Stroke, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAGS" rel="nofollow">
         WAGS
        </a>
        , on the Central Coast. Her commitment to improving care for stroke survivors was recognised last year when she was named the Stroke Foundation's 2018
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Volunteer of the Year
        </a>
        . I really want to thank Brenda for all of her important work in raising awareness and supporting other stroke survivors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I pay tribute to residents from the northern end of the Central Coast, as their efforts have benefited all of us across our region: Karin McGann for her service to the community through Lions Club Australia; Donald John van Keimpema for service to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        ; and former Central Coast local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Morris" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Morris
        </a>
        , who received an Australia Medal for service to wildlife conservation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are lucky to have so many outstanding individuals on the Central Coast. They truly do reflect the fabric of our community, and I thank them for all they do.
