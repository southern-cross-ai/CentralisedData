        I rise today to speak about my electorate’s favourite son—in fact, he is one of Australia’s favourite sons—the outstanding athlete

        , and about his decision last week to retire from professional sport. His five Olympic gold medals and current world records in the 200-metre and 400-metre freestyle and four by 200 metre freestyle relay, as well as numerous other Commonwealth and Olympic records, hold Ian Thorpe as one of our and, indeed, one of the world’s best ever swimmers in the history of the sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from Ian Thorpe being one of the country’s most prolific sports achievers, he is also renowned for his humility both in and out of the pool. It is admirable to see the way in which he has managed his achievements to the benefit of others. It is these great qualities that make him an icon for younger Australians striving for the chance to one day exhibit the greatness that he has achieved. The work he has done with his charity, the Fountain for Youth, has enabled money to be raised in areas of Indigenous health and education and for the

        of Australia and a number of other very worthy causes both in Australia and abroad.
       </p>
       <p>
        I join with the nation in their disappointment about Thorpie’s retirement; however, I also commend him for his courage to follow his feelings, despite national pressure for him to continue swimming. On behalf of my electorate and all Australians, I thank him for the inspiration he has instilled in millions of us. I wish him all the best for the future, no matter what it holds for Ian Thorpe.
