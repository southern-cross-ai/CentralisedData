        I rise today to congratulate the citizens of Barton for their combined community support during the past 19 months. Importantly, I would like to record that COVID vaccination rates in Barton continue to rise. As of last Monday, 87 per cent of all eligible Barton residents had had their first dose and 80.9 per cent of eligible residents had had their second dose, an increase of 3.1 per cent from last week. Well done to Barton. We are blessed in Barton with the many community organisations that have been working tirelessly since the start of COVID in March last year to assist their clients. At a recent Zoom meeting, we shared their lockdown experiences of keeping clients engaged, caring for mental health and generally keeping people supplied with daily necessities. Sunny Field Disability Services, 3Bridges Community and Bayside Anglican Church spoke about how they were delivering in-home care to many of their clients, as well as online programs focused on their clients' mental wellbeing. The local Scouts have collected masks and sent them out to Wilcannia, and the Kingsgrove

        are in constant touch with their veterans and widows. The Kogarah Storehouse and Meals on Wheels advised that their food distribution programs were running well despite lockdown restrictions. Settlement Services International spoke about how they'd been working to inform clients in their own languages about the importance of being vaccinated. All organisations commented on how their workers and helpers had also been caring for each other. To each of these wonderful workers, who are mainly volunteers, I say thank you for a job well done and for continuing to support the people of Barton.

        I'd like to give a shout-out to all Barton students, from kindergarten to university, for managing for most of this year with online lessons, along with other people across the country. I particularly want to recognise the year 12 students and the teachers. St George and Bexley chambers of commerce sadly reported that some small businesses had gone out of business, and we hope this situation will improve. I cannot finish without saying thank you to all the dedicated essential workers in Barton, especially those at St George hospitalâ€”doctors, nurses, everyone working in the health sector. We owe you so much for your continuing care in our community. Well done to Barton for your great community spirit during these difficult times, and a special thank-you to the community organisations.
