        My question is to the Prime Minister and it relates to the 106 house fires that have been linked to his disastrous home insulation scheme. I draw the Prime Minister’s attention to comments yesterday from the head of the fire investigation unit within the Victorian fire brigade, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a ticking time bomb, and the only way we’ll defuse it is … to get … up in the ceiling space, check everything’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        and is safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given this direct warning, will the Prime Minister finally commit to inspecting all of the 1.1 million homes that are at risk as a result of his disastrous home insulation scheme?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Concerning the causes of specific fires to which the honourable member refers, it is important that individual investigations are left to be concluded. Furthermore, I say in relation to the honourable member’s question that I am advised that the current rate of fire concerning insulation in houses is about one in 10,000 homes. I would also say to the honourable member in response to his question that, prior to this program commencing, there were some 80 to 85 fires which arose from 60,000 to 70,000 homes being retrofitted with insulation in the previous year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The honourable member goes to the question of the inspections regime. I draw his attention to the fact that, when it comes to all houses which have been installed with foil insulation, all of those homes will be inspected. I will also draw the honourable member’s attention to the fact that the government will undertake all inspections that are necessary—

           Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.

           <p>
            In terms of non-foil insulation, I advise the honourable member that the government thus far has committed to 150,000 inspections. I say in response to the honourable member’s question that, based on inspections to date, 92 per cent of those that have been concluded have had no safety issue related to them. I would also say to the honourable member what we said at the beginning of this matter—namely, that the government will undertake all home inspections that are necessary. We say to members of the public who are concerned about these matters: contact the government through the appropriate numbers, which have been indicated in earlier statements by the minister.
