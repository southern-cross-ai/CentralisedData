        A few days prior to Christmas last year, Jacqui Meyers of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        in my electorate dropped in to exchange festive season cards with me. Whilst there she asked me to speak in parliament about the work of Kurrajong Waratah, her employer, which is something I am more than happy to do. Jacqui is great. After the centenary of Anzac commemorations concluded in Wagga Wagga, she went up to the wreath-laden cenotaph and saluted. It was a poignant and memorable moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kurrajong Waratah's vision is to support people with a disability, such as Jacqui, to lead a life of their choice. It is a marvellous community-run not-for-profit organisation providing services to more than 600 babies, children and adults with disabilities right throughout the Riverina region. In operation for more than half a century, Kurrajong Waratah services are varied and cover early intervention, supported and open employment, vocational training, supported accommodation, independent living, and day and retirement programs. Kurrajong's community education program helps draw public attention to the needs and aspirations of people of all ages who have disabilities, and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the ways this is achieved is through an annual fundraising race day at the Murrumbidgee Turf Club in Wagga Wagga, which we held this Saturday. This race day has been held for 27 years and is a tremendous family event. The Kurrajong Waratah Race Day committee has funded therapist positions for babies and children, provided equipment and resources, purchased motor vehicles and, more recently, supported the construction of group homes and the development of a lifestyle facility for adults who are ageing.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        Kurrajong Waratah is a wonderful organisation, and it does a great job of assisting many local people with disabilities to live the lives they want to and to reach their full potential. Congratulations and good luck with the race day this Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another fund raising event for Kurrajong is its annual Art Union, which has been going for 35 years, and which provides up to $90,000 to the organisation's many and varied tremendous charitable services. Kurrajong's recycling services and, importantly, the e-recycling facility, are providing jobs and environmental outcomes, not just for Wagga Wagga but for the wider region—so valued and so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some amazing people helping to run Kurrajong Waratah—Steve Jacques,

        , Cathie Smith, and many, many more. Cathie's son, Danny, has utilised Kurrajong services. He had a recent setback with some surgery, but thankfully he is back doing what he loves doing—smiling and helping out with the Wagga Tigers Australian Football and Netball Club. Cathie is always quick to praise the remarkable, overwhelming and ongoing support from the community that Kurrajong rightly and justifiably receives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I very much look forward to the National Disability Insurance Scheme operating right across the country. It is good public policy. That is why I was the first
