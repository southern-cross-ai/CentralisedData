        Base Infrastructure Works Project under the Base Security Improvement Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Security at Defence sites remains a high priority for the government and for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        . Defence continues to review and improve its protective security arrangements to ensure that its most valuable assets—people—remain safe and able to conduct their important role. The $203.502 million base infrastructure works project is part of the wider Defence Base Security Improvement Program. It proposes to deliver a range of infrastructure enhancements to 16 sites.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project is part of Defence's response to the government's 2009 review of the Defence protective security arrangements. These enhancements have been designed specifically to reduce the risk to Defence personnel of the possibility of terrorist attack. The protective measures include the provision of alert and surveillance systems, electronic access control and detection systems, improved command, monitoring and management facilities, as well as enhanced entrance and reception facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The infrastructure solutions delivered by this project have been developed in conjunction with a range of other protective security improvements which are being implemented across the entire Defence estate in Australia. These include changes to legislation and policy, procedural improvements and the introduction of armed response capabilities at some sites, plus other minor infrastructure works. Defence is working closely with local planning authorities as well as the relevant road and traffic authorities to ensure that any disruptions during construction are minimised.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to begin in early 2013 and is planned to be completed by mid-2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.

        The Moorebank Units Relocation project proposes to relocate 13 Defence units and associated Defence facilities, the largest of which is the Army School of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Engineering" rel="nofollow">
         Military Engineering
        </a>
        , from the Commonwealth owned but currently Defence occupied site for the future intermodal terminal at Moorebank to neighbouring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Holsworthy Barracks
        </a>
        in New South Wales. In addition to the provision of facilities for the relocated units, several facilities are also to be provided to enable the relocation and to achieve an efficient consolidated-facility solution at Holsworthy Barracks when considered over the whole of life. The enabling facilities include a new mess, a physical fitness complex, a chapel and facilities for elements of the 5th Brigade currently located at Holsworthy. In addition the project will improve the functionality and capability of Holsworthy Barracks by replacing a substantial amount of inadequate and non-compliant infrastructure and engineering services well past their design and economic life to meet the needs of the new facilities to be delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will provide new working, instructional and living-in facilities for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Military_Engineering" rel="nofollow">
         School of Military Engineering
        </a>
        , other relocated Defence units and aligned organisations. The project will also upgrade security and access arrangements at the northern entry to Holsworthy Barracks, including a new intersection on Heathcote Road approximately 500 metres east of the current intersection configuration. This will address traffic congestion in the existing location by separating Holsworthy Barracks from the Holsworthy railway station and residential access.
       </p>
       <p>
        Redundant facilities beyond their economic life in the vicinity of the proposed new works will be demolished and realise operational savings. This capital investment in the project will have economic benefits for the Sydney region and local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposed work is $870 million plus

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHA" rel="nofollow">
         DHA
        </a>
        purchased this land from the private market via a private treaty in late 2011. The site was selected due to its close proximity to established shopping and service facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouse_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Parramatta CBD.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal will involve development of the site over two stages, with stage 1 consisting of general civil and road works for the development of 65 serviced allotments and stage 2 consisting of the construction of 34 dwellings for Defence personnel use in the form of 26 integrated town houses and eight detached dwellings. The estimated overall project cost is $21.85 million, including GST and excluding the cost of the land. The cost of the land will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and lease-back program.
       </p>

        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, civil construction is expected to commence in April 2013 with dwelling construction to be completed by December 2014. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.
