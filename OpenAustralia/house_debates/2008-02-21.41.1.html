        My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer’s warm endorsement of state governments’ financial management generally and their business enterprises in particular, and his assertion that their borrowings were being incurred to ‘invest in capital projects, not to fund recurrent outlays’. I also refer to the fact that over the last three years the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Labor government has ripped out of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Water" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as tax and dividends 91 per cent of its entire profit before tax. Given the urgent need to invest in water infrastructure, does the Treasurer seriously contend that the management of Australia’s largest water utility as a cash cow is a model of sound financial management?

         I thank the member for his question. The member is continuing with this assertion that somehow the borrowings of state government business enterprises are having an impact on inflation and therefore let them off the hook when it comes to seven interest rate rises in the last three years. Well, they are not going to get off the hook when it comes to their responsibility for high inflation—the highest elevated inflation in 16 years; seven interest rate rises in three years. It is absolutely essential that state governments invest in critical economic infrastructure—critical economic infrastructure such as water; critical economic infrastructure such as transport and ports. The previous government was simply—

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a very specific question about whether
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Water" rel="nofollow">
           Sydney Water
          </a>
          was borrowing money to pay a dividend to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

          government rather than spending the money on infrastructure and whether the Treasurer agreed with it—a simple question. I draw attention to relevance.

          <p>
           Drawing on precedence, as I have been invited to do on other occasions, I believe that the Treasurer has been relevant, whether he is specific or not.
