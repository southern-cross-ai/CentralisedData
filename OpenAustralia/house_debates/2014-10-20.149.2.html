        I want to take his opportunity to remember and pay tribute to Ray Lees, a dear friend, who died Wednesday 15 October aged 85. He was a man of great integrity, decency, energy and community spirit who played a significant role in shaping the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Cockburn" rel="nofollow">
         City of Cockburn
        </a>
        , the largest local government in my electorate; and who throughout his life dedicated considerable energy to public service and the interests of working men and women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ray was born and bred in Fremantle. He left school at 14 and worked delivering ice by horse and cart before joining a Norwegian supply ship in 1943 to support Allied troops when he was only 15. After the war he worked on the waterfront in Fremantle and was an active member of the Waterside Workers Union throughout his 42 years on the wharf. He was a proud Labor member and there would be literally a dozen state and federal parliamentarians, myself included, who had the benefit of Ray's advice and local campaigning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ray Lees began his incredible contribution to local government in 1972 when he was elected to the council of what was then Cockburn Shire. He remained a representative of the South Ward for 30 years—and in that time was never opposed. Over that period, Cockburn grew from a shire into a town and then into a city—it is now one of the fastest growing outer metropolitan areas in Australia. It was entirely appropriate that when Cockburn became a city it did so under the excellent guidance and stewardship of Mayor Ray Lees.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the local federal member, I have been grateful to Ray many times since my election for his knowledge and good counsel about all things Cockburn. It has been my privilege to work closely with Ray's successors in the City of Cockburn to help achieve the provision of important community infrastructure like the new integrated health facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockburn_Central" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coogee_Surf_Life_Saving_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Coogee Surf Life Saving Club
        </a>
        in Coogee. And considering Ray's important work in establishing both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coogee" rel="nofollow">
         South Coogee
        </a>
        and Jandakot bush fire brigades, and his membership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        bush fire board, I know he very much welcomed the creation of a new fire and emergency service headquarters in Jandakot, funded by the former Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the current Mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Howlett" rel="nofollow">
         Logan Howlett
        </a>
        , his fellow council members and city staff feel a great deal of gratitude and affection for Ray Lees. I know that Ray's contribution to his municipality through three decades of service is widely recognised and valued by the community he served with such heart and hard work and dignity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ray Lees was named a Freeman of the City of Cockburn in 1997. In 2005 he was made a life member of the WA branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In speaking today of Ray I also want to speak of Rose, his wife and best friend of 60 years, who died in 2006. Rose of course had a share in every achievement of Ray's. She was his partner in all their endeavours, from market gardening to good governance, and especially in shaping their wonderful family—their children, Glenda and Alan, their partners, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our condolences and best wishes are with the Lees family as they remember and celebrate the remarkable life of Poppy Ray. We love Ray, we miss him and he will live in our hearts.
