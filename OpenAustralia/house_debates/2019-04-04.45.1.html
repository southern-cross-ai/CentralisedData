        I stand here against this antiworker government and their agenda. As the member for Moreton said previously, him and I sat with a couple members of the metalworkers' union recently and heard about this Esso dispute. For more than 652 days—in fact, 652 days, 12 hours and 31 minutes—these workers have been on a picket line.

This is an antiworker government standing by, letting labour hire rip apart the wages and income of working people in this country and ripping apart families. This is unacceptable—652 days for these Esso workers! Guess what their parent company,
