        and Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary. Around 25,000 visitors from around the country and the world come each year to see the majestic beauty of the ranges, which change with each season. For some time now a public debate has been ongoing about mining exploration within the ranges and the possibility of a large-scale uranium mine being developed within the 600 square-kilometre Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue came to a head when last year mining company
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Marathon Resources
        </a>
        had its 90 square-kilometre exploration licence within the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary renewed for another year by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government. Marathon Resources had its drilling licence suspended in February 2008 when it was claimed that the company had improperly dumped mine cuttings in the sanctuary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marathon has already drilled around 120 holes in the area and I understand now intends to drill a further 10 holes up to 500 metres deep. The area is believed to contain very large deposits of uranium and it has been reported that Marathon Resources has already spent about $25 million on the Arkaroola project. Arkaroola was established as a private national park in 1967 by oil and gas pioneer Dr Reg Sprigg in order to preserve its environmental, cultural and heritage values. I understand his work and his vision has been continued by his children Doug and Marg who now manage the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary. Marg Sprigg was recently quoted in Adelaide’s
        <i>

          Sunday Mail
         </a>
        </i>
        as saying about Arkaroola:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is an area that should be preserved for its rare wildlife, it’s extra ordinary landscape and for eco-tourism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Renowned landscape photographer Stavros Pippos in the same article described Arkaroola as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A geological museum of global significance with unique animal and plant life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I doubt that anyone who has visited the sanctuary would disagree with those descriptions. The mining industry argue that mining is compatible with preserving Arkaroola as an ecotourism location. The industry also argues that hundreds of jobs will be created and billions of dollars of net economic benefit to South Australia will be generated. It is a claim disputed by many, including South Australian Tourism Industry Council Chief Executive Ward Tilbrook who, in the same
        <i>
         Sunday Mail
        </i>
        newspaper article, is quoted as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any mining activity in the award winning Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary will damage the positioning and realisation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        as a legitimate world class nature based eco tourism destination. The impact of mining activity will damage a spectacular and unique wilderness sanctuary.
       </p>
       <p>
        As has been pointed out by others, mining revenue is finite. On the contrary, tourism income will be ongoing. The track record of some mining industries does not leave me with the confidence that mining is compatible with preserving the unique environmental characteristics of Arkaroola. An additional concern is the millions of litres of water that will be required for mining operations. That water would have to be pumped out of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Artesian_Basin" rel="nofollow">
         Great Artesian Basin
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        With calls growing for Arkaroola to be listed as a National Heritage site and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        site the South Australian government will ultimately have to decide on whether mining rights are granted to Marathon Resources and, if so, under what conditions. Future global demand for uranium is likely to drive the price of uranium higher and the pressure on the state government to approve mining will be even greater. It will be a difficult decision for the state government, which I understand is carefully considering all the issues and presently consulting with the community on a conservation plan for Arkaroola.
       </p>
       <p>
        I await with interest any state government decision on the future of the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary. I have contacted the federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities seeking advice as to whether any provisions of the Environment Protection Biodiversity and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Conservation Act
        </a>
        apply with respect to any of the mining approval processes relating to Arkaroola. I believe Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary should be listed as a National Heritage site. Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary is too precious to risk. There are many uranium deposits in the world, but there is only one Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary. Because of its uniqueness, I believe Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary should even be a World Heritage listed site. Selling our uranium is one thing; selling our heritage is another. As Margaret Visciglio, vice president of the Field Geology Club of South Australia, said about mining in Arkaroola:
