        2018 Commonwealth Games Queen's Baton Relay as it passed through four towns in my electorate. It was an exciting couple of days, with the baton relay visiting Albany, Denmark, Manjimup and Bridgetown. There were some 50 outstanding people chosen to carry the baton, all of whom have done extraordinary things in their community.

        , to pick one of them, has been an active member of the Manjimup community for over 30 years and a great friend and supporter of mine. Pat is a justice of the peace who is involved in a huge number of community organisations, including the Manjimup Cherry Harmony Festival, the Manjimup Chamber of Commerce and the Windmills project, which supports and mentors people with disabilities.

He's the founding member of Manjimup Vegetable Exporter Growers, an innovative concept of packing and exporting local produce from Manjimup.

        The 2017 Bridgetown-Greenbushes Citizen of the Year, Leonie Eastcott, was the final baton bearer in Bridgetown.
