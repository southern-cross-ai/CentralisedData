       <p>
        I am very pleased today to raise in parliament the significant works on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Mall" rel="nofollow">
         Empire Mall
        </a>
        in Mornington. The mall is currently undergoing $600,000 of upgrades funded by the Turnbull coalition government that were secured during the recent election. Mornington is a vibrant, small-business-focused suburb in Dunkley, and I am thrilled that the much-needed renovations on the mall have commenced.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday, 24 July I visited Empire Mall and spoke to local traders who will benefit from the changes. The works are highly encouraged by both traders and the community, as once they are completed the mall will be a beautiful asset to Mornington. The improvements will ensure a safer social space for children and a more user-friendly space for locals, as well as celebrating our rich local history. The modifications include improving pedestrian access; restoring the memorial fountain, including moving it back to Mornington Park, its original location; extending the natural shaded areas by introducing canopy trees and additional planting; and enhancing the existing landscape, walls, paving and visual amenity. The project runs from July to October. It is being done in seven stages to minimise impact and disruption to traders. As well, it is being run by a local company called Maw Civil.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mornington has been a tourism and economic hub for many years. I look forward to seeing this project completed in October to complement the already family-friendly spaces and to celebrate our rich local history.
