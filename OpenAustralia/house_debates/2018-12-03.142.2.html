        Best wishes to all of the community organisations and the Rotary clubs that do so much on the ground, who work for, support and commit their services to our wonderful community, whether it's at the local farmers markets, the local Bunnings or wherever it is they do their good work. When you do what you do, it has an impact. It binds our community together. It's part of the social fabric. We're so proud of everything that you do. That's why you'll continue to have my support, and you're part of the reason I'm so proud to represent a community as wonderful as ours.
