        I would like to draw the attention of the House to a pressing issue in my electorate: public transport infrastructure and the fact that the residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Springs
        </a>
        are still crying out for a train station. Back in 2008 Sir Ron Eddington proposed an extension of rail services to Caroline Springs. His
        <i>
         Investing in Transport
        </i>
        report found strong population growth in the west was driving substantial changes across the entire city. The report found Melbourne needed better east-west transport connections to address core congestion problems, to meet rapidly increasing travel demand, to support a growing population and to keep pace with the changes taking place in the city's economic and urban structure. The
        <i>
         Investing in Transport
        </i>
        report also cited data forecasting growth in Melbourne's west by 34.4 per cent between 2006 and 2030. In Melton the population is set to grow by 205 per cent up to 161,000 by 2031.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent ABS data shows the population of Caroline Springs has grown by 395 per cent since 2001. Mindful of this burgeoning growth, the former state Labor government pledged to build a train station to service Caroline Springs' 23,000 residents—and it put the money where its mouth was, providing $38 million as part of a $189 million package in the 2010-11 budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Preliminary work for Caroline Springs train station began in 2010. Had the work continued, the station would have opened last year. Of course, the work did not continue and, instead, we have a road to nowhere. The Victorian state government, when they came to power in 2010, shelved plans for the station despite the funding allocation that had already been made. I keenly remember how shocked and disappointed local residents were to learn of this news—and they are still angry. Indeed, I was stunned to learn of the news myself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Late last year the transport minister, Mr Mulder, could only offer this comment: 'Caroline Springs station design work has been completed. The coalition government is now considering building the station.' Well, the time for consideration has long since passed. The facts are in. The city of Melton experienced the fifth greatest rate of growth in the entire country between 2011 and 2012. We know the benefits that come with public transport. For users, there is less congestion, shorter commuter times, reduced stress levels, less time spent on the road and more time spent with friends and families. Vehicle cost savings, parking cost savings and increased safety and health and energy conservation are just some of the efficiency benefits. I call upon the Victorian government to address this issue and ensure that the Caroline Springs community have a train station as soon as possible.
