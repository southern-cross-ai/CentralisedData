       <p>
        I rise to share with the House information about and details of a wonderful group that exists throughout Australia, the Partners of Veterans Association. It was formed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in 1999 in the Shortland electorate. There are two wonderful women who have been involved right from the outset, Narelle Bromhead and Lesley Minner. It became a national organisation in May 2003. They celebrated their 10-year anniversary on 31 August last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have created a network of state branches, sub-branches and support groups. They offer guidance, information, friendship and support to partners of veterans.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Partners" rel="nofollow">
         The Partners
        </a>
        of Veterans Association, as I have already mentioned, originated in New South Wales. As interest was generated across Australia,  more of the states set up branches, including Queensland,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Victoria. Their membership continues to steadily increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the main aims of the Partners of Veterans Association is to offer support at all levels to both current and former partners of veterans, including war widows and families of veterans. This group has been very effective at doing that. They work as mentors if one of their members has a problem. They are all there for each other. They aim to improve the quality of life and health and wellbeing of all partners, war widows and separated or divorced partners and their families. It is not gender specific. They support partners of veterans from all conflicts and peacekeeping operations and any other hazardous service from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        through to Iraq and Afghanistan. The association is for partners, and they address their issues positively within the veterans community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have arranged appointments for people from this group to meet with ministers from the previous government and with the current Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. They are fierce advocates. They get in there and fight for their members to make sure that they get a good deal. They have been able to bring about change and make improvements in the lives of their members, the partners of veterans. They are a fantastic organisation and fantastic women. I would recommend that any member who has the opportunity to meet with them do so.
