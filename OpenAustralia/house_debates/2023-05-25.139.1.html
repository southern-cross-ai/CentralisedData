       <p>
        Recently I had the pleasure of visiting the Blair Athol North Primary School in my electorate for the official opening of their rain garden. It was a great occasion. A smoking ceremony took place. There was a fire pit in the rain garden and a display of the students' works. There was coffee made by their student baristas, and some amazing samples of Indigenous foods were shared. I've just got to say, what a terrific occasion it was, and I want to give a big shout-out to the people in attendance: Councillor Carol Martin; the chief executor of the Department of Education, Martin Westwell; the governing council; and the many parents who were there in attendance. Another big shout-out goes to Alice Paraskevas, the Aboriginal education teacher, and of course the principal, Darren Stevenson.
       </p>
       <p>
        They recently had another occasion to commemorate—their Reconciliation Week celebration—and combined their reconciliation action plan launch with the official opening of the Aboriginal learning studio. I apologised to them for not being able to attend due to committee meetings in Brisbane that day, but I was represented by staff from my office, and I will be visiting to see the new Aboriginal learning studio.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so impressed with the principal, the teachers and all the staff at Blair Athol North Primary School, who work tirelessly to lead and guide the children to fulfil their best abilities and who teach them about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people's culture, languages, heritage and history and the significance that First Nations people hold in our nation. And I'm always extremely impressed by the children. Every student showed their respect, and did so wholeheartedly. You can see the children's eagerness to contribute, to learn and to grow, and that is truly inspiring.
       </p>
       <p>
        The children of Australia need all of us to look out for them, to look out for their future on this beautiful earth and to make sure that we are role models as they're growing up. I am proud that the education and skills funding to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        is estimated to be around $2.3 billion in 2023-24, and I'm proud that I've already been able to deliver funding for many of my schools through grants across Adelaide as part of our election commitments, such as Richmond Primary and Challa Gardens Primary.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'll take this moment to thank not only the teachers at Blair Athol North Primary School, as well as the principals and the parents, but also teachers right across Australia, for fostering the generations to come. I also thank the children at Blair Athol North for hosting me, and all the children in my electorate and across Australia, and I ask them to keep on dreaming, to keep being curious. I wish them all a great year for the rest of the 2023 school year.
