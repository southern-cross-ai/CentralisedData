        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on recent developments in Kosovo?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Calwell for that question. Yesterday the government of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence for the nation-state of Kosovo. This unilateral declaration of independence followed a long period of negotiation between Kosovo and Serbia, largely under the auspices of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMIK" rel="nofollow">
          UNMIK
         </a>
         . As members would appreciate, this long period of negotiation has not been successful. There has been no agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. I think it is true to say that there will not be unanimous community welcoming of yesterday’s unilateral declaration of independence, and that was reflected in the debate in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         yesterday. Having said that, Australia very strongly supports recognition of Kosovo’s independence. We believe that that is the best way forward for peace and stability not only in Kosovo but also in south-eastern Europe. The Australian government urges the relevant leaders—Prime Minister Thaci of Kosovo and President Tadic of Serbia—to ensure that whatever disagreements there are between Serbia and Kosovo, whether on the unilateral declaration of independence or on other matters, they are resolved peacefully and in a way which does not incite violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government also urges this view upon relevant parts of the Australian community. We know that attitudes towards the independence of Kosovo are strongly held in sections of the Australian community, and whatever views are expressed should be expressed by way of restraint so as to ensure that all persons’ views in this matter are respected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government’s approach to recognition is that the Australian government recognises nation-states, not governments. The criteria for the recognition of nation-states are that we find a permanent population, a defined territory, a capacity for effective government and a capacity to have relations with other nation-states. We believe that these criteria are met in the case of Kosovo; and, as a consequence, we are very favourably disposed to recognition of Kosovo. We are currently in discussions with our allies, partners and friends about our approach, and after these discussions we look forward to formal recognition of Kosovo at an early opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think one of the very key priorities for Kosovo into the future is to ensure the rights and the safety of minorities in Kosovo, including and in particular the protection of cultural and heritage sites. We have seen in Kosovo and in south-eastern Europe in the last decade or so a very sorry history. Australia played its part with the warm and generous welcoming of Kosovar refugees to our shores a few years ago. The Australian government very strongly believes that the best way forward for peace and stability in Kosovo and in south-eastern Europe is to recognise the independence of Kosovo under international supervision, and after appropriate discussion with allies, friends and other nation-states, we hope very quickly to move to such a formal recognition.
