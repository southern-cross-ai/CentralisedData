        , Environment and the Arts, I seek leave to make a statement on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 in discharge of the committee's requirement to provide an advisory report on the bill, and to present a copy of my statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts I make this statement, the content of which the committee has endorsed. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 was introduced in the House on 23 May 2012. The following day, following the recommendation of the Selection Committee, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts for consideration. The bill amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005.
       </p>
       <p>
        In presenting the bill, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, made some remarks about the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WELS" rel="nofollow">
         WELS
        </a>
        —scheme, which was established in 2006, and its objectives: to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for purchasers of water-use and water-savings products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water-use and water-savings technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further information on the scheme and the ways in which changes are proposed are outlined in more detail in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Many were canvassed by the minister in his second reading speech, and I do not propose to take up more of the House's time in repeating statements that have already been made. In short, the bill proposes amendments arising from an independent review of the scheme conducted in 2010 in accordance with the original legislation. The amendments concern matters relating to governance, compliance, administration and funding arrangements for the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his second reading speech, the minister noted that the scheme 'receives widespread support from the industries affected by it' and that, further, 'This bill has been developed taking into account extensive consultations with stakeholders as to the nature of the changes proposed.' As part of its inquiry, the committee received a private briefing from representatives of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities about the bill and its impacts. During the briefing the committee was made aware of the consultation process conducted by the department, and the committee notes that most of the submissions received are available on the department's website.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the uncontroversial nature of the bill and the level of stakeholder consultation that has taken place to date, the committee has determined that a more detailed level of inquiry is unnecessary. The committee therefore recommends that the House pass the bill.
