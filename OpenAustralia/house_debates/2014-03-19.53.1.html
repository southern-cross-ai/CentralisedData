        The Re-Engineering Australia Foundation is a fantastic, not-for-profit organisation which is unleashing in school students a passion and facility for engineering, science and maths. Today it was very energising to visit their school technology challenge in Canberra Exhibition Centre and to see the

        cars they have designed and built. Balga senior high school team is made up of young people from refugee backgrounds. I met members from Burma, Thailand and Vietnam. They said that their cultural diversity really powers them and unites them in a common goal. They have come to Canberra as a team with the goal of competing against the best and to make themselves, their school and their families proud. Indeed, they have done that.

        Wesley College is fielding two teamsâ€”the quantum racing team and the fusion team. Quantum have told me that they strive to do what some deem impossible. We endeavour to push the boundaries, to do what has never been done before, just as in the quantum world. I want to congratulate Doctor Michael Myers, the founder and chair, and all of the committed teachers who are ensuring that Australia will have a great economic future.
