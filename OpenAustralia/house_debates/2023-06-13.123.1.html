        I rise to proudly congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Mariners on their remarkable achievement in winning the 2023 A-League Men Grand Final. Described as a David-versus-Goliath match, their 6-1 victory against Melbourne City in the grand final was a testament to their exceptional skill and unwavering spirit to believe. In a season marked by challenges, the Mariners have captured the hearts of the entire coast with their first championship win in a decade.

        Lisarow local Jacob Farrell clearly made use of a 2016 local sporting champions grant provided through my office, securing two crucial penalties in the box, leading to a hat-trick by striker Jason Cummings. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Vanuatu" rel="nofollow">

        was there too, watching Vanuatu's first professional footballer, defender Brian Kaltak, the 'Brick Wall of Gosford', who played the biggest game of his career and won. It's a sign of a growing bond through sport between Australians and our Pacific neighbours. The match showcased the Mariners' dominance and determination. Their fast-paced performance, precision goals and solid defence left their Melburnian opponents stunned. The victory is inspirational, reminding us that, despite challenges, the coast can succeed.

        I'd now like to move on to recognising some of the hardworking community organisations in my electorate that received a recent volunteer grant. Provided with funding of $4,500 to improve maintenance at Adelaide Street Oval, the volunteer grant for Killarney Vale Bombers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        Club will mean the grounds remain a safe and welcoming place for players and spectators. Two marine rescue units received funding:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Head" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Tuggerah Lakes. These two units provide vital coastal emergency response services, keeping locals and visitors safe on our waterways and our oceans.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ourimbah Scouts have been granted $1,500 to support their volunteers. With a strong focus on fostering personal growth and community engagement, the Ourimbah Scouts continue to make a positive impact on the lives of young people on the coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recognising the invaluable contributions of their volunteers, We Care Connect has been awarded a grant of nearly $2,000. This funding allows We Care Connect to support their dedicated volunteers, who selflessly devote their time and energy rehoming quality preloved children's essentials with families who need them most.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding has been provided to Central Coast Doggie Dates to boost their social group providing an opportunity for dog owners to meet and socialise in a welcoming and supportive environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        These organisations showcase the diverse range of volunteer initiatives on the Central Coast. Through their dedication, they make the coast a resilient community and a supportive place to live. I'm proud to have been able to support their work through the 2023 volunteer grants.
