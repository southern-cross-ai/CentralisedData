        I would also like to acknowledge Lino and Shirley Pirlo, who for 27 years have owned and operated Pirlo's tyres in South Lismore. They bought the business in 1997 and it's a family affair. Their daughter Jo worked with Lino in the tyre shop, and as a true family business, Lino and Shirley's second daughter Debbie also joined the staff in 2006. Lino and Shirley have also been heavily involved in the community at the Italo club holding many board positions, running events and in the kitchen cooking pastas. Lino and Shirley recently sold Pirlo's tyres to another local family, Tony and Kelly Millard and their children Sophie, Matt and Brad will also be involved in the business. Lino and Shirley are also looking forward to spending more time with their family, Kylie, Jo, Peter, Debbie, Andrew, Fiona and Todd, and grandkids Hunter, Sienna, Tom, Gina, Amy, Tate and Ruby. Congratulations Lino and Shirley for the service you've done for our community, and I hope it's a retirement well earnt and well spent.
