        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the importance of maintaining public trust and confidence in our government's management of national security issues? Is the minister aware of other approaches that may have different outcomes?

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. It should be evident that the standing and legitimacy of democratic governments depend on the extent that its ministers can advance the national interest without fear or favour. The Turnbull government has single-mindedly advanced Australia's national interest, including through clear and consistent foreign policy.

           I contrast that with the Labor Party's approach and the examples we have seen in recent times where the Labor Party, at the behest of personal benefactors or foreign states, have changed longstanding foreign policy positions without explanation. Indeed, we have the infamous example of Senator Sam Dastyari—

             Mr Speaker, you gave a clear direction yesterday on members being referred to by their title. The Treasurer was the person you gave that warning to yesterday. He has just made the exact same comment, and he is trying to say that because it was not from the dispatch box he is somehow not within parliament.

All interjections are disorderly and I do not like them at all. They come from all parts of the chamber and, unfortunately, those interjections make it into

               I was referring to the example of Senator Sam Dastyari, who publicly contradicted both government and opposition longstanding foreign policy on the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
                South China Sea
               </a>
               at the behest of his personal benefactor.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have now learned that the member for Hunter, when Minister for Defence and a member of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
                National Security
               </a>
               Committee of a Labor government, had a personal benefactor whom it is alleged had close links with the Chinese intelligence service. That now brings to mind a very disturbing incident that occurred when Labor did a sudden about-face on an important foreign policy position and abruptly announced Australia's withdrawal from a quadrilateral security dialogue between Australia, the United States, Japan and India at the behest of China. It begs the question: what role did the member for Hunter play as a member of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                National Security Committee
               </a>
               and the Minister for Defence in that extraordinary about-face and backflip on the part of the Labor government with no explanation?
              </p>
              <p>
               It gets murkier, because earlier—I think it was last week—the Fairfax media put a series of questions to the member for Hunter, and in response he said unequivocally, 'I have never written to a Chinese official.' That is what he said. I would invite the member for Hunter to repeat that statement in this House, but then how would he explain his sworn affidavit to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
                ACT
               </a>
               Supreme Court where he lists letter after letter from him to various Chinese officials, members of the politburo, senior members of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Chinese Communist Party
               </a>
               , governors and vice- governors? What is it, Member for Hunter—no correspondence with Chinese officials or letter after letter? It is this kind of behaviour that destroys public confidence.
