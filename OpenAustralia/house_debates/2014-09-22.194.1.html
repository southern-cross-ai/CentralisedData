        As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, schools in Indi have strong communities that take pride in providing the best possible learning environment for their students. The environment of teaching, nurturing and, most importantly, caring produces wonderful, well-rounded students. One example is the Dederang Primary School in the scenic Kiewa Valley. I want to thank the Dederang Primary School for inviting me to the fantastic fundraiser on Tuesday, 9 September. Congratulations on hosting the dinner. The drama of the storm could not outshine a terrific community event, the outstanding food and the wonderful company.

        It was a privilege to sit with five students from Mount Beauty Secondary College, who were studying politics. We had a great conversation about politics in the world and I came away with a few good tips. Primary school students Angus McKillop and Bailey Jones gave me a rundown of the school family photo board, and Aidan Kirley and Ila Bowditch made excellent speeches. It was a pleasure also to chat with parents and teachers and it gave me a wonderful sense of how important that school is to the Dederang community. I would like to finish by congratulating principal Bronwen Martin, who did an excellent job, welfare worker Rachel Cosgriff, who did great work, Di Goonan and all the board and the community. You run a terrific school.
