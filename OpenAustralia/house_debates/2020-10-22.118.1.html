        Experts say that the pink butterfly doesn't exist. Well, it did on Friday at Pink Up Penrith. It was precious and special, just like the amazing community spirit we are fortunate to have in our community of Lindsay. The butterfly was on display to fundraise for Pink Up Penrith and the

        to lead this fantastic cause. I often say that in Lindsay we are full to the brim and overflowing with community spirit, and we know that Penrith will again band together to raise much-needed funds for local breast care nurses, who help so many families affected by breast cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many years, the Penrith community has supported this fantastic initiative. Because of our community, two breast care nurses have been appointed at Nepean Hospital to help those who are diagnosed with breast cancer and their families through this journey. There are 151 McGrath breast care nurses in Australia, and since 2005 they have supported over 90,000 families. For many women, going through breast cancer can be a lonely and isolating process, and they do endure a lot. But these women are strong and have the love and support of family, friends and the breast care nurses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across our community, local businesses like Nepean News, Complete Recruitment Solutions and Poles Patisserie as well as community groups, schools and families have come together to raise money for Pink Up Penrith. It was wonderful to join our community on Friday at the Regatta Centre and see the beautiful butterfly on display. The floral backdrop provided the opportunity for many people to come together for photos, and I was really proud to take my mum, Rhonda, and sister, Karen, along too. The Orchard Hills Men's Shed created this butterfly, along with talented local artists and business owners from across Penrith and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It was absolutely beautiful, and it was developed because the Men's Shed during the coronavirus was under difficult circumstances and wanted to do something for the community. Linda Kemp and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        sponsored the butterfly and painted it with Maralyn Kastel from the Nepean Art Society as well as Naomi Stevenson from Green Magic Homes and local artist Jane Paul. This beautiful butterfly is all about the spirit of community. We've seen the best of our community and the strength and resilience of our community spirit throughout the challenges of the bushfires and the flooding earlier in the year and now the coronavirus pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        We heard from Linda Kemp at this event, whose determination and perseverance saw her defeat breast cancer, and we celebrated that together. Pink Up Penrith has raised over $96,000. It was a special time to share the day with our community, and I thank everyone who made it possible, particularly Gai Hawthorn and the Penrith CBD Corporation for putting the event together and contributing so much to our community.
