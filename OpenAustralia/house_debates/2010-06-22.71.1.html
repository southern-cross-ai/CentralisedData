        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4324" rel="nofollow">
         Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010
        </a>
        in partnership with the bill—will establish a new national scheme for the disclosure of commercial office building energy efficiency. The bill has been reviewed by the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee and by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The government is grateful to both committees and those who made submissions during the inquiry process. The government has considered the recommendations and comments made by the Senate committees to which I have referred. The government has also heard the industry’s requests for some additional changes to the bill to address a number of issues. The amendments that I am proposing on behalf of the government respond directly to the issues raised through those consultation processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government seeks to amend the transitional provisions available during the first 12 months of the scheme. These amendments will allow building owners to use recognised energy efficiencies issued before or during the transitional period in lieu of full building energy efficiency certificates. This will ensure appropriate transitional arrangements are in place for building owners to adjust to the full requirements of the scheme. Furthermore, the amendments ensure that authorities appointed to issue building energy certificates are competent and have appropriate processes in place for issuing certificates.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments also incorporate changes to the penalties for ongoing contraventions while still maintaining an appropriate deterrent against noncompliance. Lower maximum penalties will apply for each additional day beyond the first day that a contravention continues. Taken together, these amendments demonstrate the government’s willingness to work cooperatively with industry to set up a robust national scheme that will provide credible and meaningful energy efficiency information to prospective purchasers and lessees. This is an important measure in helping to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. I commend the amendments to the House.
