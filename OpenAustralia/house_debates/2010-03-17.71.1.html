          The member for Canning should be very careful about making reflections that are not so sotto voce that they cannot be heard by the chair—reflections which a chair, from time to time, could take as reflections upon the chair. I just give him that gentle reminder.

             Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you give a lot of latitude to questions on both sides of the House, but I think that one is going so far outside the bounds—and the member for Banks knows it, too—that you really should rule it out of order as containing entirely irrelevant matter, hypotheticals, the casting of aspersions and so forth. It is full of lies and all of it should be withdrawn.

                  Thank you. The member will resume his seat. As an experienced member of the House, the member for Banks might have chosen his words a bit more precisely. But, on the point that is central to what the member for Sturt has put before me, I refer to my ruling earlier in the week on argumentative content of questions that has been allowed in the past.

I would not suggest that the Leader of the Opposition would make that accusation directly against his mentor, the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, but if you go to the budget papers of 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 and what was going to happen in the subsequent forward estimates for the following year, 2007-08, you do not just have a billion dollars ripped out; you have more than that.

                                Order! You are all comedians, but I do not know whether the public out there really think it is all that funny. Yet again, the member for Sturt thinks he can speak whenever he likes. He should really look at the standing orders, which say that members cannot interrupt. I was about to be very charitable to him, because I could consider that this was simply a point of order that was designed to interrupt, given that previously in this parliament—as best I can do in monosyllables, which may be difficult—I explained to him that that standing order does not apply to question time. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.

                                 training places. This is not your average drive-by gouge—this was a megagouge. This took a lot of money out of the system. This does not just go to the Leader of the Opposition’s record as health minister on allocations to the hospitals; it goes to how he describes his record.

There was a removal of about $300 million—that is true. What he was seeking to do on that occasion was simply to cover up what he had done and was responsible for, and he was subsequently found out for it.

                                           It is not just that those opposite are so sensitive on health policy and so sensitive on the question of how you deal with a record which has a billion dollars being ripped out of the system; it goes to the credibility of those opposite on the question of policy in general. What we have seen so far from those opposite is every degree of sensitivity about any policy concerning health. We have seen where that went in recent days on paid parental leave—that great policy announcement which emerged from nowhere about a week or so ago. It rose as this great, bright shining beacon of new policy from those opposite and then it disappeared without a trace.

We know that he has a big interest in politics and we know that he has a big interest in one-liners, but on health policy there has not been a question all week. His great new policy innovation, which is paid parental leave, rose one day and then disappeared without trace. Beyond that, we have the third party endorsements of his policy which have been so richly delivered by none other than

                                                 So, whether it is health policy, economic policy or tax policy, we have a Leader of the Opposition who is not interested in policy at all. On health and hospitals we have waited for a question on this all day from the Leader of the Opposition. You would think that, looking at the concern which the Australian people have about the future of their hospital beds, the future of doctors and the future of nurses, just one question would come forth from those opposite on health and hospitals, but there was not one. What has their response been? To try to shut the parliament down.

Instead, when he was health minister, he ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system and then put a cap on

He gave that rock-solid, ironclad guarantee that nothing would ever happen with the Medicare safety net. But it all got summed up yesterday when, on the future of the health and hospital system he said, ‘We were gunna do it on the eve of the last election.’ Well, the Leader of the Opposition had better do a bit more ‘gunna-ing’ between now and the next election on health and hospitals, because his record is appalling and his plans are non-existent. I ask that further questions be placed on the
