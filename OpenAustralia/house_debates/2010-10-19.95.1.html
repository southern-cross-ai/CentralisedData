        I have already spoken in the House about the unique beauty and joys of life on the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . In my first speech to the House I mentioned that I was a chronic optimist. It helps me maintain my optimism that I wake up and look out every day over the magnificent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Water
        </a>
        . It is something I recommend to every member of this chamber. The Central Coast is only a four-hour drive from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Rather than flying home on a Thursday afternoon, I suggest members consider splitting their sitting fortnight and meeting their nearest and dearest at Davistown. A weekend of relaxation in Central Coast style is sure to await you.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Sunday would be a good time to take up that offer, as a team of dedicated local volunteers will be holding the annual Davistown Putt Putt Regatta and Wooden Boat Festival.

          You could probably go past that too and enjoy the scenic view. The regatta is in its 13th year. It is a tradition on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Water" rel="nofollow">
           Brisbane Water
          </a>
          that goes back to the turn of the last century and it was revived a few years back by local putt putt enthusiasts. For the information of this chamber, a putt putt boat ranges in length from 14 to 18 feet. It is powered by a single or twin cylinder inboard petrol engine from two to 10 horsepower, which gives that distinctive putt putt sound.
         </p>
         <p>
          This year a fleet of 75 heritage putt putt boats and onlookers and supporters will be plying the Brisbane Water. Anyone who lives on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
           Central Coast
          </a>
          knows that this is a great family day out. Members may be familiar with that famous quote from the
          <i>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_in_the_Willows" rel="nofollow">
            Wind in the Willows

          :
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There is nothing, absolutely nothing, half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.
         </p>
         <p>
          That pretty much sums up the Davistown putt putt regatta and life on the Brisbane Water in general. The flotilla will be led by a boat from Anderson’s Boatshed, the last commercial boatshed on the Brisbane Water.
         </p>
         <p>
          The organisers tell me that one of the aims of the regatta and festival is to foster an appreciation for the putt putts amongst an upcoming generation of boatbuilders. It is great that some golden gurus in the boatbuilding industry on the Central Coast are working to ensure their skills are passed on. I know that in the past one ‘putter’, as they are known, was drawn from a woodwork class from a local school.
         </p>
         <p>
          The event that I mentioned is organised entirely by volunteers. I would like to pay a special tribute to this year’s coordinator, Darren Isaacs, and his co-coordinator,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock" rel="nofollow">
           John Hancock
          </a>
          . I met John at the Ferryman cafe during the election campaign. John is an absolute gentleman. The major sponsors for the event are Central Coast Motor Group,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">

          and Davistown

           RSL
          </a>
          . Messing about in boats is a great part of the Central Coast way of life. I wish all the participants in the Davistown Putt Putt Regatta and Wooden Boat Festival all the best for this Sunday’s event and I hope that I can join them with my family.
