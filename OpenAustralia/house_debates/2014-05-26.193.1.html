        It was a big day for the Aldinga Football Club on Saturday. The Aldinga Football Club has over this season been struggling a little, and there was a huge push by the community and by the footy club and in particular
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Crawford" rel="nofollow">
         Shane Crawford
        </a>
        , who came down on Saturday to play for the Aldinga Sharks. The good news is that the Aldinga Sharks won. They won quite convincingly against

        </a>
        . This was one of the biggest things, I think, the Aldinga Football Club has seen, with

        flying in on a helicopter. It was a big boost for the club and I was so pleased they won.

       <p>
        I would like to mention O'Sullivan Beach because they were great sports about it and really put up a big fight. They are an important football club in the local area. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Football_League" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Football League
        </a>
        , which both of these clubs are part of, do a great job in ensuring young people in our community get the opportunity to play football and compete in the local area. They support not just the A-grade teams but also all the youngsters who are giving it a go. I would like to congratulate and thank all the volunteers at these clubs but also the wider Southern Football League for the work they do in ensuring kids can participate in football. And I thank the crowds for turning up and spurring on Aldinga. Let us hope their season is a little more successful.
