        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Canberra for coming out in their thousands—1,800, to be precise—yesterday morning to take part in the DonateLife Walk 2011. The walk was launched by the Parliamentary Secretary for

        Yesterday the girls were out in full force again, and they were the only ones to make the sun hats look glamorous and cool, much to the chagrin of everyone else! They were supported by Daramalan and Marist colleges and the boys and girls grammar schools. Teams from the

        I would like to thank the members and senators who joined us for the walk yesterday morning, particularly those new members of the Parliamentary Friends of Organ and Tissue Donation that the member for Brisbane and I established a few weeks ago, in time for DonateLife Week this week. Finally, I would like to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for yesterday’s appointment of four well-known Australians as DonateLife ambassadors. The new ambassadors,
