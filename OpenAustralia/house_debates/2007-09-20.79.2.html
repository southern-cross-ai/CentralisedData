         Not accepted. I then move:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition detailing to the House his smear allegation against the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the Government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have moved to suspend the standing and sessional orders so that the Leader of the Opposition can come to this dispatch box now and, with his own mouth, make the allegations that he is putting through the member for Jagajaga and through the member for Grayndler, which he does not have the decency to put himself.
        </p>
        <p>
         You cannot come into this place and sit there and pretend you have nothing to do with what is going on. You cannot come into this place and turn your back and studiously write nothing on a piece of paper and pretend that those who are getting up around you have nothing to do with you. I have an unfortunate fact for the Leader of the Opposition: these are your team. These are your people; they work on your instructions. As anybody who has been around this place long enough knows, nobody can come to the dispatch box on the opposition side and ask a question unless the Leader of the Opposition authorises them to do so. It is absolutely inconceivable that the member for Jagajaga could have walked to this dispatch box, could have put a slur on the Prime Minister, could have put a slur on the government, could have put a slur on the Liberal Party, except that she was authorised to do so by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         , the Leader of the Opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         As for this saintly persona, that he is some kind of pale imitation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer" rel="nofollow">
          Dietrich Bonhoeffer
         </a>
         —that just makes the fraud worse, frankly. To hide behind this saintly image, when you are prepared to have other people go out and do your dirty work for you, actually makes the fraud worse.
        </p>
        <p>
         So what are the allegations that are now being put by Kevin Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, against the Prime Minister? The first insinuation and allegation that has been put is that somehow the Prime Minister, the government or the Liberal Party put out a story in relation to his health. Aside from wishing him a long life, which I am sure we all do, nobody on this side of the parliament has any interest at all in his medical conditions. I have no more interest in his medical conditions, or any of his frontbenchers’ medical conditions, than I hope they have interest in my medical conditions.

          Oh? You do have great interest, do you? I would have thought that was a smear, was it not? Perhaps you could go and talk to people about it. But we find out, do we not, on the Channel 7 news today—and Channel 7 would know about this—that Smith, who I believe to be

           All right, it wasn’t this Smith—it was another Smith. I take it back; it must have been a reporter—it was a Smith, certainly, because I have the transcript—who said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           There was no need to dig dirt.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">

           revealed he had a transplant three and a half years ago on Seven

           .
          </p>
          <p>
           So, far from this being a great secret, who in fact had revealed this piece of information? None other than the Leader of the Opposition himself! And when it becomes public, who does he try and frame up and fit up with the allegation? None other than the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the government. To think that the government would bother itself with a medical condition that occurred many years ago. He is on political life support; he is not on medical life support.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here we were yesterday when he showed himself to be an ignoramus on tax policy. He cannot name a single rate; he cannot name a single threshold. He has been humiliated in the House of Representatives. And so what would be the logical thing for the government to do? Try and knock that story off the evening news bulletins with an old story about a heart condition? Who in their right mind would think about doing this? Who in their right mind might have the motivation to knock that story off the evening news? I was very surprised myself to see that this story came up last night and knocked the tax story down the batting order on Channel 9. We had the Leader of the Opposition sitting there giving one of his serious exclusives to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Oakes" rel="nofollow">
            Laurie Oakes
           </a>
           in relation to the medical condition. All right, the medical condition came out last night—but to say that the government would have spiked its own story by putting that out yesterday beggars belief. Let us ask: what possible motivation would there have been? If you don’t want to look at motivation, let me say what the facts are: the government had nothing to do with that, the Liberal Party had nothing to do with that and the Prime Minister had nothing to do with that. To come in here and put up the member for Jagajaga to try and make that insinuation is low, base politics and it tells us something about the low, base nature of the Leader of the Opposition.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just in case you thought this was not a planned tactic today, we then had the old member for Grayndler, old Mr Dirty Tricks himself, come to the dispatch box. He comes out with this article that was in the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           some time ago—June, I think it was. Was he so concerned about it in June that he got up and asked a question when it was in the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           ? He has been asking about it every day since June, has he? Did he ask about it on Tuesday? Did he ask about it on Wednesday? So concerned about that article in June, he was, that he just happens to get up in a coordinated way, with the member for Jagajaga, and he says, ‘Poor old Kevin’—poor old Kevin has been subject to a bit of search and scrutiny in relation to his private affairs. I can tell you: I have been in public life for 17 years, I have been the Treasurer for 11 years, and it is not a new thing to have scrutiny of your personal life—it is not a new thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mr Speaker, if you think somebody looking at your financials is a new thing, I do not think you were in this House when
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Evans" rel="nofollow">
            Gareth Evans
           </a>
           got up and attacked my wife for owning shares. I do not think you were in the House when that happened. I do not think you were in the House when

            Second World War
           </a>
           . Oh, boy, we have seen some attacks in this House over the years! We have seen some personal attacks. The Leader of the Opposition, far from having personal attacks, has probably had the easiest run from the media as a Leader of the Opposition in a very long period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
           It has been an easy run but, at the first sign, he shows himself to be extremely fragile and extremely touchy. He is willing to try to impeach the reputation of other people in order to make a political point. This is not the character nor the behaviour of somebody who is ready to take tough decisions if he ever gets into a position of responsibility in this country. This is not the position of someone who wants to talk about policy. This is the last question time—

            It could well be the last question time before the election—and, as far as you are concerned, you would want it to be the last question time. But do we hear about policy? Do we hear about plans? Do we hear about any of those things? No, we hear an attempt to smear and we hear an attempt to divert. He ought to get on his feet and he ought to explain.

                        The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Treasurer has moved a motion to suspend standing orders and the Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment. I call the Leader of the Opposition—and, in calling him, I would ask all members to show a little bit more courtesy.

                         When it comes to the behaviour of this Treasurer, the gap between courage and performance, the gap between a person who consistently and routinely badmouths the Prime Minister yet who stands up at the ‘bully pulpit’ of the ministerial dispatch box and then proclaims to the country at large that he is a person of strong heart and strong courage, underlines the deep hypocrisy which resides in your breast.

That is the first time that has been put into the public debate and those opposite know it. Treasurer, you aspire to be the Prime Minister of this country. You have moved this motion in the House. You lack the courage to ever be Prime Minister of this country.

                                              I am more than happy to, Mr Speaker. Over there we have them carrying on as if offended by the allegation that they put together dirt files, as if offended by the allegation that they go after members of this parliament personally, when the evidence is there for all to see. Let us listen to the evidence. We have spent this week hearing about how a government staff member, a chief of staff to a minister, made one of the most repulsive allegations you can make against another human being—that is, to compare them to a Nazi, to someone who administered a concentration camp where thousands of people died. When we first raised that in this parliament, what action or what answer did we get from the Howard government? Not an answer about immediate action, not an answer about revulsion, not an answer about how they were disgusted by that remark—no. On the first occasion the minister walked to the dispatch box, he squirmed and said absolutely nothing.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              Then, on the second occasion he walked to the dispatch box, he obviously thought better of it and sought to distance himself—ever so softly—from the remark. Of course, his chief of staff had been out that morning basically carrying on and justifying himself. It took absolutely hours for this matter to finally end up in an apology from the staff member involved and still, of course, no Howard government minister—not one of them—has taken any meaningful action about this matter.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              Then on the matter that the Leader of the Opposition referred to, which dealt with me, what we know, on the public record, is that a journalist, Jason Koutsoukis, was invited down to a meeting in a ministerial suite for the purpose of being supplied with a file with my name on it which had been trawled through the press gallery as a dirt file. I am not saying, when we look at this, that we should be talking about the contents—I do not know what the contents are; the dirt file has not been supplied to me—but the suggestion—

                                                     For the members of this government to suggest that somehow they are mortally offended by the suggestion that they peddle dirt—how does anyone explain that? Whose office was it? Do we have an answer to that? Whose office was it, Prime Minister? You are so concerned about the reputation of your government, are you going to make inquiries about that? Are you going to make sure you find out the truth about that? That is all right, is it? Your little moral outrage only goes so far and under the moral outrage on the surface there is all of this unseemly conduct going on underneath that you avert your eyes from but you know is occurring—you must know is occurring. So do not come into this parliament with a holier-than-thou attitude when, beneath this modicum of moral outrage on the surface, underneath we have the trawling, the dirt and the carry-on.

                                                     We come to question time in this parliament and we ask questions for the purpose of getting answers. What do we routinely see from ministers in this government? We see evasion and we see personal attacks. Indeed, the only thing some government ministers do in this place during question time is make personal attacks—the only thing they do. When they are asked questions by their own backbench about government policy, they are lucky if there are two or three words about government policy and the rest of it is personal attack. This is the ordinary stock-in-trade of this government when it comes to the prosecution of its politics, and we know that this is just the start and that there are weeks and weeks of this to come in the future. It has been talked about. It has been rumoured.

The point of order is: I would ask you to rule on the meaning of the term ‘without interruption’ in the motion. Does this mean that the Prime Minister is able to make any accusation, any claim, without the right of a member to make a point of order or to demand a withdrawal? Is that the meaning of the term ‘without interruption’ in this motion—to protect him from the kind of the treatment that the Leader of the House put out to the Leader of the Opposition while he was speaking?

The question is that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister speaking without interruption for 10 minutes on the question that the words proposed to be omitted by the Leader of the Opposition stand part of the question.

I invite you to rule as to the meaning of the phrase ‘without interruption’ that has just been passed by the House, as to whether that means that if the Prime Minister makes any accusation against a member that member is unable to respond and if the Prime Minister makes any claim nobody can raise a point of order. Is that your interpretation?

What in effect the member for Jagajaga was doing, presumably with the authority of the Leader of the Opposition, was alleging that either I or, with my knowledge, members of the government had raised issues about the physical health of the Leader of the Opposition. That is how it started. By any measure, by any use of the English language, an accusation of that kind in the absence of evidence supporting it represents about the basest possible smear that can be made in this place. That is why we decided to move a motion inviting the true author of that base accusation to substantiate to the parliament why he believed that I or members of my government were responsible for smearing him in relation to his health.

I do not wish him well politically but I wish him no harm on a personal basis, nor do I wish him other than a long and healthy and happy life as an individual. I would suggest that any Australians in the gallery that may be listening to this debate are, frankly, if I can put it bluntly, more interested in the health of their nation than they are in the health of either the Leader of the Opposition or me.

What the Labor Party has endeavoured to do all of this year is to construct in the minds of the Australian people the belief that any attack on the Leader of the Opposition is a personal smear of the Leader of the Opposition, that you are not allowed to criticise the Leader of the Opposition, that he is the one political leader in Australian history who we are not entitled to question or we are not entitled to attack.

It’s a smear.’ Could I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he has only been in politics since 1998 and a number of us have been in politics for a long time. If he imagines that what has been said about his lack of experience, what has been said about his knowledge deficit in relation to taxation and what has been said about his glass jaw represent a personal attack and a personal smear, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker: you haven’t been born.

He has not been born in Australian politics to understand that. I regard the attempt by the Labor Party to implicate us in this smear as a base diversion. The Leader of the Opposition has utterly failed to produce any evidence to support his claim. What is more, he was too gutless to ask the question himself. He should have got up at the first instance. He did not have the courage to do that and he stands condemned as a result.

The original question was that the motion be agreed to, to which the Leader of the Opposition has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

If this is a serious debate about matters before the House and matters before the nation, why is that particular procedural device necessary to protect the Prime Minister from the indignity of points of order? I find it extraordinary that the Leader of the House would seek to protect the Prime Minister in such a fashion rather than allow the Prime Minister to fend for himself, as other members of this chamber are required to do.

                                                                                                                                                The motion before us asks why these questions have been put to the parliament today. The answer is that the function of the parliament is to provide the executive with the opportunity to answer questions put to it by the opposition. These are matters which therefore demand answers. What we have had from those opposite today is a sense of continued feigned indignation, as if any negative smear campaign has been mysteriously pulled out of space, with which those opposite have had nothing whatsoever to do—no awareness whatsoever on the part of the Prime Minister or on the part of anybody else. But look carefully at the Prime Minister’s response to the questions which were asked: ‘I, the Prime Minister, have no awareness of any such activity. I am not responsible for it and I am not aware of others in the Liberal Party and the government.’ We have heard that through ‘children overboard’; we have heard that through the ‘wheat for weapons’ scandal; we have heard it time in and time out as you have sought to avoid accountability in this parliament.

I find it remarkable that a government of courage and a Prime Minister of courage have to hide behind such procedural devices to avoid accountability.

The Prime Minister’s conspiracy theory runs along these lines: after a press conference I conducted at Queanbeyan yesterday, I came back into this chamber and organised through my office an exclusive interview with

That is the proposition; the Prime Minister just put that. There is a little problem with that conspiracy theory, because Laurie Oakes came and saw me yesterday morning before I went anywhere near Queanbeyan. Laurie Oakes came to my office to put these particular matters which had been put to him. So the prime ministerial conspiracy theory is that we have a press conference out at Queanbeyan—

Furthermore, we are advised that this story had come forward from a source hostile to the Labor Party. Furthermore, the contents of the story ran along these lines: it contained the date of the medical procedure which I had, it had also the details of the doctor who supposedly performed the procedure, though the name of the doctor was not given to me, and, furthermore, there was a further view put that the source had said that the durability of the aortic valve used in the replacement surgery had a finite duration, it would last 10 years, and therefore my health was in some peril. This was not put to one media outlet; it was put to, we have at least confirmed, three media outlets.

I said I supported organ donations because I had been the beneficiary of one. Furthermore, in private conversations with cardiac patients at various times who have sought some counsel and support I have provided whatever counsel and support that I could.

We were therefore put in a position where I had to respond to the matters which had been put. The reason why the question was put in this House today is that the job of the parliament is to get an answer back from the executive as to whether these things are true. But it does not stop there. The question is asked, particularly by the Leader of the House, as to why we could possibly suspect that the government may be involved in anything untoward. Here we have, in the

I think there is a reasonable basis for looking at that.

Let us remember a certain individual called Senator Heffernan. The Prime Minister has made reference to all these indignations in the past. Prime Minister, you have a responsibility when it comes to either backing or overturning remarks by Senator Heffernan. What did Senator Heffernan have to say about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? And what did you say in response to that immediately? ‘But look, I’m not telling people what they should apologise for or not; I’m just stating my own view.’ In other words, when that foul language was used by Senator Heffernan in relation to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, what the Prime Minister sought to do was quickly step to one side—’Nothing to do with me; it’s old Bill there, running off the tracks. I don’t have anything to do with that.’ Then what happens? The heat gets too much, the political reaction around the country gets too solid and suddenly the Prime Minister has to change his tune later on. The reason we moved an amendment earlier on, which the government was not prepared to take, was that all these questions go to the absolute heart of the integrity of the operations of this government.

The standing and sessional orders have been suspended to allow the Leader of the Opposition to detail the smear allegations to the House. I would ask that you bring him back to detailing those allegations.

Do you know why, Prime Minister? Because Laurie Oakes came to see me before I went anywhere near Queanbeyan. Three journalists came to us with the pieces of information that I referred to before, and we were also informed that the sources came from those hostile to the Labor Party.

I notice that once again the Leader of the House does not seek to extend the same sort of procedural protection to the likes of me as he sought to extend to the Prime Minister, and did so successfully. Once again, there is a series of interruptions as the response provided by me is delivered. Prime Minister, the country wants to have a debate about plans for the future. Do you know something, Prime Minister: you were extended that opportunity in the parliament today and you declined. The nation wants to know what your plans are for the future of the education system, because there is nothing there.
