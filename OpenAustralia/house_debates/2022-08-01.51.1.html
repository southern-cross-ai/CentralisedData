       <p>
        I take this opportunity to thank my local community for returning me to the parliament as the member for Lalorâ€”a very personal thankyou to the electorate of Lalor, who, with me, celebrate that I don't just return for the fourth time in this House but I return on this side of the House and that they were involved in delivering a Labor government. I know what a Labor government means to the people of my electorate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        needed another reminder, an election campaign certainly reminded me. My community worked tirelessly to send me back to Canberra. They worked tirelessly to deliver a Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Henry Barlow, a long-time servant of the Labor Party on a volunteer basis, who worked tirelessly on my campaign. He led a team that reflected our multicultural community. Leaders across our multicultural, multifaith community assisted in my campaign because they know how important a Labor government is for a community like ours, a community that is in a growth corridor, a community where needs are new every day, where the growth means that, as soon as one thing is delivered, another need arises. They know that a Labor government and I would be here to deliver for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank my partner, John, and my sons, Michael, Anthony and James, for their support in what has been a trying time. They were fabulous, and I love them dearly.
