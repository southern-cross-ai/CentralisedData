       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge a local success story in my electorate of Holt. It relates to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield_Fountain_Gate" rel="nofollow">
         Westfield Fountain Gate
        </a>
        Shopping Centre. Its origins were in a shopping centre that was created in 1970. From that small shopping centre, it has grown into one of the most impressive shopping centres in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next week Westfield Foundation Gate is going to open the first stage of its $320 million redevelopment. In the construction process so far it has created about 1,500 jobs in construction. Given the weakness of the local economy at the moment, this is important. These are new jobs and jobs for our region. As I said, it was developed in 1970. It is currently the fourth largest shopping centre in Australia with the 12th highest retail turnover.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, Westfield Fountain Gate services a trade area of more than 325,000 people. Upon completion, Westfield Fountain Gate with this extension will become the second largest shopping centre in Australia to Chadstone. It will have a service area of about 171,000 square metres.
       </p>
       <p>
        The investment by Westfield, which is a $300 million investment, an investment in our local community and local jobs, will see approximately 114 additional shops, which would bring when it is completed about 444 shops in the shopping centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the full redevelopment, Westfield will comprise a full-time Myer department store, Big W, Kmart,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Scarfe" rel="nofollow">

        and an expanded Target. Supermarkets will include a relocated brand new Coles, Woolworths and Aldi. Local residents can also look forward to a brand new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGI_Friday's" rel="nofollow">

        , which will be added to their new dining precinct, which is pretty good considering the businesses that are in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the good issues is Westfield's commitment, and what symbolises Westfield's commitment to the local area is that they are going to employ 800 permanent retail workers. As I said, the retailers are doing it pretty tough down our way. Given this investment in both construction and also in terms of jobs—to invest in retail with 800 permanent jobs—it is a great thing for our area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government has worked in partnership with Westfield with respect to disadvantaged and Indigenous employees. We are trying to bring more of these employees into the retail sector. I think that is a great credit to Westfield that they are doing that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Westfield Fountain Gate is located in one of the largest growth corridors in Australia. It is adapting to change and meeting the changing needs of the community. Westfield has a commitment to the area. People that live near Fountain Gate feel that they own the shopping centre. There is a great sense of pride and community in that shopping centre. It has been a hub. It is a place where people have met for well over 10 years. It is a meeting place. I congratulate Westfield, and it will be my great honour to be there at the opening of stage 1 of the exciting new investment in the area.
