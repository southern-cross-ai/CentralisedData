       <p>
        Maintaining a sense of community has been tough this year, but I wanted to commend several groups in Wentworth who have risen to this challenge.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayside_Chapel" rel="nofollow">
         Wayside Chapel
        </a>
        provides essential services and supplies to vulnerable people and support for people who are socially isolated or homeless. They've adapted their service model during COVID to provide more outreach rather than centre based services. A few weeks back, I visited Wayside and spoke to the pastor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Owen" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and staff as they packed their bags ready for a night walking the streets to locate and support those in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the pleasure of visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COA" rel="nofollow">
         COA
        </a>
        during one of their community lunches a few weeks back. COA provide weekly lunches along with COVID-safe seated singing and activities for elderly residents in the area. COA have buses to transport their community to and from the lunches so that all who want to can attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge here the inspiring efforts of one Wentworth local, Saxon Graham, who I had the pleasure of spending some time with earlier this month. Saxon is a well-known figure in the community who persistently seeks to assist others and make a contribution. For over 20 years, he has enthusiastically volunteered and assisted at the Holdsworth Community Centre, helping elderly residents with their shopping and their transport needs. Particularly during the uncertainty of current times, Saxon's familiar smiling face has been a comfort to many. I would like to congratulate Saxon, the Holdsworth centre, COA and Wayside Chapel for their efforts to keep those most in need socially connected and supported during these difficult times.
