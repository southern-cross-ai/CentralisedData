What the government are trying to cover up here is apparent. They are trying to cover up the fact that this bill was brought to this parliament as part of a poll-driven cover-up.

                 <p>
                  I would like to thank the honourable members of the House and the Senate for their input in the debate on the
                  <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2809" rel="nofollow">
                   Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Bill 2007
                  </a>
                  . For the information of the opposition, all of the government is 100 per cent behind this bill, and any one of us would stand here and pass these amendments. I am pleased to note that this bill as amended in the Senate was returned to the House today for this place’s approval. In addition to parliamentary debates, this bill was the subject of a Senate standing committee inquiry, and the final report was handed down last week. I also thank the committee for their work. During the debates we have heard a range of views about a matter that is at the heart of Australian work values: fairness.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The members of the opposition whom we have heard from cannot accept that workers and their bosses can make agreements themselves without union involvement. We happen to think that they can. We have heard much comment that fairness is obtuse and too hard to understand. Quite obviously we do not agree. We have heard that, without reams of prescriptive detail, workers and their bosses will find it impossible to inject fairness into their own agreements. Quite obviously that is patent nonsense. And yet, when the government moved amendments to strengthen the information requirements so that the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_Authority" rel="nofollow">
                   Workplace Authority
                  </a>
                  Director must gazette a fact sheet about such things as the standard and protected award conditions, the opposition voted against them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This government is serious about providing genuine protections and ensuring that everybody knows where they stand. Therefore, the bill leaves no doubt about what constitutes fairness and that the overriding consideration in determining fairness is the value of compensation provided to employees. Importantly, it does so in a way that maintains the flexibility for workers and businesses to reach agreements that suit their particular needs. Flexibility in the workplace is going to see our participation rise and allow all Australians to have their family-work balance needs met.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This bill reflects the fact that the government is listening to the community. We have responded to concerns about the treatment of award conditions in agreement making. We have also been prepared to address technical issues raised during the Senate inquiry. The government moved amendments in the Senate to clarify that employees in industries or occupations that were traditionally covered by state awards also have the benefit of the fairness test. The amendments also clarify what must be taken into account when calculating compensation where agreements fail the fairness test. Government amendments made in the Senate also set out how the fairness test operates when there is a transmission of a business. This means that if a workplace agreement has been lodged and has commenced then the Workplace Authority Director must still apply the fairness test, regardless of a subsequent transmission of business.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The government also accepted amendments moved by
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
                   Senator Fielding
                  </a>
                  . These amendments extend the length of the period of preservation of redundancy entitlements where an agreement is unilaterally terminated by the employer from 12 months to 24 months. I would like to remind the House that we amended the legislation late last year to ensure that redundancy provisions in agreements were preserved for a period of 12 months after such agreements were unilaterally terminated by employers. These amendments were not supported by the Labor Party. This bill provides important protections for employees in agreement making while ensuring that the fundamentals of the government’s workplace relations reforms remain in place.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Before finishing, I would just like to return once more to the fact sheets, which have caused Labor so much excitement and interest. When you consider
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                   ALP
                  </a>
                  policy, you can see that the statements made by the opposition are in fact completely hypocritical. Under Labor’s national employment standards—in fact, on page 8, under ‘Forward and fairness’—employers will be obliged to provide all new employees with a fair work information statement, which contains prescribed information about the employee’s rights and entitlements at work, including the right of the employee to choose whether to be or not to be a member of a union and where to go for information and assistance. It is quite explicit. It is one of the minimum legislative standards that they would put in place if they were in government. The idea is that employers must supply their employees with an information statement. Our concern about that, though, is that it is in fact a disguised effort to make sure that employees end up with a lot of information about how to join a union. We would be concerned about the pressure that would go along with all of that if it was once again a union dominated workplace. I strongly recommend these amendments to the Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Bill 2007. I commend the amendments to the House.

It is a crisis about taxpayer funded polling that is no doubt keeping the minister from being in parliament today to handle this bill. How laughable: the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations not only is not here to handle his bill but was not here to vote on the divisions in relation to his bill. Since question time today, no doubt he has been spinning in crisis about his inability to rule out that taxpayer funded research has been given to Liberal Party operatives.

                     <p>
                      Absolutely—I do realise that. The relevant point is: where is the minister? Moving on from that point, now I have seen everything. The government, desperate for a defence for its workplace propaganda sheets is now saying, ‘We’ve pinched something out of Labor’s policy.’ Did you think that you would ever see that in industrial relations—a minister of the Howard government saying, ‘Don’t blame me; I got it out of Labor’s policy’? If you are so bereft of ideas, so stupid, so silly that you cannot think up things yourself and have to take them out of Labor’s policy then get to the dispatch box and say that.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The government has pulled a stunt here to stop Labor voting against its propaganda sheets. Let me explain to the minister why we object to these propaganda sheets when our policy includes the provision of information to people. These are propaganda sheets. If they were not propaganda sheets then the format of them would have been supplied with the legislation. But of course the government has not done that; the government has made sure that it can draft these sheets afterwards. No doubt
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Textor" rel="nofollow">
                       Mark Textor
                      </a>
                      will have a very big hand in that; no doubt it will all be about the polling. Why does an employer have to get these sheets into the hands of employees within three months? Why not six months? Why not 12 months? Why not two years? Why aren’t these sheets for newly starting employees? Why aren’t these sheets for employees who may be being asked to sign an Australian workplace agreement? The reason for the three-month timetable—and let us be honest; the Australian people are not mugs—is that you want these propaganda fact sheets in the hands of Australian workers before the election. That is why you picked three months; there is no other rationale for picking three months.

                          We will—when you finish with the pollsters, we will see them. But you do not want this parliament to see them before dealing with the legislation. That is too smart by half, Minister. If they are genuinely information fact sheets then why were they not provided with the legislation? The fact that you have left it, to enable you to draft them afterwards, is because you want them to be propaganda, and the three-month time frame is all about pushing propaganda into the hands of workers before the election.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But the real vice in these fact sheets—apart from them being more propaganda from the government—is that the government are going to fine employers for not doing it. If you run a small business today, unless you hand out the Howard government’s propaganda within the three-month time period, you will get a $110 penalty for every employee you fail to get it to. If you are running a small business—a cafe, a drycleaner—and you do not get out the sheets out to your employees in time, the Howard government will come and fine you. This is the Howard government attacking business, and small business in particular. This is regulation gone mad in the interests of political propaganda, and the Howard government did not want Labor members to have a vote on this in this parliament because they knew it was something to be ashamed of and they were hoping to cover it up. This is an absolutely ridiculous approach from the Howard government. We could have dealt with this amendment and had one division. Instead, we have had more because they want to cover up—

                             Apparently, if you are a union boss driven outfit, you do not want people to know that. We believe that every person employed in Australia does need to know that information. So proposed section 154A(3) would allow regulations to prescribe other matters relating to the content, form or manner of providing the workplace relations fact sheet. Proposed section 154B would require an employer to take reasonable steps to provide each employee with a copy of the fact sheet within seven days of commencing employment.

                                    No, I am sorry. The member for Lalor was suggesting that we were not trying to get new employees information. I have just explained that she is being very selective, but we are not surprised by that. Proposed section 154D would also allow a workplace inspector or an affected employee to apply to the Federal Court to impose a penalty on an employer for failing to provide a copy of the fact sheet to the employee. We think that is reasonable because information is power. If you do not know what your rights are then it is possible for you to be exploited or indeed heavied by a union which is hell-bent on making sure that you are bullied into a circumstance that should not otherwise be.

                                    are extremely important for the future prosperity of this country because we have to have a workplace which is flexible and which allows businesses to respond to the environment or the context within which they operate.

                                    We have to have a situation where, if a mother with young children wants part-time work, if a semi-retired person wants job sharing or if someone wants to work from home if the industry is suitable for that, that flexibility is possible in our workplace. That is why, with the flexibility already introduced by our industrial relations reforms, we are seeing more jobs created every week than we have ever seen created in this economy before. We are seeing unemployment rates down to a 33-year low—down to about 4.2 per cent. We are seeing Labor’s peaks of long-term unemployed drop down by 75 per cent. This is an extraordinary outcome for this economy, which, of course, we have managed so effectively. We are also making sure that we can sustain the prosperity of our economy through industrial relations reforms which allow future generations to benefit from employment and the wealth of this nation. I wholeheartedly commend this amendment to the House.

                                     I thank the minister at the dispatch box for proving my case for me. What she has just said to the businesses in this country is that if you do not hand out the propaganda sheet within three months, you can get dragged through the Federal Court and fined. Let us not hear any more nonsense from this government about being pro-business or pro-small business. This government are so desperate to get propaganda out to workers which will use the word ‘fairness’ and the word ‘test’ in a sentence that they are going to bully employers into handing out the sheet within three months, at pain of being dragged through the Federal Court and being fined. The minister at the dispatch box has talked about bullies. Let us be very clear about who the bullies are. The bullies in this situation are the Howard government bullying business to hand out their propaganda. We know this legislation was conceived in polling. We know it has been an excuse for an advertising campaign. Now it is an excuse for a propaganda fact sheet and employers will be bullied, dragged through the Federal Court and fined if they do not hand out the Howard government’s propaganda. There is no other way of reading this legislation. It is a disgrace. It is an attack on Australian business, and there is no other way of reading it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Of course, this afternoon the government has engaged in a procedural manoeuvre so that Labor cannot vote against this amendment without voting against the other amendments. Labor supported the other amendments. Why did we support the other amendments? There was one from Senator Steve Fielding which, while it would not fix things like the Tristar case and the fact that under the Howard government’s laws you can have your redundancy entitlements stripped off you without a cent of compensation, seeks to protect redundancy entitlements after they have been terminated or on transmission of a business for 24 months instead of 12 months, and we are prepared to support that.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The other amendments are here because of the Howard government’s incompetence, because when it drew up this bill it was spending more time with the pollsters and the advertisers than it was with parliamentary counsel. Apart from sheer incompetence, what could explain a government bringing a bill into this parliament which needed to be amended in this House the day after it was introduced? Minister Hockey introduced it on a Monday and amended it on a Tuesday. Then it went to the Senate, and there were so many defects in it that the government had to move another tranche of amendments. What could explain that sheer incompetence? Why is it that this government is incapable of competently writing a piece of legislation? Clearly it is not. Why is it that within 24 hours of moving a bill it has been amended once, and here we are, after the Senate has voted, and it is being amended again? There are technical defects, including defects about awards, littered throughout it. It is laughably bad.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     This is a government that beats its chest in question time about its industrial relations record. Let no-one be in any doubt about what the industrial relations record of this government is: incompetently drafted legislation and hitherto unknown levels of industrial relations bureaucracy. This government is going to spend $1.8 billion on bureaucracy over the forward estimates—complexity, regulation and red tape for employers, to which the government is adding today. Hand out a fact sheet, a propaganda sheet, or get dragged through the Federal Court. And then, of course, there is the gross unfairness to workers which we have seen time after time, as people have lost basic conditions and not got one cent of compensation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Labor will not oppose these amendments, because of the way the government has bundled them together, but they will stand on the parliamentary record for all time as a testament to this government’s appetite for propaganda and its sheer incompetence in being able to legislate on industrial relations.

                                      I repeat: I find it quite extraordinary that it is seen as propaganda when a government aims to get facts about workplace rights into the hands of the employee. Perhaps it is a reflection of the philosophy of a party that is dominated by union bosses—and will be even more dominated by union bosses after the next election. I think that is quite extraordinary. Let me say to the member for Lalor, who talks about incompetent policy: as the architect of Medicare Gold, you would know that was the most incompetent, laughable policy, and it died before the ink was dry. I do not think she has much form when it comes to talking about some of the most important legislation that has been passed since Federation in terms of guaranteeing workers a flexible, fair workplace that is going to match the new era of an ageing population, more women entering the workplace, balancing families with employment and older Australians wanting to remain in the workforce long past the usual age of retirement, which was once, say, 65 for men and 62 for women. Therefore, this amendment bill is important.
