       <p>
        It's with sadness that I advise this chamber that our community recently lost some of its most treasured local and civic minded residents. It's with sadness that I report the death of Sandra Ellmore. Sandra was a local party stalwart and always an enthusiastic participant and supporter. Sometimes her support transcended the polling booth and extended to the home. I still remember her inviting my husband, Ryan, and I around to gift special rocks from her Highett garden to place in ours in Sandringham. We weren't looking for rocks, which was a secondary consideration to her generosity, but it shows the extent to which she thought of others and how she could gift and give to others. She'll be sorely missed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similar is the loss of Sue Hardiman. Sue was honoured by the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rock" rel="nofollow">
         Black Rock
        </a>
        branch recently as a much-loved stalwart and someone who quietly got on with the job without fuss. She was certainly a reliable seller of raffle tickets, and she made sure she missed out on nobody. Sue's passion was also greater than herself, and she became an active volunteer for Very Special Kids for children with life-threatening conditions. In encouraging others to support the charity, she said: 'Very Special Kids is very special to me. I'm a great believer that people should give back, and, when you make a will, you leave it to people who can benefit. It just warms the cockles of your heart.' Behind her seeming sternness was always a lively mind with a forward-looking heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also honour the very liberally minded Shirley Turrell, who moved to Beaumaris when it was still bushland. She understood the critical importance of community life as the foundation for enjoying it, and that was anchored around becoming full participants in community clubs like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and schools. Always rolling up with their beloved Mercedes, she was an active party member, and particularly in the women's section.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley, Sue and Sandra represent what I love about Bayside Liberals—a liberalism that is nonjudgemental, youthful and fun and, frankly, sometimes a little bit cheeky.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also honour the memory of Bob Whiteway
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Bob was a dedicated geography teacher and energetic environmentalist. He taught at Beaumaris high school for 37 years and is remembered by former student Melissa Treverton as one of those teachers who changed lives by believing in and valuing the ideas brewing within the young minds of his students. Bob's years of advocacy saw Ricketts Point declared a marine sanctuary by the state government in 2002. He subsequently founded the volunteer group
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricketts_Point_Marine_Sanctuary" rel="nofollow">
         Ricketts Point Marine Sanctuary
        </a>
        and served as inaugural president to steward the new marine sanctuary. He was recognised as Bayside Citizen of the Year in 2003 for his environmental leadership. The last time I saw Bob was when he was handing out how-to-vote cards at a polling station—and I won't mention for which candidate—but I also saw him regularly at Beaumaris Secondary School events.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all the family and friends who have lost Sandra, Sue, Shirley and Bob, we extend our heartfelt condolences and wish them the best with their loss.
