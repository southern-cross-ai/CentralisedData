       <p>
        Dorothy Harris-Gordon, 'Aunty Dorrie', was an important Aboriginal leader in my community. Indeed, she was the first Aboriginal woman ordained in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        in Australia. Sadly, she passed away recently. Aunty Dorrie was born in 1941 and was a proud Widjabul and Bundjalung woman. She grew up on a reserve outside of Lismore and was the second of five daughters. Kathleen was the eldest, followed by Dorothy then Valerie, Martha and Caroline. Her family says that at just eight years of age, she told her family that one day she would be a chaplain. In 1963 she married the Reverend Charles Harris and, over the next few decades, Aunty Dorrie and Charles worked towards Indigenous equality, land rights and other important movements. Their Christian faith was central throughout these endeavours. Charles passed away in 1993.

       <p>
        In 1999, Aunty Dori was ordained in the Uniting Church, a wonderful moment. She served throughout our region in Goorie Good News Centre in Grafton and the Marmung Uniting Fellowship in Coraki. She also worked in prisons and hospitals. She later married Lindsay Gordon. Aunty Dorrie was a loving mother to Timothy, deceased; Phyllis, deceased; Charles; Sharon; Philip; Cheryl, deceased; John, deceased; and Charmaine. Aunty Dorrie was a leader in our community, a wonderful woman. She will be sadly missed. May she rest in peace.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox" rel="nofollow">
         Charlie Cox
        </a>
        . Charlie died recently and will be sadly missed by our community. Charlie loved Casino and we loved him. As the former mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Valley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Richmond Valley Council
        </a>
        , he was an important leader. He was always dedicated to helping others. He worked as a teacher for most of his adult life. When he retired from teaching, he was almost immediately elected to council and this began a 14-year career of service in local government, eight of those as mayor. Charlie always said it was the children he taught who voted him in. When he retired from teaching, he had been teaching three generations of families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Charlie was heavily involved in organising upgrades to the Casino CBD, improving sewerage for Woodburn and Broadwater, cleaning the

        shore and delivering the Evans Head swimming complex. He was also a key member of the Casino Men's Shed. He loved sports and was an avid Rabbitohs fan. We'll forgive you for that, Charlie. He was a life member of the Evans Head-Casino Surf Life Saving Club and he was also involved with rugby league, soccer and swimming. Karen and I extend our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Robyn, his children and children-in-law, Anthony, Dean and Tracey, and Charlie's grandchildren, Tiana, Riley and Sam. Our community has lost a true gentleman and man who was dedicated to serving our community. Rest in peace, Charlie.
