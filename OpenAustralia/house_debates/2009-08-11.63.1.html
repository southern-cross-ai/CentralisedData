       <p>
        This evening I want to brief and update the House on significant changes to aircraft noise in my electorate of Swan. Most of Perth does not have to pay the price for having a close and convenient airport, but my constituents do. In January my office started to receive a surge of calls from local residents noticing more planes above their houses on new lower trajectories. At a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Airport
        </a>
        Aircraft Noise Management Committee meeting it became clear that other community representatives were experiencing a similar number of complaints. Locals and community representatives did not know why there had been such significant changes. At the meeting a reason emerged. In a presentation by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        , the committee was told that changes had been made to flight paths in November 2008 as a result of the Western Australian Route Review Project. The changes had been directed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        but the consultation process was overseen by Airservices Australia. There had been no consultation whatsoever with the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although I was not an MP and, therefore, not a member of the committee when the changes were being discussed in 2006 and 2007, I understand that other committee members were given the impression that any changes would be minimal. I understand that the concerns raised at the time were largely ignored. I wrote some time ago to Airservices Australia to request understandable information on how these changes have affected each of the suburbs in my electorate of Swan. With the initial absence of a response, I decided to contact members of my electorate with surveys asking if residents had been affected by noise changes and, if so, how. I shall present the responses in due course to Airservices Australia, the committee and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The results so far show how widespread and dramatic the changes have been. Concetta Cinanni, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Queens Park
        </a>
        , said she now cannot even hear when using the phone. She said, ‘The planes fly directly overhead constantly.’ Mr Herbert, of Belmont, said: ‘Yes, I now have more air traffic over my house and vibration and windows rattling and cracks opening as a result. When I bought this house 13 years ago, it was specifically because it wasn’t in the flight path.’
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Francis" rel="nofollow">
         Melissa Francis
        </a>
        , of Rivervale, said: ‘Yes, there are a lot more aircraft flying directly (or very close) over our house. Previously it was very occasional, and we deemed this acceptable upon purchase.’ Swain Johnson, of Rivervale, added: ‘Aircraft now come directly overhead more frequently and early in the morning—windows shake and light fittings have come loose!’ I could go on and on because I have received hundreds of surveys back.
       </p>
       <p>
        The response I have now received from Airservices Australia has confirmed the significant nature of the changes. Given this, questions must be posed about how substantial changes to flight paths could be made with no consultation with the local community. If
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
         CASA
        </a>
        and Airservices Australia have breached their charter then there is no alternative but to reopen the Western Australian Route Review Project. It is also time the House begin considering alternative noise abatement programs for Perth Airport. I have also heard from Mr Ken Healy, from the Magic Men, who has also made comment on noise issues affecting the Perth Airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most major airports around the world that are close to residential areas have noise abatement programs, but Perth seems to have been hard done by over the years.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        airport noise curfews apply at Sydney, Adelaide, Coolangatta and Essendon airports. Noise insulation programs have been run by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Infrastructure
        </a>
        , Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in Sydney and Adelaide. I can find no evidence of any similar noise insulation programs for Perth. These schemes were both justified by sudden increases in airport noise. If the government is not prepared to reopen the Western Australian Route Review Project then Perth is surely also due a noise insulation rebate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The survey results say there is broad support for some form of curfew and a significant proportion would be willing to pay for better insulation if there were a government subsidy. Last week Queens Park resident Max Scott took the time to come into my electorate office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Park
        </a>
        . Max was able to show me airport noise correspondence with governments and airport authorities dating back to 1982. The least that organisations associated with the airport can do is give residents like Max Scott a proper opportunity to have their say.
       </p>
       <p>
        I read with interest Perth Airport’s preliminary draft master plan, a 20-year statutory plan for Perth’s development. I was pleased to read that the airport has a good plan for upgrading the road and infrastructure surrounding the airport, and the overall concept for the airport was, in my view, a fantastic step forward. I made a submission to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westralia_Airports_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Westralia Airports Corporation
        </a>
        and argued for proper consultation, a resolution of the flight path issue and a guarantee that future flight paths will not be altered without community consultation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I fear that the organisations responsible for Perth Airport are not taking their consultation duty with the public seriously enough. I firmly believe that the public must always have an opportunity to have their say. The views of the public must matter and they must be actively taken into account by decision makers.
