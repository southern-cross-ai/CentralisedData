       <p>
        Earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition and I met with a group of very special people. We met with Eddie Blewett and his mums—Claire and Neroli—from Tathra in

        and a whole group of rainbow families and their supporters. I'd hoped that since they were last here, about a year ago, the parliament would have done its job and legislated for marriage equality. Sadly, this Prime Minister has instead delivered a ridiculous $122 million postal survey. None of us wanted it, but we are determined to win it. We've already seen the vitriol that this postal survey is inflicting on the

        community, Australians, their family and their friends. I know that over the next few weeks that times will be very tough for people like Eddie and his friends, but I want to say to them today that we stand with them and that we've got their backs.

        Ballot papers will begin arriving in people's letterboxes over coming days. I urge people to fill in their ballots and post them back as soon as possible; don't get distracted. I urge people to vote 'yes', because I'm voting yes for family like Eddie's, Claire's and Neroli's. I'm voting yes for people I've never met, for someone in a country town who's just coming to terms with their sexuality and who hasn't told anyone yet. I'm voting yes for that person. I'm voting yes because I want a country that supports all its citizens equally.
