        I rise today to congratulate all the various show societies that have functioned, in many cases for over 100 years, within the Lyne electorate. I particularly want to bring to the attention of the House that this weekend the Camden Haven Show Society—under the guidance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Porter" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Porter
        </a>
        , President, and Mavis Barnes, Secretary, and all the committee—are putting on a minishow this weekend, because they had to cope with a category 3 cyclone, the tail of which washed out their show earlier in the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year, I attended the Comboyne show, which was very well attended and suffered from an outbreak of extremely good weather and huge crowds. I want to compliment Rodney and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Fisher" rel="nofollow">
         Sue Fisher
        </a>
        , Marion Ricketts and all the committee on a very successful day. Many people helped them—Kevin Debreceny and many others—too many to mention in this short time. This weekend coming up we have the 105th Wauchope Show—my local town's show. I am sure

        , Neil Coombes, Paul Hoole, Jennifer Markham, Anne Watkins and all the many directors will have another great show. I attended the Gloucester Show on the weekend. We had a bit of drizzle again, but the show did go on. I would like to compliment Howard Shultz, James Hooke,

        , John Ralf, the ring masters, and all the other people for a great show.
       </p>
       <p>
        The show society itself is a great institution in rural Australia. Even in Sydney we have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Easter_Show" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Easter Show
        </a>
        , but it all starts out in rural Australia where people come together. It is a case of people being unselfish and willing to commit their time and energy. We have a celebration of everything rural—whether you are demonstrating your prize beef, dairy, horses, dogs, poultry, wildlife or all the craft—and there is an amazing collection of things to see at a show. There are altogether too many people to thank. In essence, if anyone travels to any agricultural show in the Lyne electorate they are guaranteed to visit a great event. Next door in Kempsey, which is just out of my electorate, we have the Kempsey Show coming up in the coming weeks as well. I am sure all the shows will be well attended and certainly they are appreciated by the community that they serve. I compliment them all and wish them well for the future.
