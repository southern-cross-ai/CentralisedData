       <p>
        I wish to inform the House of grants I recently announced, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandenong_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Dandenong Ranges
        </a>
        environment and bushfire fuel management community grants. In fact, the program will see a massive $2.4 million awarded to local community groups. Back in 2007, under the Howard government, and 2010, I made election commitments of $3 million. Sadly, in 2007 it was not matched by the Labor Party, which came into government. In 2010, we made the same announcement. Again, it was not matched by the Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The great news is that we now have the money on the ground. This is an idea I have been pursuing for a number of years, but we tweaked it a tiny bit—actually, a fair bit—in 2013. That was as a result of a meeting at the Olinda community hall. Previously, the grants were very much centred around weed control in the Dandenong Ranges. After attending a meeting in Olinda I became a lot more wise. Thanks so much to people like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brennan" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Brennan
        </a>
        from the Dandenong Ranges landscape strategy group and community advisory group and Jo Hirst from that group. Approximately 300 people turned up at that meeting. As a candidate I just listened in, that night, to hear what they were talking about. Peter Brennan was talking about the great concern of the bushfire threat in the Dandenong Ranges. It surprised me and many local residents that 60 per cent of bush up in the Dandenong Ranges is on private land, 24 per cent is on crown land and the remainder is on other types of land.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was then I realised that for this commitment—which I was going to make again in 2013—we could potentially use this funding, which was previously going to be used on private land, also on crown land. The big reason for this is that we have issues, for example, where the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        want to do a controlled burn but they cannot do it on private land and they may not be able to do it on crown land. At the same time, environmental groups are really trying to engage private stakeholders to get involved, and sometimes residents are reluctant to get involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the environment minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Hunt
        </a>
        . When we made this commitment he was the one who signed it off and could see its value. It has become a bit of a pilot project, in the Dandenong Ranges, which hopefully will be rolled out right across the nation. I would like to give a very special thanks to Stephen Thuan from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip" rel="nofollow">
         Port Phillip
        </a>
        and Westernport
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA" rel="nofollow">
         CMA
        </a>
        . Stephen and I have had numerous conversations about how best to have the grants rolled out. What we decided to put in place was a panel, and on this panel we would meet the needs of those concerned about the environment and weeds and those concerned about bushfires. Remember, the Dandenong Ranges did suffer the devastation of the 1983
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday" rel="nofollow">

        bushfires, so it is very important.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was great to have Sharon Merritt from the CFA involved. Sometimes we find the CFAs do not want to get involved, but this time we got them on the panel and Sharon has been doing a fantastic job. Thanks also to Steve Pascoe, from the Dandenong Ranges Bushfire Landscape Project Emergency Management Victoria. Again, having him on this committee is vitally important. Thanks to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_McGee" rel="nofollow">
         Barry McGee
        </a>
        of Dandenong Ranges landscape strategy community advisory group for all the work he has done. Thanks also to Gaye Gadsden from Yarra Ranges Council; Bernice Dowling from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Parks Victoria
        </a>

       </p>
       <p>

The groups are: Chandler Hill Parkcare Group, with $2,050 for contract spraying of areas of weed infestation and thank you to Swee Oon for your work; John Hills Landcare Group Incorporated, with $5,000 for weed cap on Avonsleigh Common, and thanks to

        ; to Ion Worrell, $95,000—that is a lot of money. They are going to make a fire-break 18 kilometres long on private and Crown land. This will reduce the fire risk in Belgrave South by 50 per cent.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        New applications will open in early January next year for another $1 million. Local groups, again, will be able to put in and well done to all those who received awards.
