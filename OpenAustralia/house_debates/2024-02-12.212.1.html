        I rise to acknowledge the residents of the Parramatta and Cumberland council areas who received awards in the

        , the much loved founder of the Rydalmere Lions Football Club. Peter has given 40 years of service to that club, and what a legacy he has built, creating an outstanding community club and an institution where families go to enjoy themselves and where kids have fun, get outdoors and play sport. There's not a single pokie in the entire club, just a wonderful family environment.

        There is also Councillor Sabrin Farooqui from Cumberland City Council, who's been recognised for her service to the community. Sabrin is the President of the Cultural Diversity Network and makes an outstanding contribution through all of her work in community groups and across the council. Another person who received an award was Sarkis Karam, a proud
