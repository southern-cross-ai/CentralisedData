        Each year I award the Dunkley Shield to a student chosen by each participating school in my electorate who has been found to be capable, compassionate and committed in all that they doâ€”in the school and amongst their peers, family, teachers and the wider community. It is the highest award that I give as the federal member of parliament for Dunkley. In late 2018 and early 2019 I awarded students at 42 Dunkley schools the Dunkley Shield for displaying these exceptional personal qualities. I'd like to congratulate those students from each suburb and village in my electorate.

        I congratulate all of these deserving students who are committed to improving themselves inside and outside of the classroom, and clearly they are students who reflect their school's values. As you can see, there were quite a number of award ceremonies that I attended late last year, some five or six in the one evening, But it's always great to go out to the local schools in Dunkley, and it's been a pleasure to attend the various ceremonies, awards, assemblies and graduations, to join the celebration of the success of our wonderfully talented students and to witness how many future leaders we have in our local area. Congratulations once again to all Dunkley Shield award winners over the last year. Thank you.
