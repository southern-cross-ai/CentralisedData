       <p>
        I recently travelled to Lakeland, located a few hundred kilometres north-west of Cairns, for the official opening of a new sporting oval and facilities. This wasn't just another sporting field or simply another opening. The sporting field was named in honour of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
         Cape York
        </a>
        legend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Wilson
        </a>
        . The Alan Wilson Oval is a fitting legacy to a person who has dedicated his life to serving his community in many different capacities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alan, who now lives in the Tablelands, has had many careers, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        police officer, my cattle station manager at Olive Vale in Cape York, publican and roadhouse owner. However, Alan has always been remembered as being a hardworking, passionate and dedicated councillor and deputy mayor with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Cook Shire Council
        </a>
        for over 16 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that Alan has always been remembered for is his decades-long campaign to see a container deposit scheme established in Queensland. His unwavering dedication paid dividends in the Queensland government's introducing the new, highly successful Containers for Change scheme. A lot of people told Alan it'd never be done, but it just goes to show what can be achieved by someone with the passion and dogged determination to change something for the better. Finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the Lakeland Progress Association, whose idea it was to name the new sports oval in honour of not only a Cape York legend but a very decent person and an all-round top bloke.
