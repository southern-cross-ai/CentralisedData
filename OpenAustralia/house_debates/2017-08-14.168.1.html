        On Saturday, I was honoured to represent the Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , at the official announcement of the naming of Lemnos Square in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Park
        </a>
        . Saturday also marked the second anniversary of the unveiling of the Lemnos Gallipoli Memorial, which was erected and unveiled on this site in 2015, marking the 100th anniversary of the Australian nurses' arrival on the island of Lemnos during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . It was sculpted by renowned artist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Corlett" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Corlett
        </a>
        . The statues comprise two evocative bronze figuresâ€”one of a nurse and the other the digger. It honours the role Australian nurses have played in the theatres of war more broadly, but specifically it honours their role on the Greek Island of Lemnos, which was the location of Australia's major hospital during the Gallipoli campaign.

       <p>
        Lemnos Square was formerly known as Foote Street Reserve. I want to thank the mayor of the city of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip" rel="nofollow">
         Port Phillip
        </a>
        , Councillor Bernadene Voss, for not only acknowledging the historical significance of the site in relation to our Anzac history but also acknowledging the large community of Greek migrants who have settled in the area and, in doing so, acknowledging the strong migrant history of Port Phillip. I also want to particularly thank Lee Tarlamis, the president of the Lemnos Gallipoli Commemorative Committee, and historian Jim Claven for their tireless efforts in raising awareness of the role of Lemnos in Australia's Anzac history. Both Lee and Jim have worked passionately and tirelessly to ensure that we are able to pay a fitting tribute to the nurses and diggers who served on Lemnos and those who are buried there and, through their effort and work, strengthening the bonds that exist between Greece and Australia.
