        I rise to honour the outgoing captain of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Mariners Football Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hutchinson" rel="nofollow">
         John Hutchinson
        </a>
        , a well-known resident of my electorate of Robertson. 'Hutch', as he is locally known, recently announced that this will be his last season wearing the distinctive yellow and navy jersey. His record both on and off the pitch is outstanding and I know he will be missed for his control and vision on the ball in the Mariners' midfield and for his legacy in helping to build such a strong culture at the club. He has demonstrated loyalty, dedication and a fighting spirit that has resonated on the pitch, in the dressing room and in our community across the Central Coast, most recently as a Gosford Australia Day Ambassador.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a foundation player, Hutch has competed in more than 260 competitive matches for the mighty Mariners, including in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC" rel="nofollow">

        Champions League, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFA" rel="nofollow">
         FFA
        </a>
        Cup and the old pre-season cup. But it is in the A-League where his contribution has been the most significant. In this coming weekend's derby against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Jets" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle Jets
        </a>
        , he has the opportunity to become the equal most capped player, alongside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Thompson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , in the 10-year history of the A-League, playing his 221st match. He became the Mariners' first championship winning captain in 2013 and also won the premiership with the club in 2008 and 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        My family and I are proud members of the Mariners and I am sure I speak for the 'yellow army' and football fans across the country in thanking John Hutchinson for his fantastic contribution to the Central Coast. You will be greatly missed.
