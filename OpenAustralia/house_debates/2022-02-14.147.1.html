        recipient is Lorna Clayton, a resident of the Living Choice retirement village in Glenhaven. Just after settling into her new home, Lorna set up a writing group. Lorna did a letterbox drop in the village and asked people if they were interested. She managed to get a handful of people involved to give talks about things they'd written. The writing group still meets once a month and has spawned the retirement village's annual writers festival.
