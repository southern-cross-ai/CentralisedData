        The good people of Moncrieff are working hard to build a better future for their families. They know that the Morrison government has their back. The federal budget delivers just that. There is, however, a lingering cause for anxiety as they look north to Brisbane and the Palaszczuk state government. They know that the Palaszczuk-Trad experiment that had ploughed Queensland well before the pandemic struck holds no hope for recovery now. They have also had a taste of Labor incompetence locally.

Of course, on the Gold Coast, there's a different title for the Premier and her assistant tourism minister, and that's 'Palaszczuk, chief economy wrecker, and her assistant minister for tourism industry destruction'.
