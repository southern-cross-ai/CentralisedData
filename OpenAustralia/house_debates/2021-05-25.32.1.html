        Meeting the immediate needs of our community feeds my daily work, as do the longer term opportunities that come from the many compounding challenges that we face together. While drought, bushfires, floods and border closures have drained our community, the experience has also mobilised people and their ideas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor's COVID-19 recovery task force recently toured the far
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        to hear not only firsthand accounts of our region's experience but also the local ideas that will best support our recovery and renewal. The task force had rich conversations with residents, charities and business groups across the region, including about mountain bike tourism, better mobile and internet service to enable our businesses to expand and grow, better housing options for our community that suit their needs, transport links that withstand floods and rain, cultural institutions that would bring new tourists to the area and things as simple as CBD upgrades. The findings from the visit will define a strong set of policies that will secure the future of regional communities. While it was great to hear from so many people and organisations, I know that there are so many stories and suggestions that still need to be heard. I encourage people to submit their thoughts through my website: www.kristymcbain.com.au. I'm determined to make sure that the work ahead reflects the insights of people that I represent. Regional communities understand the challenges, but, more than that, they are invested in our solutions, and I will back them.
