        I rise today to strongly support the start of the COVID-19 vaccination program. It was great to see World War

        survivor Jane be the first to get the jab, alongside the Prime Minister, in Sydney yesterday. It's an exciting time for Australia as we follow the first vaccinations being rolled out across our states and territories. Our rollout is starting with those who are most at risk and in need of protection. Under our vaccination rollout plan, quarantine and border workers and aged-care residents are on track to be vaccinated by April this year. I can assure you that, as soon as my age group comes up as part of the rollout, I will be rolling up my sleeve to get the vaccine, and I encourage all Ryan residents to do the same.

        These vaccines have been through a full and thorough assessment by the TGA, one of the best regulatory agencies in the world, and the vaccines are safe for us to take up. Delivering the vaccine is a key part of Australia's road to recovery and will enable us to move forward with our economic recovery knowing that we are protected and safe. When the vast majority of Australians are vaccinated, we'll be able to get back to a better level of normality. In particular, being a Queenslander, I want to see the end of the border lockdowns. These snap lockdowns have been devastating for Queensland families who have been stopped from seeing friends and family and particularly for businesses that have seen their trade thrown into disarray at a moment's notice. We've all sacrificed so much during this pandemic. Now let's take the final important step and get the jab together.
