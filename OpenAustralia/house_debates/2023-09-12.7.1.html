        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the committee's sixth report for 2023. This report considers a proposal referred in June from the Department of Defence for the redevelopment of the defence, science, technology group's Fishermans Bend site in Victoria. The Fishermans Bend site is a specialist science and technology research establishment of national significance that supports Australia's Defence Force and Australia's broader national security needs. The total cost of the proposed project is $161 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        After an inspection, the committee can confirm that the condition of the existing services at Fishermans Bend is poor and rapidly approaching its end of life. In its current state, these issues pose a risk to the current and future capability of the site. The upgrades will ensure that the site is compliant with all relevant Australian standards, Defence design guidelines and the National Construction Code, significantly prolonging the life of the site. The proposed works at Defence's Fishermans Bend site will also upgrade the entry precinct to improve security and traffic flow. The works will generate local industry employment opportunities and reduce the health and safety risks at the site by improving the interface between base users and local traffic, particularly at the existing entry point.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee would like to thank personnel from the Department of Defence for facilitating the site inspection and delivering a presentation in Melbourne. The site visit gave members of the committee an opportunity to explore the site, learn a bit of history and better understand the scope of the works that need to be carried out to keep the site operational for tomorrow. The committee would also like to thank the University of Melbourne, who are neighbours to the Defence site, for appearing at the public hearing and sharing their long-term vision for the Fishermans Bend employment precinct overall. The committee considers that this project represents value for money and is meritorious in terms of need, scope and cost. The committee recommends that it is expedient that the proposed work be carried out, and I'm supported by the deputy chair in making that statement. I commend the report to the House.
