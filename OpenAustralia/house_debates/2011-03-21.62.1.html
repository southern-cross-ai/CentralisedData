        Two weeks ago I had the opportunity of what I hope will be the first of many electorate tours, in the redistributed boundaries of Indi, throughout the shire of Murrindindi. It is home to some of the most beautiful scenery and spectacular surroundings in Australia. Of course, these changes will not be effective until the next election. It was a great opportunity for me, together with the refreshing and relatively new local state member for Seymour, Cindy McLeish, to speak with locals about their issues of concern and, of course, about the cost of living pressures that are hurting families, individuals and businesses.

        In a shire that was devastated—and still continues, in a very real way, to suffer from the impacts of the

        bushfires—these additional inflationary pressures and cost-of-living pressures are really being felt. Throughout the area of the

        </a>
        , people and businesses were shuddering at the prospect of a carbon tax that would further put pressure on local jobs and increase prices. Another theme that was repeated time and time again was the extraordinary amount, still, of red tape hampering reconstruction in the areas that were severely affected by the bushfires. Unnecessary regulation and time responses from officials are really having an impact on the positive outlook for rebuilding in these areas. I call on all levels of government to review and fast-track some of these processes.
