       <p>
        Last Saturday week, I visited Camp Kookaburra at the Anglican youth department camp in the national park in my electorate of Cook to congratulate Camp Kookaburra founder and Sutherland shire resident Dianne Madden on becoming the 2008
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Woman of the Year. Dianne formed Camp Kookaburra seven years ago to provide care and support to shire and St George children aged eight to 12 years who live with a parent, brother or sister with a mental illness. They are brave kids who love their families passionately and often act as primary carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the last seven years, Dianne and her fellow dedicated volunteers at Camp Kookaburra have given these children something very, very precious: the chance to be kids, to have a break, to meet new friends and to share their experiences in a safe and caring environment. The message to the kids at Camp Kookaburra is simple: they are not alone and they are deeply valued by our community. Dianne knows well the challenges faced by young children dealing with family members who have a mental illness. These children that she cares for often have parents who have committed or attempted suicide or who have been involved in various forms of alcohol and drug dependency. They have had to do it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dianne also did it tough in a time when our understanding of mental illness was not as great as it is today, having grown up in a family which was also characterised by mental illness. Dianne is able to use her experience and her deep understanding and knowledge of these issues to identify with these kids. At a recent camp, one of the kids said to her, ‘You wouldn’t understand what it’s like for me.’ She went and told that child her story. Later that day, as they were walking through the beautiful national park in my electorate, this child came up to her, held her hand and shared their story with her. These are the sorts of things that happen on a regular basis at Camp Kookaburra. It is a truly inspiring event that takes place once a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the kids at Camp Kookaburra and at other similar events have put together a quilt. The quilt, which is on display in various places around the Sutherland shire, tells the story of these young children’s experiences. It shows the emotion—the deep affection, care and love—they have for their parents and how they are seeking to deal with the challenges that, at such a young age, they really should not have to be dealing with.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, over 50 children attended Camp Kookaburra—up from 16 on their first camp. These children and their families also have the chance to be involved in two fun days a year and a family picnic day later in the year. It costs around $300 per child to support their involvement in the camp. I thank the many individuals and community organisations—in particular, the local Rotary clubs—whose generous contributions make Camp Kookaburra possible. It is an initiative that deserves strong community and government support. I acknowledge the support that the state government has given to this initiative, but a commitment needs to be made to it on an ongoing basis. It also needs significant support from the corporate sector and from individuals, not only in the shire but throughout St George and across New South Wales, to ensure that it can continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a privilege to accept Dianne’s invitation to meet with her volunteers and the kids during the most recent camp. I look forward to going back next year and doing all we can to support this important work. Following the camp, we have been able to arrange to get them a website, and the next step will be to write to

        s and other community workers to encourage them to refer families to the opportunities provided by Camp Kookaburra. I am also delighted that Dianne’s work has been recognised. Dianne is the New South Wales Woman of the Year. I would also like to commend the state member for Miranda,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Collier" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for nominating Dianne. Dianne’s passion is infectious and is matched only by the selfless volunteers and professionals who share this great work with her. Through their self-sacrifice and dedication, they have had a positive effect on the lives of many children who are in very difficult circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        The award also provides a great opportunity for getting the message out to our community and to families about the work of Camp Kookaburra in an effort to ensure that more kids get the opportunity to be part of this inspiring program. I also suggest that there is a very real opportunity for this program to be successfully implemented right around the country. I would encourage those members who are interested in learning more about Camp Kookaburra and those people who may be listening to this debate, wherever they may be, who know of an instance where they believe there is a child who could greatly benefit from this opportunity, even if it is for only 2½ days, to get in contact with my office and we can put them in contact with Camp Kookaburra.
