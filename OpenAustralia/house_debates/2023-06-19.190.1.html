        Across the electorate of Lyons a total of six community members were quietly recognised in the King 's Birthday honours for their service and dedication to their respective fields of expertise and their contributions to their communities. This afternoon I rise to congratulate each on their achievements. The following have been awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in appreciation of their contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terese Ann Binns, of Longford, was recognised for service to veterans and to the community. In February, Terese hosted a war animal remembrance ceremony at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Town
        </a>
        , along with the Northern Tasmanian Light Horse Troop, to recognise the animals that have served our country. It was a great pleasure to attend the service alongside Terese and Her Excellency Barbara Baker.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Malcolm Crosse, of Brighton, was awarded for his service to fly fishing. He has served on many fly fishing committees over his 50-plus years of involvement and has worked hard to promote the sport in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Susan Reppion-Brooke, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Norfolk" rel="nofollow">
         New Norfolk
        </a>
        , was recognised for her service to music education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lindsay Bourke of Sheffield was recognised for his significant service to the beekeeping and honey industry and to the communityâ€”and perhaps should have received one for his moustache.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commander Peter Harriss of the Tasmanian police force received an

        </a>
        for his service.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_George" rel="nofollow">
         Colin George

        of Dodges Ferry, who is a member of the Tasmanian ambulance service, received an Ambulance Service Medal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank each and every one of these fine Tasmanians for their service to the community and wish them all the best for 2024.
