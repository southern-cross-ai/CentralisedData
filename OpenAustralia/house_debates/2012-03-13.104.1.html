        I would like to acknowledge the fine achievements of Professor John Forbes AM who was recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        awards this year. He is an outstanding Australian committed to finding the right treatments and a cure for breast cancer. He serves as Director of the Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_Oncology" rel="nofollow">
         Surgical Oncology
        </a>
        at the Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital and the Professor of Surgical Oncology at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
         University of Newcastle
        </a>
        . He is also the Director of Research of the Australian New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group and has been recognised for his service to medicine in the field of breast cancer research and in the development of improved clinical trials.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has been a leader in breast cancer research not only in Australia but has also been a pioneer in breast cancer trials worldwide. He established the first national breast cancer trials along with his colleagues 30 years ago. Today 20 per cent of the breast cancer deaths that would have occurred 20 years ago are now avoided. It is a fine record in the area. It was my pleasure, along with the member for Hume and Professor Jim Denham and many of his colleagues in the medical and scientific community, to sponsor Professor Forbes for this award. It was long overdue. The difference he has made to so many women's lives is phenomenal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year I hold a breast cancer morning tea in my electorate. Professor Forbes, somebody with such a distinguished background, somebody who has made such a significant contribution to research and to the treatment of breast cancer, puts aside a morning in his busy schedule to come along and talk to women in my community about breast cancer and to help us raise funds for breast cancer research. He is totally dedicated and committed to finding a cure for breast cancer through breast cancer research and by understanding how breast cancer mutates within a woman's body. He is a man who has made an enormous commitment to his community and it is only right that he be recognised in the way he was this year in the Australia Day honours. A big thank you to Professor John Forbes: you are a fantastic man who is truly committed to helping women.
