       <p>
        With bushfire season approaching I would like to remind my constituents living in the Mitcham hills and upper Sturt that it is very important that they have a proper bushfire action plan and do what they can to support the efforts of the Sturt
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS" rel="nofollow">
         CFS
        </a>
        , which protects our local community. Earlier this year bushfires in Blair National Park served as a wake-up call for many residents of that area. From my recent discussions with the state emergency services minister, steps have been taken to minimise any future risk from freight trains in that area. However, it was a reminder that bushfire preparation is everybody's responsibility. A recent report described the area as 'a disaster waiting to happen', with low preparedness a major factor. I urge local residents to make sure that they have a comprehensive bushfire action plan in place. Just thinking 'I will leave early' is not enough. A proper plan helps you to take action and avoid making last-minute decisions that could prove deadly during a bushfire.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the also very important that you think about how you can help the CFS protect you. For example, parking illegally on the side of the road is an ongoing issue and particularly in that area can impede access for fire trucks. I would like to draw attention to the Sturt CFS tanker appeal. Currently they have only one tanker, which is not adequate. They are very close to achieving the goal of purchasing a second tanker. The community support has been great. They have raised $170,000 out of the required $200,000. I encourage local residents to help with their final funding push.
