         I do thank the member for Braddon for his question. It is very clear what is at stake here. On the one hand you have got the state government, which is planning to downgrade services at the Mersey hospital, and, on the other hand, you have got the Commonwealth government, which plans to preserve them, thanks to the advocacy of this great member for Braddon. Under the government’s plan, the Commonwealth will fund the hospital, the community will control the hospital and the hospital will deliver the same range of services as have been safely and effectively delivered at this hospital for many years.

         ’s plan is a $45 million a year addition to health services in Tasmania, and it will free up whatever the Tasmanian government is currently spending at the Mersey to improve services at other hospitals, such as Burnie and Launceston. This is a project of national significance. Having one level of government funding a hospital should end the blame game, and having a community trust controlling the hospital should stop or at least reduce the bureaucracy which so often strangles the delivery of public hospital services.

         Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition belatedly accepted the need for federal intervention in the delivery of health services in north-western Tasmania. Today he floated his plan. According to the Hobart

            There is one massive problem with this: it denies the people of the Mersey region comprehensive general hospital services for the five to 10 years which it would take for any new hospital to be built. There is a choice facing this Leader of the Opposition. He can come back to the state government and prove that on this, as on so many other issues, he is a patsy for the Premier or he can back the Prime Minister and demonstrate yet again that there is no case to change the government of this country. The only game this Leader of the Opposition can play is follow the leader. The only question is: which leader will he follow now?
