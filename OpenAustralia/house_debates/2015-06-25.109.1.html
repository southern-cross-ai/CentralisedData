        The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 4 December 2014. It also lists reports for which the House has not received a government response.

        The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response.

        Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are usually reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responses" rel="nofollow">
         Responses

        to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within six months of the tabling of a report.

       <p class="italic">
        1 The date of tabling is the date the report was presented to the House of Representatives or to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker
        </a>
        , whichever is earlier. In the case of joint committees, the date shown is the date of first presentation to either the House or the Senate or to the President or Speaker (if presented earlier out of session). Reports published when the House (or Houses) are not sitting are tabled at a later date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2 If the source for the government response date is not the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or the Journals of the Senate, the source is shown in an endnote.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3 For reports up to the end of 42nd Parliament, the time specified is three months from the date of tabling. While the Government has undertaken to continue to respond to reports within three months, from the 43rd Parliament (28 September 2010 onwards) the period within which the House requires a response is six months—see resolution of the House of Representatives of 29 September 2010. This resolution also puts in place additional steps for reports not responded to within that six month period. The period from when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013 and the commencement of the 44th Parliament on 12 November 2013 is not included in the response period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4 In correspondence dated 22 December 2014, the Minister for Communications wrote to the committee in relation to the report, advising that since the report was first tabled many of the issues raised and the recommendations contained in the report have been addressed, implemented or superseded by the advent of new technologies and government policies. Accordingly, the committee no longer expects a response to this report. A copy of the correspondence has been made available on the committee's website. This listing will be removed from the next schedule.

        6 Since July 2011 the Government has advised that it does not intend to respond to the report because of the time elapsed since the report was tabled. The committee no longer expects a response to this report. This listing will be removed from the next schedule.

       <p class="italic">
        8 In December 2013 the Government advised that it did not intend to respond to the report as this matter is being considered as part of the Government's Financial System Inquiry. Since December 2014 the Government has advised that it does not intend to respond to the report because of the time elapsed since the report was tabled. The committee no longer expects a response to this report. This listing will be removed from the next schedule.

       <p class="italic">
        10 A response to this report is no longer expected, as the issues covered in the report have been superseded by Queensland State policy. This listing will be removed from the next schedule.

        11 The committee still awaits a response to this report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        12 Since December 2014 the Government has advised that the need for a response was overtaken by legislation introduced by the previous Government and passed by the previous Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        13 On 7 February 2012 the Government provided a statement regarding the reasons for the delay in presenting the response, in accordance with the House resolution of 29 September 2010 on government responses to committee reports. The Government advised that the 37 recommendations required detailed consideration and analysis, and that as an interim response to the report, and to progress the priority measures, the Government intended to introduce legislation in the 2012 Autumn sittings. Since December 2014 the Government has advised that given the passage of time and the change of government, the Government does not intend to respond to the report.

        16 In June 2009 the Government advised that it did not intend to respond formally to this report. In November 2009 the Government indicated a response was being considered and would be tabled in due course. In November 2011 and December 2013 the Government indicated it was in discussion with the committee on this matter. In July 2014 the Government advised that the Independent Contractors Act 2006 was assented to on 1 December 2006 and that the Government's response was covered during debate on the Bill. The committee has not agreed to the removal of this report from the schedule.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        17 On 22 June 2015, during debate on the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015, the Senate noted that the Government has not responded to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications report on its inquiry into information technology pricing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        18 In December 2014 the Government advised that it will not be tabling a response to this report and commented that the committee's report was effectively responded to by the enactment of the Coastal Shipping (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012 under the previous Government. The Government indicated that it is considering options to improve regulation of Australian shipping.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        19 In the Advisory report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014, presented on 27 February 2015, in addition to recommendations relating to the bill, the committee recommended that the Government provide a response to the outstanding recommendations from the committee's 2013 Report of the Inquiry into Potential Reforms of Australia's National Security Legislation by 1 July 2015. On 24 June 2015, in the Government's response to the previous schedule dated 4 December 2014, the Government indicated that it intended to respond to the outstanding recommendations to this report by 1 July 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        20 Reviews of this nature containing a standard recommendation in relation to the listing do not typically require a response. However, the Government tabled a response to this report on 12 May 2015.

        23 On 4 December 2014 the Government provided an interim response to the report, advising that the committee's report is informing the Government's White Paper, which is being prepared.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
         The White Paper
        </a>
        will set out a clear and well defined policy platform for unlocking the full potential of the north, including actions through to 2030. The Government indicated that it will respond to the committee's specific recommendations through the White Paper.
