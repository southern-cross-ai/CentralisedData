       <p>
        Cook Mine is an underground coal colliery located approximately 30 kilometres south of the town of Blackwater in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . It is owned by Caledon Coal. Early in March, a significant water inflow occurred at the mine. The inflow of water in the longwall section has been contained. The water level is being gradually lowered, but this will take time. The inflow of water fully inundated the longwall face and equipment. It was fortunate that no person was drowned or injured. The company is still ascertaining the full impact of the water damage.

        quarry is Caledon's sole operating asset and sole source of income. Regrettably, it has been necessary to stand down some workers at this time. This will affect approximately 275 workers. Employees can take annual leave or long service entitlements for the period they are being stood down. This is not a decision the company takes lightly, but it is necessary in the circumstances. It could be two months; it could be longer; it could be less. We do not know. This uncertainty is affecting the Blackwater community, with residents who work at Cook Colliery considering where they can go and what they can do, waiting day by day and in limbo. This is another blow for the proud town of Blackwater, but we will survive. Thank you.
