        The creator of this initiative, Juliet Moody, is with us here today in the chamber with her husband, Nick. On behalf of this parliament, Juliet, I want to acknowledge and congratulate you on your outstanding achievement. You are the light surrounded by a dark subject, and you inspire and empower more people than you'll ever realise. Congratulations, and thank you for encouraging and empowering people to live a life free of fear.
