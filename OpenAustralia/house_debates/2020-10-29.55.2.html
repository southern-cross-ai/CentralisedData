        Earlier today the member for Fowler and Chief Opposition Whip, a much loved member of this chamber, I think by all, had a sudden medical event in the Federation Chamber. He recovered pretty quickly, and I've spoken with Bernadette, who is with him in hospital, where he will stay overnight for further tests.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        thank Dr Freelander, who happened to be in the chair in the Federation Chamber at the time, Dr Gillepsie, who rushed up to the Federation Chamber to provide assistance, and all those members on both sides who acted with care and compassion. I thank the Prime Minister for his call to me about Chris's health. He is in good spirits, and we all wish him a very speedy recovery. I say to the Chief Opposition Whip: if he wants leave, he should just ask for it. There are easier ways to get it than what occurred this morning. I look forward to him being back in this chamber in good health.

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for keeping us informed about Chris's healthâ€”I'm sure the House won't mind indulging me in using the member's first name, without using his title, in this place. We may disagree on many things in this place, but I think we all agree that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Hayes
         </a>
         is a very good bloke. Many of us know Bernadette as well. She's been a welcome person around this place for many, many years. She is well known to many of our partners, spouses, wives and husbands in this place, and she has played an active role in supporting and counselling on so many other occasions the spouses and partners of people in this place. Our prayers with you, Bernadette, and with Nicholas, Jonathan and Elizabeth. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the update. We wish you all the best, Chris. I also thank you, Mr Speaker, for your role. You dealt with this very sensitively today, and I'm sure that was appreciated by all.
