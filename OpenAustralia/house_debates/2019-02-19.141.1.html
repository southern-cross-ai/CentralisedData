        This year the Lismore Lantern Parade, an iconic community arts festival, is turning 25 years old. Held near the longest Saturday night of the year, the winter solstice, the parade attracts tens of thousands of people. It is thanks to the vision of the creative director, Jyllie Jackson, who is literally the heart and soul of this event. She wanted to see the streets of Lismore light up with creativity and community spirit. The local economy also benefits, with the event injecting more than $2 million into the local economy. The festival celebrates community, arts, crafts, workshops, regional cuisine, the parade, lanterns, parade bands, street theatre, music, carnival dancers, illuminated puppets, fire art and pyrotechnics. It is a very colourful night. The theme last night was wonderland. Lismore was transformed into a colourful fantasyland.

        Last year's parade was the largest in its history, with 1,000 lanterns taking part and around 30,000 spectators enjoying the night. Partners in the event included LightnUp, Lismore City Council, the

        The event Think Pink Broady is an example of what a vibrant community can do to raise money for breast cancer research. Over the last six years, for one night pink has been the favourite colour of Broadwater. Thanks to Sheree Hyslop and her team, Think Pink Broady has helped raise nearly $25,000 for the Cancer Council. Given that in 2016 there were only 640 people living in Broadwater, this is an amazing result. Sheree's team consists of her husband, Steve; daughter, Mikayla; son, Lachlan; and Carmen Ainsworth, Natalie Piggott, Vicki McLennan, Tenille Leahy, Robyn Haselden, Yvonne Sawtell, Sheree Gaiter, Maxine Gaiter, Erin Gollan and Sharon Haselden.

I would like to acknowledge them: Drew Pierce, McGrath Estate Agents Ballina, Kirstie Bonnici, Jeb Walton, Mick Sawtell Electrical, Tom and Tenille Leahy from North Coast Building, Jesse and Cassie from Nothern Rivers Jumping Castles, Liberty Broadwater, Simone Briggs, Megan Pignat from Waves Dance Studio, Broadwater Bowling Club, Ballina Power Equipment,
